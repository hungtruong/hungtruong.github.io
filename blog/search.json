        "content": "My new IDE which I will probably drop soon! I’ve been using Google Antigravity as my main AI-powered IDE for the past month or two. But something tells me I’ll probably switch soon, as Google keeps making it less and less useful. In the meantime, though, I’ve added a ton of new features to my blog, and I figured I’d write about some of them. Hitting Antigravity Quota Jail I was using Claude Opus for a while with Antigravity, as the limits were pretty generous and renewed every 5 hours, similar to Claude Code and Codex. I actually think that Google gave more Opus usage than Claude Code itself did! At least at the time I was trying it out. I found that Gemini 3 Pro is good enough, but why not use Opus if I have access to it anyway? I was using an extension to track how much remaining quota I had. Unfortunately, it seems like I may have used too much, because Claude Opus and Sonnet began resetting on a weekly basis instead of every 5 hours. My remaining Claude quota which updates every week, now. I suppose that it’s probably not profitable for Google to provide this much Claude for a cheaper subscription (I’m on the $20 plan). But then they shouldn’t really imply that you’re going to get that much usage from the beginning. It feels a lot like a bait and switch. Others on the Antigravity subreddit also feel like the IDE was better before. It was about a week ago that I started getting the week-long refreshes on Opus. At that time I just switched over to Gemini 3 Pro and Flash to do my work instead. I favored Pro since, why not, I’m a pro! But after using up the quota a few times on that model, I got the banhammer for the pro models as well! So now I have a week-long wait to get my Anthropic and Gemini Pro models back to this stupid IDE. So anyway, now I’m just hanging on with Gemini 3 Flash resetting every 5 hours. Maybe I’ll get hit with a weekly refresh on that, too! At that point I’ll just switch to using Gemini CLI since it seems like it uses a separate method of calculating quotas. I already wrote a whole blog post about my process of adding audio articles (which sound like they’re read by me) to my blog with Qwen3-TTS. I mentioned that I used AI, and the models that I used were mainly Gemini 3 Pro and Flash due to Opus being drained. Semantic Search With Embeddings! Since my blog is actually a static site hosted on GitHub Pages and generated by Jekyll, it takes a bit of work to make it seem dynamic. I had initially vibe-coded a simple search based on a JSON index that had the text and tags of each blog post, that basically did keyword matching in a text field. That worked pretty well, but I’ve never had a chance to use text embeddings, even though people say that they’re pretty useful. I figured that I could learn something about text embeddings and also add semantic search to my blog. Like killing two birds with one stone, if you’re into that sort of thing. I basically had AI talk me through how it would work, and then I had it implement it for me. But I do feel like I have a better grasp of how semantic vector search stuff works, even if I can’t really think of a good reason to use it besides over-engineering my blog search. My first naive attempt to implement this was using bge-m3 , which AI told me was a really good embedding model. But when I tested out the search, I was getting some pretty bad matches. It seemed like nothing matched higher than 50%, and I got some irrelevant matches for queries that seemed pretty simple. Once I asked AI why this was happening, it mentioned that I wasn’t using all of bge-m3’s capabilities, since Cloudflare could only store a fraction of the data. That would’ve been nice to know before it told me to use bge-m3! Anyway, I switched over to using qwen3-embedding-0.6b which is also supported by Cloudflare’s Vectorize product. The semantic search is still more of a toy at this point, but it did return a post about Pokemans when I search for “pikachu” (the blog post doesn’t contain the word ‘pikachu’ in it). Testing out semantic search with a query for \"Pikachu\" I also set up a GitHub workflow so that every time I update my blog, the index is updated in case I add a new post, or edit an existing one (or I guess if I delete one but why would I do that?). I’ve been trying to automate as much as possible with my blog so that I have less friction to just write in it. Replaced Staticman With a Cloudflare Worker I recently added comments back to my blog using Staticman , which is an interesting concept, but kind of overkill for me and my blog. I didn’t have anywhere to host it, so I was just hosting it on my home server and exposing it to the internet with Cloudflare tunnels. This seemed okay but if my home internet connection went down then no one would be able to comment on my blog! That would be like a Sev 1 in this household. Since Staticman is open source, I just had Antigravity look at the repo, and make an API-compatible endpoint with Cloudflare Workers that I could point my blog’s comment form to. It took surprisingly little time, and from there I was able to add all sorts of features like spam checking (with AI of course) and rate limiting, etc. I’m not too worried about Cloudflare going down but if it does then the internet probably has bigger issues than not being able to comment on my blog. Jekyll or Not? I was actually considering moving my blog off of Jekyll since the technology is old and I’ve been wanting to spruce up my blog a bit. But I realized that Jekyll is pretty flexible in terms of adding features in a way that not every blogging platform is. I can just prompt an AI to add a feature, and Jekyll is extensible enough to just let me do whatever. Also, it’s kind of nice that the site is static and doesn’t use any computing resources aside from the search feature I added. For now I’ll just keep my blog the way it is. I feel like I stopped blogging as much after it became kind of a pain to edit markdown files, etc. But now that I can edit posts with AI, I actually find blogging with markdown to be a bonus. Adding a link is probably about the same amount of work with the prompt “Add this link __ to line __ .” But it’s also kinda cool to ask the AI to fact check my blog and spellcheck it so I don’t make as many stupid mistakes. Anyway, that’s basically what I’ve added to my blog so far. It’s pretty fun adding features to it, even though no one will read it. Or maybe if I add more features, people will finally start to notice it! Nah!"

        "url": "/blog/2026/01/27/adding-audio-to-my-blog-with-qwen3-tts-voice-cloning/",
        "content": "Qwen3-TTS, the best TTS model I've used so far! I saw a note in my daily AI newsletter about a new TTS model that was out. I spent a better part of the day testing out its capabilities and attempting to do some fine tuning on it. I’ve had a goal for a pretty long time to add audio versions that people can use to listen to each of my blog posts. But rather than narrate them myself, I wanted the audio to be computer generated. Not only that, but I wanted it to sound like I was actually doing the narrating. So far, any of the models that I’ve tried to accomplish this haven’t lived up to the high standards of quality that you’re used to seeing on my blog. So did Qwen3-TTS finally make the grade? When I looked at the Qwen3-TTS GitHub , I noticed that it had a few ways to generate audio from text. You could just use a pre-configured voice, and even give it instructions on how to speak. You could also design a voice, clone a voice from a reference audio, or even do fine tuning on the model and then generate from that. I initially set up a Kaggle notebook to test out the audio generation capabilities. I had an old dataset from a previous experiment of me reading the beginning of one of my blog posts. The audio quality was pretty bad, but I didn’t want to record any new stuff just yet. The voice cloning seemed to work pretty well! I decided to see if I could actually fine tune a model since that should get me even better results! When Fine Tuning Goes Wrong I ended up using a better mic that I bought for making YouTube videos (which I only used once so far) and recorded some more samples of myself reading from some of my blog posts. This time I used Logic Pro and messed with some plugins to make sure the audio sounded somewhat decent. I ended up recording about 30 files and decided that was probably enough for fine tuning. I used Google Antigravity to make another Kaggle notebook for me and iterated on the code until it actually worked. I ran into out of memory issues (the Kaggle GPUs max out at 16GB) and had to use the smaller model. I think somewhere in all of the hacks that Gemini used to get the training to complete, something got messed up because I could only manage to infer gibberish from the trained model. This is My Voice on Fine-Tuning. Any Questions? I might need to actually train for longer, or use more voice samples, or maybe both. I just happen to be too lazy to do it right now since I already wasted like 4 hours on it. I also read some comments on GitHub that the fine-tuned model doesn’t work that well so I decided to just give up for now. Voice Cloning Instead Since I had found some early success in voice cloning, I decided to see how far I could get with that. I used a longer section of recording for my “reference audio” which is about 30 seconds long. After that I tried a 1.5 minute clip, which had some more variety to it. Now I’m wondering if I could throw a 30 minute clip at it just to get all of my nuances in there but something tells me that at a certain point, you get diminishing returns (and blow up the GPU RAM). Ground Truth Audio Generated Audio I set up a new Kaggle notebook that would scrape the text from my blog, then break it up into sentences and generate a TTS voice clone of myself speaking each sentence. Then it would stitch all of the audio files together into a giant spoken article podcast thing! I used a similar method when I wrote that Siri feature that reads articles to you . The results ended up sounding really good! In the past, I’ve tried this same technique and got a voice that somewhat resembled mine, but it would talk in an almost southern drawl. It was super hilarious, but also not accurate. The Qwen3-TTS model gets the cadence and prosody of my speech down pretty well, all with a one-shot example! Sure, the TTS doesn’t get everything perfectly the way I would read things, but it’s good enough for me! My Previous Attempt Where I Sounded Texan Adding a Podcast To My Blog I started looking for projects that I could use to incorporate the audio article into my actual blog. Sort of like the transcript feature in YouTube where you can skip to sections by clicking on text. I found this project called Hyperaudio that fit the bill. Since the audio is generated from text that was lifted directly from my blog anyway, I could just generate a subtitle file while generating the blog post audio. That way I wouldn’t have to mess with something like Whisper or another ASR system which would probably be really inaccurate. Since I generate my blog with Jekyll, it was pretty simple to add another value to my frontmatter, and then conditionally add a script that would add the tags for Hyperaudio to hook into. Plus it was super simple because I just had AI do it for me! I think it’s a fun feature that makes my blog more accessible, and I’d much rather have someone listen to my blog in my own voice, or at least a pretty good approximation to it. So now you can listen to me read my blog to you, skip to sections by clicking on the text in the blog, and see the current sentence being highlighted. Future Improvements I’m pretty happy so far with how this feature works. One thing that’s annoying, though, is that it requires the blog post to already exist before I can generate audio for it. That’s kind of a chicken and egg problem, and hard to solve. I don’t want to generate an audio file for a blog post and then immediately have to make a new one because I changed a word somewhere. But it would be nice to publish the audio and the blog post at the same time. I already set up a GitHub action to run from the Kaggle notebook after it uploads the files to Cloudflare storage. It picks up the new files, adds the frontmatter to the blog post, and then redeploys my blog. Sometimes I just love being a software nerd. I’m currently filling out the backlog of my posts with audio, so you may or may not see audio on them until I get to it. I guess at some point, if a better voice cloning TTS model comes out, I could update the files again, but for now they should do the job nicely!"

        "content": "Two puns in and we haven't even hit a paragraph yet. I recently started taking one of these trendy weight loss pills, and since my blog always gets spam comments from people trying to sell the stuff, I figured I could just make a whole post about it. That way the rest of my blog posts will be safe from spam, right? It’s been about a week since I started taking the wegovy pill which just came out this year. I think I literally got it about a week after it was officially available. I had seen an article about how this new oral form was recently approved , and I did a bit of research on it. Before that, I had been pretty uninterested in taking it, but the more I read about how the drug actually worked, the more interested I was in it. #myweightlossjourney™ If you’re tired of reading about people’s struggles with weight loss, etc, you can probably skip this part, I’m just including it because maybe it’s relevant later? I’ve always felt overweight, ever since I was a kid. Probably because I was pretty fat as a kid. I attribute this to a few things, one being that I was taught to always finish all of my food (my grandma would tell us that for every grain of rice we wasted, we would have to eat a maggot when we died and went to heaven (or hell?)) and also that I really love eating food! Also my mom would buy me hella snacks from our membership at Costco. I had a pretty dope childhood tbh. There’s a lot of research about obesity and who knows what the actual causes are. It’s not like I blame my family for being fat or anything. I think our society loves to blame individuals for being overweight, but it’s probably some combination of environment plus personal choices plus OMG DORITOS ARE SO FUCKING DELICIOUS! Marketing this good should be illegal. Anyway, I’ve tried to lose weight with many different techniques in the past, with varying levels of success. I tried playing DDR (yes, really), I did Keto for a few years but it really sucked, especially as a vegetarian. I wrote a freakin’ app to track my bike rides! I’ve also tried just eating less. I think the problem with these diets is that they’re so far from what my baseline of what I naturally want to do is, that I’ll just start gaining weight again once I stop doing the special thing. Recently I decided to care less about weight and more about fitness. About 1.5 years ago, I started strength training with weights and also exercising on a Concept2 RowErg (just name dropping this brand, iykyk). I think it’s been good for my general health levels, but it’s probably not a great idea to go into bulk mode for a year and a half without cutting… Anyway, this gets us to the current state of things. My vitals look pretty good, e.g. my resting heart rate has been looking great, and I honestly feel healthier than I did when I was 10 years younger due to being more active. But I figured that there are also negative health outcomes that are more likely with a higher BMI. So let’s try something different! You Down With GLP? I mentioned doing research on Semaglutide drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy and Rybelsus. I had previously read something about how they just make you hate eating which sounds horrible, so I figured they weren’t for me. The truth is a bit more nuanced, though. From what I understand (from asking AI), the drugs work by making you digest stuff more slowly, along with controlling your insulin production. These two things can help you lose weight because they even out your hunger levels. I think I’m usually pretty good about not overeating my main meals, but I do have a serious snacking problem, so this helps a lot. There are some other health benefits, like reduced chance of heart issues and less inflammation, which seems like a bonus. But whenever I look at holistic medicine, technically everything seems to reduce inflammation, so ¯\\ (ツ) /¯ ? There are some risks are kidney and gallbladder stuff, and some rare Thyroid cancer, I guess. I mean, if you’re looking for more info on this drug, you can do a better job than checking this blog! I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect when I started, but many forum posts mention nausea and other digestive issues as the main side effect. Luckily, I haven’t had too much of that. I think that the nausea is mainly due to people eating like normal when their body is digesting more slowly, so it causes a food backup. Even before starting on the drug (while I was waiting for my prescription to be filled), I started being more mindful about my portions, and basically got ready to eat less. Sema-glutide Kind of Life So after a week of being on this “miracle drug,” here’s my impressions (this is probably the part you wanted to read). I did notice that my head felt a bit fuzzy, maybe due to how the drug messes with your glucose levels, and at night I actually felt cold (I sleep super hot) which was very different for me. Those side effects have seemed to wane over the week, though. In terms of my fitness plan, I was concerned that my pumps wouldn’t be as good, but I actually did a bit better than the previous week when I finally decided to pump some iron. When I used the rowing machine, I noticed that I felt a bit less energy towards the end of my workout, but my muscles also didn’t feel as sore as they usually do at the end. So overall, I don’t think the drug had too much of an effect, which is great. I asked AI what I would look like in a month and this is what it spit out. So generally speaking, my first week on this drug has been pretty good! The main thing that I’ve noticed is that I don’t really have a desire to eat junk food, either sweet or salty, which I used to have a weakness for. I had predicted that this would make me sad, but surprisingly it doesn’t. My sentiment was even echoed in some Reddit posts I found about people talking about their “last meal” before going on the drug, like they were on death row! I definitely felt some joy in smashing a whole bag of Doritos (I swear this blog post isn’t sponsored by them), but that’s also balanced out by the feeling of being a pig and also potential tummy aches later. In retrospect, it sounds kind of silly that I would miss having the urge to binge on snacks, because that’s like saying I would miss the addiction of smoking meth or shooting up heroin (I haven’t tried either yet so maybe I would?). My initial fear of not enjoying food also seems to have been misguided. Food still tastes good to me (at least on my current starter dose). I just eat less of it before I feel satisfied with it. And once I’m satisfied, why would I want more? Without the drug, that satisfaction is elusive, or it never comes, and then you realize you ate a whole frozen pizza. One weird thing that healthy people tell fat people is that they just need to start enjoying healthy food. But I don’t think that really comes naturally, otherwise they wouldn’t be fat. One thing I’ve noticed is that my perception of food has changed for whatever reason. I noticed while having a veggie burger and fries that the Heinz ketchup I used tasted super sweet. It was almost too sweet! Earlier that day I noticed that some honey flavored Greek Yogurt that I’ve had in the past tasted way sweeter than before. It definitely threw me off and made me wonder if I should even be eating it. Even an Apple tasted like candy. (Editor’s note, I’m so used to capitalizing Apple that I did it here even though I’m talking about the fruit. I’m leaving it in because it’s funny) I think this is what “healthy” people mean when they’re talking down to fat people about eating “healthy.” My suspicion is that there’s a biological/scientific component and it’s not just about fat people being dumb and lazy and eating like shit for no reason. I realize how obvious that sounds but that’s also the way fat people are treated in real life, so… Previously the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. Now? Maybe ok! I remember trying an organic ketchup brand once, it was probably the Portland one, and t..."

        "title": "First Impressions of OpenAI's Sora 2 + App",
        "url": "/blog/2025/10/01/openais-sora-2/",
        "content": "Your browser does not support the video tag. New AI video model == New video of me eating spaghetti! OpenAI just released a new version of Sora, their video generation model. I spammed reload on a thread on Reddit to get an invite code last night, and quickly hit the rate limit (it was 71 videos)! Here’s my first impressions on the new app and model. The main features of Sora 2 (and the new app ) are that you can make short form (like 10 second) videos just by prompting, and you can also insert yourself into videos. This is pretty interesting because previously you’d have to either train a LoRA ( like I did ) or maybe use a static image of yourself as a starting frame which would inevitably drift away from looking like you. Onboarding The onboarding of the app is pretty interesting. To make a “cameo,” which is the term for inserting your likeness into a video, you need to record a short video of yourself saying some numbers and looking around. At first I thought the numbers were just to verify that you were recording a live video, but I think it’s also to capture your voice for voice cloning. The voice that the AI uses for me sort of sounds like me but not quite. It’s probably because I was mumbling the numbers. Once you upload the video, you can just tag yourself in videos that you want to generate. You can also determine who can make videos with your likeness through some permissions. Like if you only want friends to be able to make cameos of you. Generation I was interested in seeing how good the video generation was, and how creative you can be with the app. I think there must be some prompt rewriting magic being done after your initial prompt, because you can use a really vague prompt and still get an interesting video with an actual plot. I just prompted “username farting” and it came up with this gem: Your browser does not support the video tag. Me farting, complete with awkward dialogue. I also noticed that the notifications that the app sends out will describe the video in a way that might include more info than in your initial prompt. You'll see the content violation notification a lot. OpenAI is obviously going to be pretty risk-averse here when it comes to content moderation. When you enter a prompt that hits its guardrails, you’ll get a message that your generation failed. The annoying thing is that you can’t really tell if a prompt will run into a guardrail until you try generating the video. I’ve used identical prompts where one generation works fine and another hits a content block. For example, I tried recreating this AI boulder video that people are talking about where some lady busts a Chinese glass bridge and people fall into the water. I was able to prompt it to get something similar. One time it failed and I just retried with the exact same prompt and it worked. There must be a few stages where the content is checked, at least one before generation and maybe one that watches the video once it’s finished. I tried remixing this video with Sam Altman instead of me and it kept failing, even though the only change was the person with the boulder. Your browser does not support the video tag. In hindsight, bringing a boulder to a glass bridge was a terrible idea. This brings up another point I want to make about Sora and OpenAI in general. I’ve been noticing this for a while, but it seems kinda funny and weird to me that Sam Altman is increasingly the face and brand of OpenAI. I remember seeing Sam in his multiple colorful polo shirts as a bro, showing off Loopt at the Apple Keynote in 2008. I also remember meeting him once when we were doing a company offsite when I worked at FarmLogs (he was an investor and I think in charge of YCombinator at the time, and FL was a YC company). In addition to being an investor/tech startup builder guy, I guess he also wants everyone to know who he is. SamA is ready to star in your video! Sama (as he’s called) is available to cameo in pretty much any video you want to make. There’s some viral ones of him shoplifting GPUs from Target for Sora inference. And also a bunch of scammy ones where people make him beg for likes so he’ll give you an invite code. I can’t imagine being so full of myself that I’d want to sign up for this kind of publicity. But I guess Sama is just built different. He does seem like a bit of a psychopath but whatever, now he’s the de facto mascot of OpenAI! Inconsistent Moderation? So I keep running into issues where I can’t moonwalk or make myself a chef who’s being absolutely destroyed by Guy Fieri’s criticism on Diners Drive-ins and Dives, but for some reason there’s like a million videos of Pikachu on Sora. There’s also lots of videos of GTA V and other copyrighted stuff. It’s been interesting to see how people get around these guardrails, though. For example, I can’t say that I want a video of myself as Kramer in Seinfeld. But I can say that I’m busting through Jerry’s apartment door in a 90s sitcom and saying “Giddyup, Jerry!” which will work. I did notice though that the actors portraying Jerry only bear a passing resemblance to Jerry Seinfeld (kind of like the episode inside an episode of Seinfeld). Your browser does not support the video tag. Sitcom-style apartment entrance cameo. Other Interesting Stuff I recorded my cameo proof video in front of a brick fireplace wearing a striped shirt. I noticed that in most of my videos I’m wearing that striped shirt, and if I don’t add a lot of detail to my prompt, I’ll end up getting a video in that exact same spot in my house. I guess that isn’t surprising that the system will associate me with the location of the recording but it’s also kind of weird to see my home show up in videos. If you watch enough videos on your feed, you’ll probably also notice that many of the Sam Altman videos are just him in front of a white background. I believe that this probably matches his own cameo setup video environment. The Feed I guess I should also talk about the social aspect of Sora. One of the weirdest things about this product launch is that it’s a social app. You can add “friends” who can make videos of you, and you can even have multiple cameos in a single video. I haven’t added any “friends” yet but eventually I might get there. There’s also a “For You” feed which is currently inundated with socially engineered clickbait. Like videos claiming that if you double tap (which makes you like the post) you’ll see some special emoji. I’m honestly surprised that OpenAI didn’t consider that people will try to game the system this way. It’s a bad user experience because these videos are boring and often contain the same exact script, just with different people talking. True AI slop. I did manage to find some interesting videos, where people have the same instinct to make fun of Sam Altman and his double polo shirts. One of the first videos I made was of him announcing Loopt 2 wearing 5 polo shirts with giant collars! So there are some gems but they’re truly hidden behind the slop. I guess if you want you can follow my account, it’s hungtruongy because somehow I didn’t get “hungtruong” in time. Conclusion Your browser does not support the video tag. I was cake this whole time! Sora 2 is really a huge step forward in AI video generation. It’s incredibly impressive. Which is why it’s kind of tragic that this technology is currently just being used to make shitty slop. I’m hopeful that through moderation and algorithming, it could actually end up being an interesting platform. I’ve also read that the true value of this technology is through ads. Like imagine how much brands would love to offer making a cameo of you wearing their clothing so you’ll buy it. Which makes the announcement a few days ago about an AI agent purchase protocol a lot more obvious in hindsight. I had a lot of fun making videos of myself (and hitting the rate limits). I’m sure other people will too. I’m guessing some creative people will find a really cool use for this, or it..."

        "url": "/blog/2025/09/27/cleaning-out-my-bookmarks/",
        "content": "A snapshot at my incredibly outdated bookmarks. I was adding a bookmarklet to my web browser this morning ( to auto-click on American Express offers ) and was trying to figure out how to organize it so it’s easy to click when I want to find it. I realized that I have like a billion bookmarks that I’ve added to my bookmarks bar, etc, but I almost never directly use any of my bookmarks. I figured I should clean out my browser bookmarks and organize them since it’s been a while since I’ve touched them. I realized that I haven’t really been adding bookmarks to anything, since I mostly just go to Reddit or a handful of other websites that just show me new stuff. In our current fast paced world, I can’t even imagine reading something and then wanting to go back and read it again… A few years ago I learned the keyboard shortcut for going directly to the address bar (CMD + L if you’re curious) and that’s also pretty much eliminated the need for me to use bookmarks, since it’s faster for me to just hit that shortcut and start typing. I also aliased all of my locally run apps that run on web servers, like homeassistant.local, for example, so I don’t need to use port numbers in urls, e.g. 10.0.0.1:8123. So I started going through my bookmarks, and boy, are they old! A few are apartments in Seattle that I was thinking about moving into after I graduated from grad school (I moved into this one ). There’s a syllabus to a class I took in grad school ( the link broke ). And hilariously there are also links to corporate intranet sites for multiple different companies that I worked for, including Microsoft, Amazon and Apple that I never bothered removing. I also bookmarked a ton of articles about development. Things like how to implement in-app purchases in iOS, or customizing the UITabBar on iOS 5. Or the best way to start a Django project in 2012 ! Even the gist recognizes this is a bit outdated... There are also a bunch of low carb keto recipes that I saved, a few of which I actually made and then highly regretted making. I also have a bookmark to my friend Lorenzo’s blog which I’ll keep because it’s a good reminder to go check out his blog every now and then, and he’s another O.G. blogger like me! I think it’s really interesting that bookmarks are a feature that has rarely changed in browsers. From Mosaic to… whatever the latest AI browser is these days, they’ve all had bookmarks, and the feature is probably 99% the same as it was 30+ years ago (aside from maybe the bookmark bar and bookmarklets). It’s no wonder that I haven’t kept on top of pruning by bookmarks. Out of sight out of mind. I don’t really use them, so why would I need to clean them up? I can think of a handful of uses for bookmarks in my current day use. Use bookmarks as a hint I can use bookmarks as a hint that I want the browser to autocomplete what I’m typing. I’m not sure how useful this is since I think browsers also just know that I go to a certain site every single day, but it’s probably somewhat useful. Bookmarklets This would probably be my main usecase, to run a bookmarklet to bypass a paywall by pulling up an archived version, or clicking all the offers on the Amex site, or cancelling all of my Amazon subscribe and save orders since I only do that to save 5% or whatever the first time I buy something. Recipes Recipes are maybe the only other thing I’d use bookmarks for since I want to go back to them, but in a somewhat random fashion, and I don’t know if I trust Google to remember what “Zucchini Cheese Enciladas recipe” means every time I type it (though they are pretty good at that). I’d probably be better off just saving the recipe somewhere or **gasp ** printing it out, but whatever. Bye Bye Bookmarks I feel a bit bad removing a bunch of these bookmarks. But like Marie Kondo, I can acknowledge them, thank them for their service, and let them go. Plus I saved an archive somewhere of them anyway, in case I ever wanna look at them again!"

        "url": "/blog/2025/09/24/goodbye-claude-and-gemini-hello-codex/",
        "content": "Thanks, OpenAI for the plushie and the office tour (not real btw)! There’s been a few changes in the AI CLI landscape, so it’s time for a new blog post! I’ve once again switched my AI best friend. This time from Claude to OpenAI’s Codex . So since the last blog post I made about vibe coding with Claude Code and what I learned , it seems like Claude got really dumb. I actually let my subscription lapse so I could do other stuff (like play with text to video AI ) so I didn’t witness this firsthand. But judging from the Claude Code subreddit and even this official blog post from Anthropic, it sounds like there was quite the regression (which Anthropic didn’t even admit to for a while, and when they did, they didn’t compensate anyone for it). During that time I was pretty much using Gemini CLI again (which still kinda sucks, to be honest) and Atlassian’s Rovo CLI which can use Claude Sonnet and GPT5 with pretty nice free limits. I also tried Grok Fast or whatever it was called when it was free for a week but it didn’t seem to work that well for me. But after OpenAI announced GPT5 and later, GPT5 Codex, I was intrigued. I didn’t actually subscribe until I got an offer in my account for a free monthly trial of ChatGPT Business. So I have 5 seats of ChatGPT Business for a month right now (no one in my family accepted my offer to join my team, for some reason). I’ve been testing Codex out, and so far it’s been pretty much as good or better than Claude Code was when I was trying that. I did notice that ChatGPT Codex takes a bit longer to ramp up, but once it does, the output quality is great. I also had it on the “High” setting, which I’ve been keeping it on for the most part. The Anime Nano Test A couple of days ago I got an email from someone about Anime Nano , my anime blog post aggregator. They updated their blog and wanted to log in, but there wasn’t a password recovery feature for them to reset their password. When I saw the message I jumped out of my chair and started getting to work! Mostly because no one has really talked to me about Anime Nano in ages and it was validation that my website was still relevant! And it would be a great test to see how well Codex could work. I went to work, prompting Codex to implement an email based password reset feature. I had already implemented one at some point, probably when Anime Nano was built on Django, so I already had some database fields ready for it. I read a blog post about how Cloudflare Workers supported sending email without creating any accounts with MailChannels, but apparently that feature was deprecated. Codex wrote an implementation and when I tried it, it didn’t work! Once I realized that function had been deprecated, I had Codex rewrite it with Resend , after creating an account and getting all of the API keys and configuration set up. And it worked! Cloudflare Turnstile turning away robots and humans alike. When I emailed the user about the password reset, I sadly got a response that the Cloudflare Turnstile widget that I added to reduce the amount of spam and abuse was locking him out of the password reset feature. At that moment I realized that he was a robot and decided to not waste any more time on that clanker, until I was able to reproduce the issue myself. And I’m not a robot (at least I don’t think I am)! The issue boiled down to how the JavaScript was being loaded in an iframe. Or something, I dunno, AI fixed it. MCPs and CLI and Code Review! Codex does just as well or better than Claude Code at using tools like the CLI, and it also works pretty well with this new MCP that I found for controlling Google Chrome. I haven’t played around with this too much yet, but it could be pretty powerful as part of my workflow for updating web apps. Given a good agents.md file, Codex is also super powerful with CLI tools. I’ve been using it with wrangler (since I’ve mostly been developing on Cloudflare’s platform), and it’s a real time saver. Since it has access to my database schema, I can just ask it things about the data on my local or remote database, and it’ll make queries for me. I absolutely hate writing SQL queries so this is a lifesaver. It’s helped me debug things a lot faster than I could myself, since I can essentially generate queries in plain language. I’ve also been having Codex push changes to GitHub and create PRs with the GitHub CLI tool, so that Google Gemini can review the PR and see if it has any issues. Gemini occasionally finds some good issues with the code, which makes me feel better about making PRs. But it’ll also bring up the nittiest of picks if it can’t find anything else to comment on. Just like a real developer! It sometimes feels like I’m roleplaying as a software engineer at a large company, since it’s probably way too much process to create a PR just for me to accept it and merge it to main, when I can just commit directly to main anyway, and it’s not like anyone else is touching my codebase. But it is pretty fun to see Gemini comment on Codex’s code. I’d have Claude review it too except I stopped paying Anthropic. Other stuff Codex has this online feature where you can have it whip up a virtual environment and then make changes to your code without using your own computer. In theory this is kind of cool, but in practice it seemed to be a lot slower and harder to observe. Each time I wanted to add a turn to the conversation, it would have to whip up the virtual machine again, which took forever. One interesting thing about this hosted feature is that you can have it run up to 4x concurrently and then pick the best result. I found that when I tried this, the implementations were all pretty similar, which I guess is a good thing. I’m not sure if it’s worth the effort to try something 4 times just to have to read 4x the code to figure out which one is the best. Maybe you could have AI do that part too, so I don’t have to! Sorry, Earth! I tried testing ChatGPT’s other premium features too, but they didn’t work as well. For some reason, the deep research features of AI always seem to disappoint me. Maybe I’m just really good at researching things, but the AI always seem to give me a suboptimal result. Like if I ask for it to go to a page, and analyze all of the things on that page, it’ll go through maybe 50% and get bored and then finish and tell me it’s done. So I sort of consider AI to be like a lazy intern since you need to keep poking at it until it gives you what you want. The problem is that it takes about as much effort to babysit AI as it is to just do the thing yourself for a lot of tasks. So I guess it’s more about finding the tasks where AI is good (and at this point, re-evaluating that every month or so as AI gets better at things). Conclusion Overall, I like the way that Codex works outside of the box. Maybe it’s because I already had some context files set up (I just made some symlinks from Gemini.md and Claude.md to agents.md). But it feels like Codex is good at finding the right context to add in order to make reasonable changes. The changes I asked for weren’t groundbreaking or anything, but that’s probably like 99% of what needs to be done in code bases anyway. I’ll probably just let this free trial period time out (well, definitely since I added 5 business seats to my account). Then I’ll just have to see if Codex is still the top CLI AI agent at that point, or whether Anthropic recovers public trust, or maybe at that point Gemini 3 will be out and I’ll just play around with that. What a time to be alive! Meanwhile, Anime Nano is racking up features like there’s no tomorrow! P.S. I used Codex to help me add links and images to this blog post, which made it a lot easier and fun to write. I didn’t have it write any of the actual text though. All bad opinions are my own."

        "url": "/blog/2025/08/30/fun-with-wan-2-2-text-to-video-ai/",
        "content": "Your browser does not support the video tag. Get out the popcorn! This blog post is pretty much also a Youtube video, so if you want, you can just watch that instead! I recently got interested in text to video AI generators after reading a post about Wan 2.2. I hadn’t really been interested in them before because they all kind of sucked, and they either took too much VRAM or were proprietary ones that you couldn’t run locally like Veo or Sora, etc. But after looking at some of the videos that Wan 2.2 could generate, and seeing that it could run on some pretty standard hardware, I decided to look into it a bit more. Making a LoRA Whenever I use these AI image generators, I always like to make images of myself. Call it narcissism or whatever, but I think it’s really fun to throw myself into impossible and weird situations, or make paintings of myself as a Roman emperor or whatever. But to make the AI generate images that look even the least bit like me, I need to train a LoRA. I’ve done this already before with image generators like Stable Diffusion and, more recently, Flux. I used a tool called ai-toolkit to train the Flux LoRA on Runpod around a year ago. The quality of that image generation model was quite good, but I quickly forgot about it after I tried making a bunch of art for my Samsung Frame TV of myself which didn’t turn out that great. When researching ways to train a LoRA for Wan 2.2, I found that ai-toolkit already had support for it. I still had the config files and image dataset that I used to train the Flux model, so I figured it would be pretty easy to do the Wan 2.2 one too. The training took about 2 hours running on a 24GB VRAM GPU. I think it was an A5000. The interesting thing about training is that I didn’t need to use videos to train the video model, just images. After I loaded the LoRA into the default ComfyUI workflow for Wan 2.2, I was able to put myself into a bunch of different situations! Making Use of AI Videos The main issue that pops up with these video generation AI models is that the length of the videos has to be pretty short. The other problem is that it’s hard to have consistency with characters and scenes between clips, especially if you’re only using text as a prompt to generate the video. I’ve seen some really shitty videos that people were really proud of where the characters all look slightly different between scenes, and the vehicle they’re riding in changes wildly. Yet somehow they think their AI video is the next summer blockbuster. When Google’s Veo came out (I think it was Veo 3 or 4?) I saw a video that someone made that I thought was really clever. It was a fake news story about a synchronized swimming team of cats . I thought it was really smart because news stories consist of a bunch of short clips, and there wouldn’t really need to be a whole lot of consistency between the scenes. Any good artist knows to work within the constraints of whatever tools they’re using. I had a grand idea to create an 80s sitcom intro where every character was myself. You know how those videos always had someone looking at the camera and smiling? Or doing something wacky? Those scenes are always just a few seconds long, and they don’t really need to be consistent between each other since they usually super random anyway. So I started prompting. Here are a few examples that I really liked: Your browser does not support the video tag. I love the look on AI Hung's face I made this revolving door shot of myself and every time I see this video I’m just amazed by the look on my (my?) face. I mean, it doesn’t even look exactly like me, but I just think it’s so funny. Your browser does not support the video tag. Kid me I like how the AI de-aged me and the setting really does look like an 80s television show. Your browser does not support the video tag. Rolled up sleeves are cool! I had AI make me talk on a corded phone wearing a blazer with rolled up sleeves. It doesn’t get more 80s than this! I really liked how the lighting worked in this one, where you can see the shadow that was cast by the person as well as the cord of the phone itself! Your browser does not support the video tag. This is my real beach bod. I also made AI make me totally ripped at the beach. This actually closely resembles the training images that I fed to AI, so it hardly had to do any work at all to make this video. Your browser does not support the video tag. This is probably not sanitary. AI made me a doctor, which is something my parents can finally be proud of. Also I made myself eat a sandwich, which I thought was an original thought but then I realized that I stole it from Weird Al’s Like a Surgeon video (or is it Weird AI ?). I love this clip because the way he (I?) chews is so, so funny to me. Anyway, here’s the whole video if you want to watch it! The Music Since I wanted to make an 80s sitcom intro, and all 80s sitcom intros have banger music in them, I was thinking I could write a banger 80s sitcom intro hit myself. But then I realized that I’m not really good at writing songs or singing, and I just know how to play the trumpet, so I figured I’d just use AI for this, too. I’m honestly not a huge fan of AI music, as a musician myself. But I figured it would be appropriate given the context of the video being completely AI too. I wrote the lyrics to my song myself, and then I used Suno to generate the music. It took quite a few generations and prompting with styles to get a halfway decent song. I think that Suno doesn’t really know how to write a unique melody. My theory for this is that there’s probably some code or something embedded in the model that prevents Suno from using a copyrighted melody from a real song. So while it can come up with a decent chord progression and the instruments and vocals all sound real, the thing is so scared of getting sued that it won’t come up with a melody. Like, can you imagine if you asked Suno for a song and it just gave you Careless Whisper ? What’s Next? I make a lot of videos, whether that’s for Hoagie’s Youtube , or my Youtube , or my other Youtube for stupid stuff . I genuinely like making videos, so it’s sometimes weird to me that people who are making these AI videos think they will replace everyone who is currently involved in video production. Like I know that “AI replacing everyone” is a trope, but another popular trope is that people are complaining because AI is making art while they do repetitive boring tasks, where it should be the other way around. There have been a lot of complaints about AI slop too, whether that’s text slop or image slop or video slop. I mentioned before that I’ve seen so many cringey videos that people post thinking that they’ve made something incredible when it’s about the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I think the problem is that when you make art, it can suck or it can be good, and you eventually get a good understanding of which it is that you made while you are learning to make it. Usually people start off bad at it, and then they get better. Through this process, you develop taste and an understanding of what works and what doesn’t. The experience you get from putting time into it will shape your ability to filter and be your harshest critic, which helps you make better art that is worth sharing with people. When someone prompts an AI to make an image, and the image comes out sufficiently pleasing, they assume that there’s some sort of skill involved at the same level of making that image from scratch. I don’t think that’s the case, and while I’m not even anti-AI, I do think that there’s something to be said about learning a craft that you dont get by asking an AI to do it (obviously). I’m not saying that I’d never use AI as part of my usual workflow to make videos (in fact, I’ve used AI that cleans up audio for my poor microphone conditions before, and it turned out pretty good). But I think AI is still at the point that CGI in movies was some time in the late 90s. Li..."

        "url": "/blog/2025/08/01/31-days-with-claude-code-what-i-learned/",
        "content": "Claude Code - my coding companion for the past 31 days It’s been… one month since I purchased a Claude Pro subscription so I could try Claude Code instead of freeloading off of Google Gemini’s CLI. I thought I would take a look at the things I learned while vibe coding a few projects, and other uses that I found for Claude Code besides coding. If you missed it, be sure to check out my initial post about vibe coding , and the followup about how Claude Code was definitely better than Gemini (for now)! Context is King! So there’s a lot of talk about how prompt engineering is dead, and “context engineering” is the new hotness. That makes a lot of sense to me, as I ran into this issue constantly while using Claude Code, and to a lesser degree, with Gemini CLI. To understand context, let me first give you some… context. The way that LLMs work is that there is a pre-trained model with weights (the ‘P’ in ‘GPT’ stands for pre-trained). Most of these applications are next token predictors. So if I input: “Welcome to McDonald’s, how may I help”, the next token would probably be “you”. Before there was ChatGPT, there was the text completion API (does anyone remember using davinci-002 ?). But aside from the frozen model weights that the LLM is generating predictions from, any other context needs to come from you, the user. Most models have a specified knowledge cut-off date, which is basically the date of the most recent data used to train the model. So you can’t ask an LLM about anything newer unless it does a web search or something else to gain that context. An example of models and their knowledge cutoff dates (among other info) I like to think of Claude Code (or whatever coding agent I’m using) as a really smart software developer who also happens to have Anterograde Amnesia , like Drew Barrymore’s character in 50 First Dates (spoiler alert!). It can help you write an entire feature from scratch, and then completely forget who you are once its context has been wiped. From one session to the next, this tool will completely forget everything until you provide it with that context again somehow. For every session, Claude Code will literally need to look at whatever you’re asking it to work on and add it to the context before making more token predictions. Claude Code has a context window of like 200k tokens (see this documentation from Anthropic ), so whatever you’re working on needs to fit within that window, and every message you send to Claude Code will include all of the past context that you already sent. Claude Code might know how to reverse a list in Python, but it won’t know how to do that in your project until it loads the project into its context (why are you reversing lists in your project, anyway?). There are a few existing ways to help “prime” the context when you start working on things, so that CC doesn’t constantly have to search around to understand what you’re asking for. The most obvious one is the CLAUDE.md file which is added to the context of each conversation you have with Claude Code. You can put things like instructions for doing common tasks, or explain the organization of which files go where. A common one would be to say where the log file is, so Claude Code can use the log files to read error messages. If you see Claude Code running a bunch of bash commands to grep files every time you ask it to do something, you might benefit from adding it to the CLAUDE.md file. Of course, it’s a balancing act as you don’t want to stick too much junk in there if it’s not relevant, either! When your context window gets too big, Claude Code will attempt to compress it, which I typically don’t like. I find that too many details are lost and it’s better to just start over from scratch by using the /clear command which essentially wipes all of the memory from the previous context. I think there’s been some studies done about how much worse these LLMs perform when the context window approaches its limit. Another thing that I’ve found is that context can get poisoned pretty easily. What I mean by that is you ask Claude Code to do something, and it does it the wrong way. Then you correct it and it undoes what it did, and does it the right way. Even though you corrected it, you still end up using that incorrect implementation on each and every turn of your conversation, because it’s in the history. To avoid this, you can hit esc twice, and just rephrase the thing you said that Claude Code misunderstood. This can save tokens in your context window and also keep the context from getting poisoned. One more thing I do to keep the context small (and therefore my token usage smaller) is to /clear the context whenever I’m done doing a task, especially if the next one is unrelated to the thing I just did. The way Claude Code works, all of your previous conversation history for your current session is used for your next message. So if I had Claude Code fix a bug around authentication, and then I wanted to have it work on image caching next, it doesn’t make any sense to keep sending the history about authentication in the next messages. There is some sort of token caching going on that I believe saves you usage, but I think that longer contexts are by definition less effective anyway. Claude Code Codes I don’t want to repeat myself too much with what I wrote in my previous blog post, but here’s a sample of the coding I did this month with Claude Code: I added automated testing with playwright to Animenano Optimized Animenano RSS feed parsing by caching etag/last-modified headers Wrote a script to sync the remote Animenano Cloudflare D1 database for testing locally Added some tools to my LiveKit AI agent that I was messing around with, like a Japanese phrase guessing game Vibe coded search on my blog on a plane! ( I actually made a video for this! ) Set up staticman for comments on my blog! Changed the comment form on my blog from a hard reload to an AJAX update! Wrote a script to scrape comments from my old blog posts on archive.org to replenish my missing comments (due to having a static blog)! Started working on an AI powered DJ that picks from my local music collection and adds occasional personalized commentary with TTS Added some features to a project that automatically creates localizations for Youtube video titles/descriptions and captions Wrote a script to convert Final Cut Pro titles to SRT subtitles (for Youtube) Wrote a Windmill script to evaluate coffee deals on Slickdeals rss and send a Slack message if they meet my parameters (light/medium roast, cost per oz, whole bean, etc) Out of all of these things, I think Claude Code does the best when it’s working on a small, single file script. This makes sense because as we discussed earlier, context is very important. If Claude Code can store the entire script in memory, it won’t make false assumptions (hopefully!) about how things work. And if it doesn’t make those false assumptions, we can assume it will write correct code for any changes. I think it does do this most of the time. This is such a powerful use case that I really want to use more often. For example, I had an idea to add comments to my static blog, so I asked Claude Code how I should do it. Once we decided on staticman, Claude Code implemented it. Then I had an idea to get my missing comments on my blog back using the Internet Archive (I nuked them when I went from a Wordpress blog to a static site). So I had Claude Code write a script to scrape them from it. I’m sure I could’ve done this myself, but I’m also sure I’d be too lazy to sit down and figure out the endpoints and all of the glue code to make it work. With Claude Code, I just asked it to pound away at the problem until I had the solution, while I looked at Reddit. As an individual contributor for my entire software engineering career, I finally understood what it was like to be a manager! Another use case was that when I make Youtube videos for my dog , I hard code captions in E..."

        "content": "Claude Code - my new best friend! (I spent a lot of time on this image, btw) Previously on my blog, I wrote about vibe coding and how I was experimenting with Google CLI, the free agentic AI thing that runs in your command line. I talked about how cool it was, but also how I was too cheap to try anything that cost money. After repeatedly hearing about how good Claude Code was, I decided to scrounge up the last few dollars I had in my vast money bin and spent $20 on Claude Pro. So was it worth it? Heck yeah it was! Claude Code is my new best friend! What is Claude Code? Claude Code is Anthropic’s official CLI tool that brings Claude’s coding capabilities directly to your terminal. It’s a lot like the Google Gemini CLI that I talked about before, but it actually has brains and doesn’t get stuck in an infinite loop constantly for no reason. Previously, when I tried using the Gemini CLI, it would mostly hit rate limits, switch to the flash version of the model, and generally be bad at doing things. Even with the degraded quality, I still found some use for it, though. But I knew that if I wanted to be a true Vibe Coder, I’d have to upgrade. Claude Code uses Claude Sonnet 4 which is apparently really good at code. So far I’ve used it to: Code: I added automated testing with playwright to Animenano Optimized Animenano RSS feed parsing by caching etag/last-modified headers Wrote a script to sync the remote Animenano Cloudflare D1 database for testing locally Added some tools to my LiveKit AI agent that I was messing around with, like a Japanese phrase guessing game Vibe coded search on my blog on a plane! ( I actually made a video for this! ) Set up staticman for comments on my blog! Changed the comment form on my blog from a hard reload to an AJAX update! Wrote a script to scrape comments from my blog posts on archive.org to replenish my missing comments! Other: Documentation for my various side projects, instead of leaving the readme blank Set up wireguard on my opnsense, Claude Code helped me debug why I couldn’t access the network until it worked! Added documentation on how I set up mdns and nginx on a home server to serve stuff on the network, and added some more hosts The “Other” category is honestly a really cool unlock for me personally. I have a bunch of home servers that do random stuff like run cron jobs of scripts for automation and other really random things. I usually just write one-off implementations based on quick searches of how to do things (like setting up mdns and nginx to redirect example.local domains to 10.0.0.111:8000 for example). Inevitably, I’ll forget how I set something up (like when I set up a launchd daemon thing) and it becomes this tech debt where it becomes really difficult to fix or change anything if something breaks or I need to set it up again a different way. With Claude Code, I can just have it read the files and figure out how things work, then write a README.md that describes in plain language how it’s set up, how to use it, and how to modify it. Claude Code is incredible for side projects and these sorts of things where you naturally don’t put the same amount of rigor into documentation as you would for professional work. It takes the boring parts of fun projects and automates them, so you have more time to start even more side projects that may or may not ever be finished! There’s a Plan For HOW MUCH? I’ve been seeing a lot of posts online about how people are YOLOing their wallets and buying the $200 a month Claude Max plan , which includes 20x the amount of requests that you can make with the Pro plan (which I’m currently on). I suppose that if I was using Claude Code for my job, and it was on a super large codebase, that might make some sense. But honestly, it seems a bit excessive. For an experienced software engineer, coding is probably like 10% of what you actually do, and the rest is reading code and planning what to do. I guess Claude can help with that too, but it just seems like the guys who are running 8 subagents simultaneously and racking up the Claude Code tokens could really just learn to git gud at software engineering. Or as the kids would say, Skill Issue! They’re obviously just karma farming because who actually does that!? I guess one additional bonus of that ridiculous MAX plan is that you have access to the Opus 4 model, which may or may not be named after that penguin from the 80s. I already feel like I can accomplish pretty much whatever using Sonnet, but I guess that if I hit too many roadblocks, it might be interesting to at least try Opus. I do think I made a pretty good decision paying for the $20 plan as I rarely hit the rate limit anyway, and I’ve been using this tool called ccusage to see how much I’d be paying if I was using the pay-as-you-go style of token based API usage. My Claude Code usage statistics from ccusage showing token usage and costs. Not bad for $20 a month! This image doesn’t completely reflect my usage because it’s divided between like 3 different computers, and the tool only shows usage for the computer it’s running on. And I’m too lazy to go run it on all of them right now to see how much I actually used. On top of that, I think the Claude Code Github Actions stuff uses your Pro Plan quota, so that’s not showing up in the numbers either. I plan on continuing to use Claude Code and paying for the subscription for now. I started it on July 1st and I’ve already gotten my money’s worth for the month. To be honest, I have a suspicion based on the token usage image above that this price is heavily subsidized, kinda like how Uber and Lyft rides used to be super cheap. Though with those things, you’d have to pay a person, and with Claude, you just need to pay to run a server. Hopefully servers get cheaper or more efficient, but even so, it’s hard to believe that this much utility can come at such a low price. Maybe I should be more bullish about AI. I should probably report back in a month or so to see if I run out of things to use CC on, or if I just keep using it as frequently as I am now. For now though, I’m totally bought into the hype. Claude Code forever! BTW Also, I’m still using this AI stuff to help me write my blog. None of the actual words were written using AI, but I did use it to help me be extremely lazy. For example, the image I made at the top of this blog (which was sorta generated with AI but also hand edited) was plopped into the root directory of my Jekyll repo. I then told AI to put it in the right directory, and make a link and a caption to it. I did the same with the screenshot of the ccusage tool, and I also told the AI to resize it since it was kinda big. It used a command line tool and got it to 150kb from 650kb. Interestingly, I tried asking it to add some alt text to the images in this post for accessibility. It did an okay job at first but I kept nudging it, and now the images are a lot more accessible. I also had it add some links within the post, which I could totally do myself, but why should I do it if AI can do it for me? To me, that’s the whole point of AI. I enjoy writing blog posts and getting my thoughts out there, but wrangling images and formatting captions brings me no joy; it’s just friction. AI is helping me be creative and express myself, without taking away the soul of the process of creation, which is the way it should be. I’m sure I’ll think of more ways to use AI, but for now this is getting me really excited about the possibilities!"

        "content": "Vibe Coding Origins As generative AI has gotten better in the past months/years, I’ve been trusting it more to do stuff that I’d normally only trust myself to do. Earlier this year I started yet another refactor of my web app, Anime Nano , since I wanted to get it off of the $10 a month DigitalOcean host I was using. I decided to try using Cloudflare since it’s “serverless” and seems to be able to handle a buttload of traffic (which Anime Nano will never see). I usually reserve Anime Nano refactors (at this point they’re a pretty regular occurrence, as I’ve refactored it from Rails to Django , and using different databases and hosts, and deployment technologies like Chef and Docker ) for technologies that I’m somewhat familiar with. Or technologies that I want to learn. At this point, though, I have a lot less patience for learning stuff that I’m unfamiliar with. I decided to try and let AI do most of the heavy lifting, and successfully used Google Gemini (I think it might’ve been 2.0 Pro) in January to move the most basic functionality of Anime Nano to Cloudflare. I was hoping to stay on the free tier, but I think the CPU time limits were being killed by my cron jobs for fetching blog posts. So I ended up signing up for the $5 a month plan for workers, which isn’t really that bad. There’s still plenty of capacity left for any other online experiments I want to run, so that’s a bonus. I was thinking of hosting my personal blog on Cloudflare Workers at some point, but GitHub Pages is free and it works just fine. It is a bit annoying writing my blog posts in Markdown and using Jekyll though. Anyway, this blog post is supposed to be about vibe coding! I did pretty much vibe code the MVP of Anime Nano in AI Studio , though it was kind of a pain because I had to copy and paste stuff and make sure that it worked. And if it didn’t I had to really yell at the AI until it did what I wanted it to do. Still, I found it was a success, and I relaunched the web app in Next.js , a technology that I still don’t really understand all that well! Enter Gemini CLI Oooh ASCII art! Fast forward to this week, and Google announced the release of Gemini CLI , which is supposed to have a huge amount of free API calls on Gemini 2.5 Pro. Now, before you start complaining that it’s not as good as Claude or whatever, you need to understand that I’m extremely cheap. So I don’t care if Claude Sonnet 4 or Haiku 10 or Iambic Pentameter 40 is better at coding. If it costs money then I’m a lot less likely to even try it out. And Google has been at the forefront of supplying AI for free. They have the most generous free tiers out of any company, and I’m taking advantage of this gravy train until it runs out! Gemini CLI Capabilities So anyway, I’ve been really impressed by Gemini CLI. I did try out OpenAI’s Codex CLI a bit when it first came out, but I didn’t really get it at the time. Like who wants to run AI in the command line anyway? But it clicked when I installed Gemini CLI and the insiders version of Gemini Code Assist for VS Code. The most annoying thing about chat bots is that they give you a response, then they wait for another command. You can’t really ask them to do anything super meaningful, because they always just give a response and need more input. They’re mostly set up for back and forth with a human. Sure, they can give you a wrong response and hallucinate if you ask for something really complicated, but most of the time I’m interested in a correct response for something that is difficult to research or find out. If it was easy I’d just Google it, like “How do I keep cheese from sliding off my pizza?” (Of course the answer is glue) The whole CLI naming is honestly kind of misleading. I think the only reason they released it as a CLI tool is so normal people wouldn’t install it and kill their servers (developers did end up killing the servers anyway though). Gemini CLI is really more of an AI agent chat interface that can take action on your command line if you want it to. But you could also just interact with it in the way that most people do with ChatGPT. The difference is that it can decide to use tools, and use multiple thinking steps to get to the answer that you want. This is more in line with what I want my AI chat to do anyway. On top of this, the multi step planning and tool use makes this CLI tool a LOT better at vibe coding. The first thing I asked it to do was to add a few tools to this AI voice agent thing I’ve been playing around with using LiveKit . I had previously vibe coded this thing using the Gemini Live API (seeing a pattern here?) and wrote a tool that let it calculate how old my puppy is. So I could fire it up and then ask it how old Hoagie is. And I can tell it to do it in a New Zealand accent because those accents are so funny! With the CLI, I asked it to write a tool to find some recent news headlines that the Voice AI could then use to read back to me. It searched the web for some free news APIs, one of which gave me headlines from 2022. Not exactly news. But I kept telling it to try again, and it kept searching until it found something that was actually kinda suitable. I probably could’ve done this myself too, but it’s honestly a pain to read API documentation, make the fetch call, parse JSON, etc. The AI can do it pretty well since it’s all structured data. If it runs into an error, it just tries again, unlike me! Thus, you can ask for a thing, and just wait until the AI gives up or completes its mission! The Pace of AI This was really an “aha” moment for me as I realized that AI had gotten even better than my previous mental model was currently giving it credit for. Of course, this has happened lots of times in the past few years. When ChatGPT first came out it was incredible. But I quickly found the edge cases and the limitations of it. Then a few months would pass and AI would be able to do even more. I’d be super impressed but then run into cases where it still couldn’t do the cool things I wanted it to. The pace of how fast AI is getting better is both alarming and exciting to me. Like, yeah, everything is gonna get blown up by it. The environment, jobs, everything. The internet did the same thing, though. We can now buy pet food online! I wonder how people would have calculated the electricity and water usage of the early internet back in the day, especially given how inefficient those processors were. Anime Nano Speed Coding So back to Anime Nano. I left the rewrite in a good enough state, so it would keep parsing anime blogs and showing them to people. I am honestly not sure how many people actually visit it (I know how many visitors there are, but I think they’re mostly bots). It’s essentially just a point of pride for me to keep it going. Like, it could only have 2 users and I’d probably still keep the domain up. Unless all of the current anime bloggers just stopped blogging, I guess. But suprisingly, there’s still quite a few bloggers (or blogs) still active. (I’m trying to be more active too!) There are still a lot of features missing from Anime Nano that existed in the 2006 version. I’m not sure what this says about my programming ability because I literally coded the first version in like 3 weeks, 20 years ago. It’s like that scene in Iron Man where the guy yells at his employees because Tony Stark made his suit that they couldn’t recreate in a cave using rocks and stuff. Except I’m both the bad employees and Tony Stark! Of course, I had more hunger and drive back then, and I didn’t have to take care of a whole household at the time, either. Wow I’m really getting off topic every time I start a paragraph. I should try sticking to the plot here. After seeing what Gemini CLI could do with my stupid AI voice agent, I decided to turn it on my still MVP Anime Nano project. In the past day or two, I’ve (the AI) implemented user login, a user settings page with image upload, a blog settings page with image upload, and recreated t..."

        "content": "Like washing mud off a car with water... We recently moved (I guess it’s been like half a year now) to a house that only had “round” (short) toilets, so I lost the use of my butt-cleaning Toto C200 Washlet . I’ve been super busy with home projects and I only just got to the point where I could rectify (pun intended) this situation. I probably could’ve just attached a way too big bidet toilet seat to a way too small toilet, but whatever. I ended up buying a Toto Drake (meme incoming) toilet because everyone says it’s like the best toilet ever. I never really thought about comparison shopping toilets (or even shopping for a toilet) before, but I figured I might as well get the best one. So what if I bought the toilet just to make this joke? Installing The Toilet I guess this doesn’t really need to be in this post but I might as well include it for the sake of completeness. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on replacing toilets, since that’s how you learn anything these days. Once I watched about 5 videos and poisoned the YouTube algorithm for my account permanently (now YouTube thinks I’m a toilet guy), I was confident enough to DIY it. I’ve also been working out so I figured a heavy toilet was nothing to my huge muscles. The toilet install went fine, and I only needed to go to the hardware store twice (once for some PTFE tape to stop a small leak and another time to get a larger adjustable wrench to remove the thing that was leaking so I could apply the tape). I felt pretty good about my powers of DIY and for my next project I’ll probably try to build a new house in my backyard or something. Actually, maybe I’ll start smaller than that. Installing The Seat Once the toilet worked and didn’t leak, it was finally time for me to install the bidet seat that I had been missing for months. I pulled it out of a random box I had in my office and tried installing it, but when I tried to push the seat onto the toilet baseplate, it wouldn’t stick. It would just slide back out the front. Now, I did find a metal thing in the same box and thought it might be part of the toilet, but I couldn’t see a logical way to fit it. Plus it was only one piece so it couldn’t possibly have had anything to do with the seat, right? I thought this might be related to the toilet. I could still use the toilet and toilet seat, but if I scooted forward on the seat I could accidentally make it fly off of the toilet, which could lead to some embarrassing 911 calls. Getting “Support” The next day I started a chat with Toto customer service, and they did some troubleshooting with me. I sent them a photo of the bottom of the toilet seat and the baseplate and answered some questions. They determined that I needed to send the toilet seat in for repair, and it would cost $175 to fix it. That didn’t seem like the worst deal since these toilet seats are usually pretty expensive, and I bought mine refurbished (from Amazon Warehouse) anyway. (Don’t worry, I washed it before I used it and it didn’t seem to have too much poop on it when I got it!) I had a nagging feeling that the baseplate was really the problem though. I did some internet searching and found some pictures of the baseplate with some metal brackets in them, similar to the one that I had discounted before. I also found this forum post where someone basically had the same exact problem, because Toto’s official picture in their manual doesn’t really show those metal brackets, and they don’t even appear in the exploded view of the baseplate. I put the single metal bracket that I had into the baseplate and the toilet seat locked in place! At least half of the seat did. This diagram is very unhelpful. Toto customer service was also unhelpful. I went back to customer support and mentioned that I sent them a pic and they misdiagnosed my issue, almost causing me to pay $175 for a repair I didn’t need. They didn’t seem too ashamed of how bad of a job they did, and mentioned that they don’t sell those little metal brackets, and I’d have to buy a whole stinkin’ baseplate just to get a little metal piece. The C200 Washlet I have is no longer in production (I think) so the parts for it are pretty hard to find, or expensive. I didn’t want to spend upwards of $50 just to sit on my toilet, so I decided to try and 3D print the missing part and see if that would work instead. The worst case scenario would be that I could 3D print it and it would just snap off or something. You Wouldn’t Download a Toilet Seat Replacement Part! I did try and see if anyone had this exact same problem, and 3D printed the part and made it available online, but unfortunately that’s a pretty niche thing to do. So I used some of my skills in making that Talkboy thing and remade the part from the one piece that I had. I can't believe just tracing this thing in Pixelmator actually worked! I took a photo of the part with my phone and then I traced it with a pen tool in Pixelmator Pro (apparently they’re part of Apple now). Then I exported that SVG and sized it properly in Tinkercad . I used my digital calipers to measure all of the dimensions and then I just made some more cubes and added them to the SVG shape I made. Then I used Ultimaker Cura to convert that .obj file into gcode so my Ender 3 could print it. This seems like a lot of steps, but I think it probably took me less than an hour of actual work. It only took like 8 minutes to print. It probably would’ve gone faster if I hadn’t been staring at it the whole time. The Moment of Truth! You can probably tell the real one from the 3D printed one if you squint hard enough The time had finally come to see if my hard work would pay off, or if it was just a massive waste of time. I took the 3D printed part off of my printer and compared it to the original. “A perfect replica,” I thought in my head. Because I have a huge ego. I raced to the bathroom, this time for a reason that didn’t involve explosive diarrhea, and tried installing the toilet seat again, with the original part on one side, and the 3D printed part (which miraculously fit) on the other. I slide the toilet seat into the baseplate, and it made a satistying click sound as it locked into place. It worked! I thought to myself, “dang, I should 3D print stuff more often!” This is probably the last photo of my toilet I'll post to my blog. Probably. That’s Pretty Much It. I haven’t written a blog post in a while so I thought why not document this. I also shared the file of the bracket in case anyone else ever loses that part and needs a new one (and also has a 3D printer). You can find it at Tinkercad . (Maybe I’ll share it on some other places, too) I’m mainly just happy that it all worked and now I get to shoot warm water onto my butt whenever I want. Hopefully someone else finds this blog post useful!"

        "content": "Was this book written for me? I recently found out about a book called: “ Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet ” by Taylor Lorenz. As someone who self identifies as extemely online, I needed to see what this book was about. It ended up catapulting me on a journey through my own blog and online history. It All Began With The “Blog” As someone who grew up with technology, I feel like an expert, but also an old man. I started blogging in 2002 , which is basically internet pre-history. As an elder Millenial I don’t really “get” TikTok, but I do pretend to know the latest slang, no cap. The book starts with the blogging revolution as the first major technology that put power into users’ hands and away from traditional media. As an aside, I had a webpage as early as 1994 or 1995, when Geocities came out. I somehow remember that my url was “/Hollywood/Hills/7923” (this was literally 30 years ago) and as it turns out, it was archived by archive.org! ! (I actually have a backup on my computer so I wouldn’t have lost it either way) You can follow the link to my old website if you want but this is the best part. I’d argue that Geocities really started this trend, while blogging software made it even more accessible to the average person. Because if I as a 6th grader could do it, I’m pretty sure anyone else could have. Lorenz goes quickly through the rise of blogging, pointing out that blogs were beating newspapers in the speed and depth of their reporting. Who wanted to wait for the paper to be delivered (!) to their doorstep to know what happened the previous day? As blogs showed their superiority to traditional media, people started latching onto it. And as bloggers gained more and more credibility, their potential to earn a living became greater, through display ads, affiliate marketing, and influencer marketing. The first section of the book was particularly nostalgic for me, as I remember the hype for blogs reaching a high point, and their subsequent fall from relevance. At the height of blog-mania, there were even news stories about how dangerous blogging had become . I recall that around 2006, I dreamed of creating a blog empire and getting rich from the traffic. That obviously didn’t happen, but I didn’t do too badly either. Then Social Media Came Of course, practically no one actually blogs anymore. I’m pretty sure you get a free blog when you sign up for AARP membership. Social media came and created stronger links between individuals than a blogroll ever could. It was through social media that a random kid in suburban Florida could become a tastemaker. While I only ever wanted to use Facebook for keeping in touch with my friends, I do remember using my Twitter account to expand my reach among the technorati. Or at least trying. The closest I got was hobnobbing with celebs at SXSW . Here, Lorenz describes the proto-celebrities who were famous for being famous. People like Tila Tequila and Julia Allison (who I honestly never followed at the time) fit this bill long before Kim Kardashian did. One of the most interesting things to me about the book was the recurring theme of a new technology slowly gaining mainstream acceptance, and with it, the ability to monetize. At first, bloggers merely got free stuff for making posts (which is as far as I ever got, though I did get a LOT of anime ). Next, they would demand payment for promoting a particular product. After that, they might get a cut of sale through an affiliate link. None of these strategies were planned by the platforms that enabled them, but hey, people like making money. This played out again and again, through platforms like Instagram, which was absolutely opposed to advertising for a very long time, to YouTube, to Tumblr, to TikTok and Snapchat. On a personal note, I really enjoyed reading these stories as someone who has tried to make money online in a bunch of different ways. For example, I made my dog into an influencer and had quite a few sponsorship deals. See this ad for Keystone Light , or this one for some dog toy . I was also thrust into the YouTube Partner Program after finding some viral success with my video about Trombone Champ . When I say I’m Extremely Online , I mean it! But Not For Me While the first half or so of the book really resonated with me, the back half was not as engaging. It documented a bunch of more recent “celebrities” who, as an oldie, I am just not familiar with. I have no interest in “internet tea” between one dumbass prank Youtuber and another, or a TikToker famous for inventing a dance. I did, however, find it interesting that people started pushing back against the highly produced perfect Instagram content for highly produced (to look less produced) relatable Instagram content. Also, I am fucking scared to death of going on TikTok. This might just be my oldness talking, but I suspect that in 5 years or so, we’re going to look back at all of the TikTok challenges and memes with the same kind of cringe that we do for “ AWESOMESAUCE BBQ! EPIC FAIL !” language. Because cringe is timeless, and one day cringe will come for us all, even Gen Z. As Grandpa Simpson famously put it: I used to be with ‘it’, but then they changed what ‘it’ was. Now what I’m with isn’t ‘it’ anymore and what’s ‘it’ seems weird and scary. It’ll happen to you! Crap, I just realized that I seem even older now that I’m quoting a show that’s been on the air for… 34 YEARS!? Back To My Blog I will say, however, that this book really brought back my interest in the earlier days of the internet, and my blog. There was even a section where the author described an event where the minor internet celebrity, “Grumpy Cat,” made an appearance at SXSW. THE VERY SAME EVENT WHERE THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN: R.I.P. Grumpy Cat, a.k.a. Tardar Sauce! After reading about the timelines that I personally participated in, I had to take a stroll down memory lane though my blog. Yes, the very same one you’re reading. After moving it for the Nth time , I didn’t really check the older posts for broken images or links. Since it’s a holiday break, and I don’t have anything better to do, I went through every single post, from 2002 to today, and fixed up all of the issues that I could. I fixed formatting, weird image sizing and alignment issues, and went through every link to see if it had died. I replaced all of the dead links with archive.org links, if they were available. And I made sure that the archive.org link was timestamped to the closest date to the actual blog post, so you could get the best context possible for what I was thinking at the time. As a side note, archive.org is amazing, and I’m definitely going to donate some money to it so it can keep doing its thing. As I read my old blog posts, I couldn’t help but feel nostalgic for the person I used to be. I started out super naive, and gradually became more and more mature. By which I mean my fart apps have been getting more and more complex. Anyway, I might expand on this in a future post, as this one is getting long and I’m quickly getting away from the scope of this book review. This book has definitely reignited my interest in blogging, and generally sharing more of my experiences in writing. Now that Twitter (I mean X) is a true cesspool, I might retreat back to my true roots. Overall, I liked this book. The beginning was great, but the second half didn’t really hold my interest. Even so, I’d recommend giving it a read if, like me, you are EXTREMELY ONLINE !"

        "content": "It's not a Christmas album without wintery wonderland album art! This year, I wanted to make something special to go along with my annual holiday cards. Much like a washed up singer, I decided to produce a new holiday album. And since 2023 has been the year of AI, I decided to revisit my voice cloning projects in the process. Choosing a Playlist I went through all of the Christmas songs on my computer, and started to figure out what songs I wanted “myself” to sing. I figured I’d choose a variety of styles and artists, like a Christmas playlist except I’m singing all of the songs. Here’s the track list I ended up using: All I Want For Christmas Is You Here Comes Santa Claus Feliz Navidad I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas Last Christmas Silver Bells It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas Santa Baby Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree Sleigh Ride Let it Snow I used an app called “ Ultimate Vocal Remover ” which ultimately removed the vocals from all of these songs. I didn’t select all of the songs and process them all at once, because there were some I ran into issues with. The app does a really great job of isolating vocal tracks from musical backing tracks. But it doesn’t distinguish between the lead singer and backup singers. It also sometimes mistakes saxophones and other human-y sounds for voices and includes them in the vocal tracks. As far as I can tell, there isn’t really a way to remove lead vocals from backing vocals. When I run a combined track through the voice cloner, the model doesn’t know which vocal to follow and it can sound pretty warbly and weird. Which is hilarious, so I kept it in “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” which I couldn’t just omit from my Christmas album! If you’re curious about the voice cloning software, I have a blog post and video on the process. (Although this time I ended up using RVC instead of so-vits-svc, but the process was pretty much the same) There were a few songs that have a main singer and backup singers that sing at mostly different times. In these songs, I just deleted the backup vocal sections and would only keep the main vocal to clone it. Then I had to reinsert the original backup vocals so it sounded like I was singing with some old timey choruses. After getting the vocals ready, it was a pretty simple task to recombine the backing track with my voice cloned vocals and export it to an mp3. Making Album Art No Christmas album is complete without an awesome album cover! I was too lazy to go take a photo of myself in holiday clothes, and I had already trained a LoRA for making images of myself in Stable Diffusion XL ( which is also a video ). I guess I didn’t write a blog post about it yet though. There are AI image generators out there that do a pretty good job with composition. I think the Bing image creator (which is actually just OpenAI’s DALL·E 3) makes nicer images than Stable Diffusion out of the box. I’m guessing it’s the same for ones like Midjourney too. The problem with those generators is that it can’t make an image of a guy who looks like me (unless I got incredibly lucky and they happened to make my twin). I’ve been refining my process of creating AI images lately. Instead of just throwing a prompt in the text box and hoping for the best, I’ve been trying to get more consistent results by using ControlNet models. The method I used to make the album art was thus: I created a bunch of album cover images in Bing, according to the prompt: Festive holiday album cover art of hung truong, dressed in a suit and a red santa claus hat, in front of a microphone. he is looking directly at the camera there is a realistic snowman behind him and the setting is a nighttime winter wonderland with trees and mountains in the background, and aurora borealis in the sky There is freshly fallen snow on his hat and shoulders. he is wearing glasses. award winning photography. I made a bunch of images and tweaked the prompt until I got something that I liked. It didn’t matter that the guy doesn’t look like me. That’s what the next step is for. The generated image that I used for the basis of my album cover. I then loaded the image above into ComfyUI and ran it through a ControlNet model to extract the depth from the image. So any generated image would follow the same depth map, more or less. There are ways to make the depth map have a stronger or weaker effect on the final image, so I tweaked that too. Then I could make a bunch of images that, while all different, would have a similar depth map, which in practice means that the image will be of a guy who looks like me, in that same pose, leaning into a microphone, wearing a santa hat in front of a snowman and probably some trees. Here’s a look at some of the images I had to choose from. A bunch of potential album covers. Publishing My Work I thought it would be funny to upload my AI Christmas album on to Soundcloud, so that when I finally got a hit tweet I could point people to it. So I created a new account and uploaded my entire album. I then immediately got a bunch of emails that the songs were flagged for copyright issues (even though they’re quite different). I don't get why Soundcloud couldn't figure out that it was fair use parody but oh well. I decided I’d have to take matters into my own hands and just host the album myself. I found an open source html5 music player thing and used it as a base for the interactive page: Hung For the Holidays Also, I realized that there’s already a Christmas album called “Hung For the Holidays” that was released by that William Hung guy from American Idol. What are the odds!? Conclusion I’m glad that I could end my 2023 by making a very AI generated project. It was fun coming up with the track list and doing some editing to make sure the songs sounded okay (for the most part). I probably put way too much time into this stupid project that probably only a few people will actually listen to. It’s a pretty niche joke and I’m pretty sure only people who already know what I sound like would find it amusing. The best part is that I can troll my wife by including some of my tracks in my regular Christmas playlist, so you can never be sure if it’ll be the original version or “Hung’s Version.” Anyway, have a happy holiday 2023! Here’s to more interesting AI projects in 2024!"

        "content": "The Talkboy Ultra is So Bad Note: This blog post is based on a YouTube video I made, which you can watch in the embed, but it also has some stuff that’s not in the video, so read the stuff I wrote below! So while I was learning about AI voice cloning technology to make myself sing better (and to make Kanye sing stupid songs), I got an idea into my head that I couldn’t let go of. I was reminicing about the original Talkboy Deluxe from the movie Home Alone 2 ( and the subsequent commercial that played on kids tv for years after ), and how it was supposed to change your voice but really it just kinda slowed it down. I realized that I could make the dream of the Talkboy come true, and do it with real life hardware. So here’s the story of how I made the Talkboy Ultra, which it turns out is a pretty fun toy. Building The Dream I knew that I wanted the Talkboy to be a real device, not just some app on a phone. Phone apps are cool, but there’s just something about single-purpose devices that hit different. They’re more fun and there’s something about pressing a button that’s designed just for a single purpose. I was hoping that I could run everything locally on a device, but the voice AI inference requires too much memory, so I went with a client-server approach. I started with a Raspberry Pi Zero W as the base, and added a USB audio card with input and output . I connected a lavalier microphone and tested recording and playback. The recording worked fine but when I plugged in an unamplified speaker, the audio was way too quiet. I decided that instead of figuring out how to amplify an audio signal, I would just go with a USB powered speaker . With this setup, I could successfully record and playback my voice (after writing some Python code to do that). The Talkboy Ultra's Guts (minus a few things). From this foundation, I added a few push buttons for the recording and playback controls. I also wanted the device to work without having to plug it in to a power source (for portability) so I added a 1000 mAh Lithium-ion battery pack and a TP4056 Charging Module with micro usb input to charge the battery. I also added a MT3608 DC-DC Step Up Boost Power Converter so I could power the Raspberry Pi with it (since the voltage coming out of the battery is 3.7v). Finally, I added a 1602 LCD display to show the state of the device, either the currently selected voice or the processing state. And to be able to control the power supply to the toy, I added an on/off switch . I soldered the components together and amazingly they worked the first time! A 3D render of the device's case. I couldn’t just let the device sit in the cardboard box that I was using for prototyping, so I also designed and 3D printed a case for it. I started with a blocky box just to test how the components like the buttons could fit in the holes, then I refined the case to have some smooth, rounded edges. I also added a microphone enclosure thing and a handle so I could hold it with one hand, just like the original! I used TinkerCad for this, which works pretty well once you learn the controls. Software Of course, I worked on some software in order to make the toy actually do stuff. I wrote everything in Python since it’s pretty portable and runs well on both my laptop and my Raspberry Pi. On the Raspberry Pi, I wrote some code to handle button presses for recording, playback and voice selection. I also had to write some code to make HTTP requests between the Raspberry Pi and my laptop (web server). The basic workflow is: I press and hold the record button, and say whatever it is I want to hear in a different voice. When I release the button, the recording stops and the Talkboy sends the audio file to my web server along with the voice model to use. The LCD switches from the currently selected voice to “Processing….” The web server receives the audio file and runs the inference on it, then sends the response with the changed voice file back to the Talkboy. The LCD switches back to the voice display to show that it’s done processing. Then when I hit the green button again I can hear the changed voice. I already had some voice models and the script to infer audio from one voice to another set up since I used it in my previous project on AI voice cloning. I just had to write a simple Flask web server to respond to the HTTP requests, run the inference script, and then send the file back to the Talkboy (so simple). The delay between finishing the recording and being ready to play back the voice depends on how long the recording is. I would say that the total latency is probably around 5-15 seconds for a typical short recording, which isn’t too bad. I could probably optimize the speed by streaming audio to and from the web server but that’s more complicated and I’m not really willing to do that just for a stupid gag project like this. Examples! So I guess I should include some examples of the voice changer here. My previous blog post had some audio examples of me singing some songs, but here’s some before and after clips of the audio I used in the Youtube video. Arnold’s quote from Kindergarten Cop: Me: Your browser does not support the audio element. Arnold: Your browser does not support the audio element. Picard ordering Taco Bell: Me: Your browser does not support the audio element. Picard: Your browser does not support the audio element. Picard ordering Taco Bell: Me: Your browser does not support the audio element. Picard: Your browser does not support the audio element. Homer Simpson having a midnight snack: Me: Your browser does not support the audio element. Picard: Your browser does not support the audio element. Training Just as an aside, from the above models, I trained the Arnold Schwartzenegger and Patrick Stewart voices (both from audio that I found from audio book clips). The Simpsons ones that I used in the video were downloaded. I didn’t train for a super large number of steps so that might explain why the Simpsons ones sound very close to the real deal, whereas the other ones are just okay. Closing Thoughts I had a lot of fun with this project. It really ended up combining a bunch of my interests, including hardware hacking, software (both on an embedded device and server), and utilizing some state of the art AI models too! I also got to 3D print a case that’s much more complicated than anything else I’ve made myself. It was fun coming up with this challenge and then solving all of the problems that came with it, including fitting everything in the case, and lining up all of the components like the screen and buttons. While I think it would be really interesting to see this device hit the mainstream market, I don’t think it will happen any time soon. For one thing, the licensing of real voices would probably be an issue. Plus the hardware to run the inference on a device doesn’t exist as far as I know. I think you might be able to do it on an iPhone if you shrank the model, but that wouldn’t be nearly as fun as using a dedicated device. I’m hoping that I’m wrong though, and that a 30th anniversary Talkboy makes its way to the toy stores, complete with the latest in AI tech!"

        "content": "Two legendary directors doing the weather report Note: This blog post is based on a YouTube video I made, which you can watch in the embed, but it also has some stuff that’s not in the video, so read the stuff I wrote below! I was recently stuck on a really long, 6 hour flight. Luckily, I had an internet connection the whole time, and I was testing out some nifty AR Glasses , so I watched a lot of YouTube. I remembered seeing a video about AI voice clone cover songs, where someone will take the voice of a known artist, and then make them sing a song by another artist (e.g. Kanye West singing “Call Me Maybe”), or they create a whole new original song for the artist (e.g. Drake singing an original called “Heart on My Sleeve” ). Since I was stuck on the plane, and I had the privacy to watch whatever I wanted without my seatmates judging me for binging on a bunch of AI cover songs, I just fell deep into the rabbit hole of listening to a bunch of Kanye covers. The quality really varied. Some of the songs were unlistenable due to weird glitches in the voice. But some sounded pretty convincing. The good ones still didn’t really pass as real, but I think that with some post-processing and maybe an actual sound engineer on the case, they could be great. I was on a plane to Hawaii, and while I also had some fun doing Hawaii stuff, I also spent some of the time learning about voice cloning and trying to train some voice models myself. Blue Skies and Golden Sunshine The first voice that I wanted to try to clone was David Lynch’s. You might not think that his voice would be my first choice, so let me explain. Maybe a year ago, I started watching these David Lynch weather reports that he was doing daily. I think the joke is that the weather in L.A. is pretty much the same all the time. But I would watch it every day, and it was pretty soothing in a pandemic world to have something that was consistent. I had some ideas on automating his weather report, which would either take pieces of his other reports, and stitch them together to make a new one (based on the actual weather of the day, of course). I looked at some AI libraries that could find someone’s face and make their lips move with an audio file . The results were actually pretty creepy, which is appropriate for David Lynch. But I figured he might get mad at me and I don’t want David Lynch to be mad at me. Plus I kind of got sidetracked and busy and I didn’t have time to finish that project. David Lynch stopped his weather reports abruptly some time in December, and I started missing them. One of the reasons I liked listening to his reports is that he has a really funny way of talking. He talks like an old timey newsreel, and pronounces words a certain way. Like for “day” he says it like “dee.” I figured that if I could clone his voice, I could do my own version of his weather report. And if I could get the pronunciations correct, then it could seem like he was back doing them (in an Asian person’s body). I was also thinking about integrating deepfake technology into my version of the weather reports, but I haven’t figured that part out yet. Anyway, I trained a voice clone model of David Lynch using the audio from his weather reports. I used a library called “so-vits-svc-fork” to do this, and I trained it on Kaggle since I don’t have a GPU at the moment. When I tried to actually infer my voice to the David Lynch voice model, it sounded really funny. I ended up posting a video of it anyway though , and I shared it in the David Lynch subreddit. The folks there thought it was a pretty convincing impression, but I was still not happy with the results. Eventually, while playing with the settings, I figured out that I wanted to manually transpose and set the “–no-auto-predict-f0” flag. I also experimented with some other f0 prediction methods which made the synthesized voice sound better. I still haven’t made another weather report but I’m pretty sure I could nail it with the updated settings. I also understand now why David Lynch stopped, because it’s kind of a lot of work and I can’t imagine doing it every day. I Think I’m a Clone Now So after the success of the David Lynch voice model, I figured I would clone my own voice. Because sometimes I wonder how it would sound if I could actually sing “My Heart Will Go On” exactly like Celine Dion (currently I’m at about 90%). I took a bunch of audio from my previous YouTube video on Trombone Champ , which was about 10 minutes. Coincidentally, 10 minutes is around the suggested amount of audio to use for voice cloning. I trained a model on just me speaking, but the model ended up underperforming when it came to singing. There were some weird glitches when moving between notes, which were probably just pitches that weren’t included in the sample data. I ended up recording about 6 minutes of myself singing some various hits from the 80s and 90s, and added that to the audio data for training. The resulting model sings pretty well. Here are some audio samples in case you are interested. My Heart Will Go On: Your browser does not support the audio element. I Believe I Can Fly Your browser does not support the audio element. After trying it out for myself, I’m convinced that AI voice cloning will be a pretty big deal, not just for these novelty use cases, but also for actual music production. Sure, the results aren’t perfect right now, but you can believe that as technology gets better and better, artists are going to want to use this to gain a competitive edge, just like autotune or any other kind of technology that was introduced in the past. I thought up a few use cases where this technology can be used, but I’m sure there are others: Multi-Lingual Media Currently, the only artists who can have hits in multiple languages are the ones who are bilingual. For exmample, Shakira has version of “Hips Don’t Lie” in Spanish and English because she knows both. But if I was an American artist who wanted greater reach in Japan, I could have a voice double singing with Japanese lyrics to one of my songs, then clone my voice into the Japanese track. It would then sound like I’m singing in Japanese. If artists can reach more fans, that’s probably a positive for them. Music is universal, and artists like Bad Bunny are proving that you don’t need to speak a language to be popular to the native speakers, but it certainly helps if you understand what the person is actually singing about. Enhanced Accessibility I’ve been making more YouTube videos lately, and when I do, I always try to make them accessible by adding captions. This helps people who have hearing disabilities enjoy my videos. I usually only caption in English, but those captions can then be auto-translated by Google, which also expands my viewership to people who don’t speak English. To make my videos even more accessible, I could translate the captions, then produce audio using TTS. This would result in a voice that is speaking the captions of my video in the other langauge. Finally, I can apply my voice clone to the TTS audio to make it sound like I’m speaking the other language. I tried this in my voice clone video, but I had to slow down the actual video because I talk fast, and I guess German just uses more/longer words. Voice Clone Collabs Right now these voice clone AI covers are just working in some murky legal territory, because it’s a bunch of enthusiasts having fun and creating things. At some point, the ones who are good at this will probably end up collaborating with artists to make music together. Not all artists will do this, but Grimes has already stated that she’ll split earnings if anyone uses her voice . Selling Voice Rights Bob Dylan recently sold his entire music catalog for a pretty big sum. As artists are getting older and ready to retire, I could see them offering rights to use their voice as well. I mean, if they’re not going to use it, they might as well let someone else! Imagine how much the right..."

        "content": "It's everyone's favorite new trombone music rythm game! Note: this blog post is more or less adapted from a script I used to make my YouTube video on this subject. So if you want to watch the video, I’ve embedded it here! Or if you like reading more, then go ahead and read my post below! (I can’t stand the recent trend of making content that’s video-only so I refuse to not make a blog post out of this video!) I just got this new game called “Trombone Champ” which is like Guitar Hero but with a trombone. It’s honestly one of the most refreshing new games I’ve seen, not only because it’s fun and has a good sense of humor, but also because it sort of reinvigorates the music game genre. I love that part of the game is subtly recognizing that you can’t really sound good on a trombone, which is hilarious. I did find that the control scheme could be improved, since you’re expected to play with a mouse (and optionally keyboard keys). So I set out to turn my soprano trombone into a real video game controller for Trombone Champ! Why a Trombone Controller? A screenshot of the game After I got the game, I played all the levels and had a lot of fun, but I felt like something was missing. I think that driving games are more fun when you use a steering wheel, and flight simulators are more fun when you use a flight stick. Can you imagine how boring Duck Hunt would be if you had to use the regular NES controller to play it? So I decided to make a trombone controller for Trombone Champ. Luckily, I have a love of novelty instruments, and I never throw anything away, so I just happened to have a Jupiter soprano trombone in my closet . I think I origially bought it because it would be funny to use during basketball games (I used to play in the band in college). Making a Fake Mouse So since I have an actual trombone, all I need now is to connect my trombone to the computer, so I can play the game with it. I did some searching and found a library that can turn a esp32 microcontroller into a bluetooth mouse . This is perfect because then all I need to is connect some sensors to my trombone and have those move the mouse and click its buttons. Then I can connect the mouse to my computer and play the game. I decided to use a Firebeetle ESP32 microcontroller because I had one lying around from a previous project, and because it comes with a connector to plug in a lithium ion battery. This is nice because I’ll be able to play the game completely wirelessly instead of needing to plug in to usb for power. Adding Sensors So now I have two different problems to solve. I’ll call these the “blow problem” and the “slide problem.” Let’s start with the blow problem. I didn’t want to just add a button to my trombone to play a sound, because that’s not how wind instruments work. I want to actually blow into something. So I looked for different ways to measure air flow , and it turns out these types of sensors are really expensive and didn’t make sense for my project. I ended up finding this neat air pressure sensor that also has a port in it to attach a tube. My idea was that I could attach a tube to the trombone mouthpiece and measure the air pressure difference when I blew into it, directly into the sensor. This was actually a terrible idea though, because the tubing would need to go through the entire trombone and then come out of the bell, and it would really impede the movement of the slide. I ended up putting the whole sensor in the bell and then sealing the entire instrument with some saran wrap. When it’s on it has a red LED which I think gives it a pretty nice cyberpunk feel. Then I measured the ambient air pressure inside the trombone. In in my room it happens to be around 1011 hPa. When I blow into the horn, it causes the air pressure to go up, and I can register a click. When the air pressure goes back down, I can release it. The air sensor in my trombone's bell So with my blow problem a thing of the past, let’s move on to the slide problem. In the game, you’re supposed to use a mouse to simulate the slide of a trombone. But there are a lot of problems with this. The slide on a trombone is fixed, so if you go to first position, you hit the end of the trombone. You can’t go to negative positions, but your mouse doesn’t just stop when you hit the end of the screen. Plus on the instrument you can use muscle memory and look at the bell to figure out what note you’re gonna hit. I looked at a bunch of different ways to solve the problem of using the actual trombone slide as a controller for the game’s slide. There are various distance sensors: lidar, sonar, time of flight, you could also probably use a gyroscope and accelerometer to figure out what direction the slide is going. I think I saw someone use a wiimote’s accelerometer to make a 3d air mouse once. To be honest, I just wanted to get started on this project quickly, so I ordered the cheapest time of flight sensor on Amazon that had next day shipping . I attached it to the bell of the trombone and put a piece of cardboard on it that it can use to bounce a laser on to detect how far the laser is away from the initial position. When I actually hooked this up to my microcontroller, it ended up giving some pretty inaccurate readings but I figured I could hook it up to my mouse software and see what happens. The distance sensor attached to the bell Results This weekend I made a Trombone Champ controller out of a real (soprano) trombone! I'll have a video out shortly about the process, but for now, enjoy this video of me absolutely failing our national anthem with my new device! cc @HolyWowStudios pic.twitter.com/SvPoxfk6GV — Hung Truong (@hungtruong) September 25, 2022 I’ve linked my tweet of an attempt at the Star Spangled Banner above, but if you don’t want to watch a video, I’ll tell you that it did not work well! I think the time-of-flight sensor I got was faulty, as it didn’t go past 100mm with any degree of accuracy, but is rated for 2000mm. But to be honest, I’m really happy with the way this project turned out. The blow sensor works a lot better than I expected it to, as I was initially worried it wouldn’t be able to register the notes quickly enough. I also learned a lot about simulating a bluetooth mouse which I could probably use in future projects. I’m happy to share this project even though it isn’t perfect yet because this kind of prototyping is really an iterative process anyway. I also thought it was interesting how the slightly air tight seal on the trombone bell works. When you normally play an instrument, you have some back pressure, but air is also going through. I would say that I probably use more air blowing into the trombone without making any noise than I do when I’m actually playing it. This could lead to me getting tired pretty quickly, so I might adjust the seal on the horn a bit more so I don’t have to blow as hard. As far as next steps go, I’ve already purchased a few new sensors to try out, one is an acoustic distance detector , and the other is a more expensive time of flight sensor from adafruit . I’ll probably update this blog post when I try the new sensors, so look for an update below at some point! Update September 27, 2022 So I ended up getting the new distance sensors! I had a problem getting the acoustic sensor working (it looks like it doesn’t play well with other i2c devices at the same time) but the time-of-flight sensor from Adafruit is working a lot better. Here’s a video where I actually get a C in Oh Canada. Some quick impressions on the current state of Trombone Champ Controller v2: I am going to need to seal the bell a bit better than with the current plastic wrap solution I have now. There’s quite a bit of air leak (as I had predicted before). Playing a 1 minute song is pretty easy but playing the longer ones leaves me pretty lightheaded by the end. When playing a regular trumpet, I don’t really use that much air, so getting too much oxygen is not an issue. But I am probably s..."

        "content": "Ron Swanson as Ron Weasley! For the past few months or so, I’ve been noticing a lot of news stories about DALL·E 2 , an AI image generator that uses GANs to create images from prompts. It was private for quite a while, and there were some similar, less powerful projects that were open. I played around with them a bit but I was waiting for a general release. I ended up getting into the DALL·E 2 beta a few weeks ago and last week I saw news that there was a new release of another project called Stable Diffusion , so I installed it on my MacBook. The results really blew me away! Getting it working Prompt: photo from behind an asian software engineer typing a keyboard with many monitors in front of him, studio lighting bokeh It wasn’t too bad getting the release of Stable Diffusion working on my Mac as I just went through some of the steps on this site I found . There were some gotchas, like needing to install Rust to compile something and maybe a few files to change around, but for the most part it worked pretty quickly. I could probably have written down the steps but I’m sure it will be a lot more simple when they add more specific support for Apple Silicon. Right now it takes about 3 minutes to create an image with my M2 MacBook Air, which is kind of slow. I ended up using Google Collab which lets you use their GPUs for free. The next day though, I found I was rate limited. So I moved over to Kaggle which at least tells you what your GPU limits are, and they seem pretty reasonable (like 30 hours a week at least). The Kaggle notebook has been my main workflow so far because it’s quite fast (like 10 times faster than my Mac) and the short feedback loop really helps with coming up with prompts. Prompt Engineering Prompt: cat vs a british shorthair cat sitting in front of a giant cheeseburger in the african savannah, fujifilm x-t2 35mm golden hour So What is a prompt anyway? A prompt is what you type in to the image generator to describe what you want it to create for you. If you say you want a picture of a cat, it’ll likely come up with a pretty good cat. But if you want, you can also describe the cat in more detail to get a more specific image. You could add the breed, for example, or say it’s a robot cat, or make it sit on a park bench. There are so many possibilities of what kind of cat to show that the prompt ends up being incredibly important to get what you want. There’s been a lot of research done on prompt engineering. Some of it feels like a shortcut, by asking for an image in the style of a famous artist. You can also just describe the medium of the image, like a water color or illustration. I’ve noticed people on Reddit adding words like “trending on artstation” which I guess is a way to suggest that the image is aesthetically pleasing to a majority of people. You can also say something was painted badly, which is kind of hilarious. Prompt: a really ugly painting of a woman Part of the fun of playing around with these tools is that they’re so new that it’s possible to find words that can create certain images that no one else knows about. For me, it brings back the feeling of being on the early internet, when not everything was indexed by Google to the point where there were no hidden gems. Someone should bring back “Cool Site of the Day” but for prompts! Different Techniques I’ve learned that there are a few different techniques to make images, and I’m learning quite a few more. The simplest one is text to image, which I just described. The way I understand it is that basically you start with some random noise, and then two AIs work to alter the noise to turn it into the image you want by iterating changes and measuring how closely the image matches your description. That’s probably really simplified and maybe wrong but whatever, I’m not an AI engineer. Another way to create images is to start with a base image, and also feed the AI a prompt. Since you can choose the starting image (instead of just random noise), there’s a better chance that the image converges to something that resembles your input image. This gives you quite a bit more control over the final image’s general shape, composition, etc. You could feed it stick figures or a photo from your phone. I’ve seen people turn stick drawings into D&amp;D character portraits using this technique. I tried this technique out by using a photo of my dog, Sodapop, sitting in the grass. The picture is pretty good, but it’s not award winning or anything. I fed the text “a watercolor illustration of a black and white cardigan corgi sitting in the middle of a green flowery meadow in front of an orange ball, masterpiece, big cute eyes”. I didn’t start with that, but I kept changing it to try and get an image that I wanted. Prompt: Sodapop vs Watercolorpop I also played around with different strengths and amounts of iterations. I found that if I used too many iterations, the image didn’t really resemble Sodapop anymore. He’s a black and white Corgi, which is less common, so there’s probably more of a bias towards the sable and white ones. One thing I learned is that it’s better to just generate a huge number of images and then pick the ones you like. You can save the random seed value and use it to refine the image further as well. There were a lot of really terrible looking corgi watercolor images which my computer is full of now. But there were also some fairly good ones too! The power with this AI is that it’s pretty cheap to just make more images until you get what you want. One of many rejected generations Future Techniques There is another technique I tried recently where someone tried to create a bigger image (right now most video cards can only do 512x512 and that’s what the model is trained on) by creating an image, upscaling it and then running the image to image process on 9 square parts of the upscaled image. When I tried this, I found that it added weird artifacts into each square piece. It was recursively trying to fit the whole prompt into each square. My prompt was a garden, and it basically tried to add a garden into each subsquare of the image. This could have been due to a current bug where the random seed on Mac doesn’t really work, but I don’t have the hardware to try it on a non-Mac right now. I’ve had a lot more fun playing around with this image generation stuff than I have in a long time with technology, so I ordered a new graphics card so I can iterate on things more quickly on my own infrastructure. There’s something really magical about using a model file that’s only a few gigabytes to basically create any image you can think of. If my internet connection ever goes down for the count, this could be my main source of entertainment. There’s a bunch of other things I want to try. There’s a technique called “Textual Inversion” where you can sort of re-train (but not really) the model to use a personalized word. I could do this with Sodapop so I stop getting Pembroke Corgis when I want my Corgi. I was also wondering if I could use it with pictures of myself, since Stable Diffusion seems to work really well with making images with well known celebrities in them. When I first saw this technology I figured it would be good for creating blog post images (which obviously it was for this post). I’m also envisioning things like services for creating customized watercolor portraits for your dog, or custom fantasy avatars for a person. I think people have just barely scratched the surface here so hopefully there’s a lot more interesting stuff coming up."

        "content": "Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past few days, you’ve heard of this game online called Wordle. It’s been growing like crazy and the New York Times even wrote a profile on the creator . If you know me, you know I like automating things, so it should be no surprise that I decided to automate playing the game. Here’s a blog post on how I did it. WTF is a Wordle? I guess I could start out by explaining what Wordle is, in case you’re reading this blog without knowing what it is, and if you are, why not just play it first ? Anyway, the fun part of Wordle is that there isn’t really a way to cheat. You try to guess a five letter word, and the game gives you feedback for each letter in the word you guessed. Either the letter doesn’t exist at all in the target word, the letter exists in the word but not in that position, or the letter does exist in the word in that position. Letters can repeat, e.g. “silly,” and you get 6 guesses before you lose (I think). I’ve actually never lost, because 6 is a pretty good number of guesses unless you get really unlucky. If you think about it mathematically, 6 tries times 5 letters means you could theoretically narrow down 25 letters before your last guess. But that’s assuming you only use unique letters and there are words you can actually use to guess those letters (the game doesn’t allow non-words). There is the problem of narrowing the word down to maybe 1 letter difference but there’s a bunch of words that end in the same letters, e.g. frank drank crank spank etc. If you get the last three letters then you still need to narrow down what the front ones are, which you could do exploratively, but you can also just keep trying likely words. Anyway, if it isn’t obvious yet, I probably enjoy the metagame of Wordle more than playing the game itself. Solving Wordle So how do you go about automating a game like Wordle? I started by trying to inspect the network requests going back and forth between the web frontend and the backend. Suprisingly, there are no network requests made because the whole game is just a javascript file, and (I think) a hash that determines what the word of the day is. The whole game is just a javascript file that you download and run. So looking at the javascript file, I saw a bunch of hard to read code (because javacript), and a few interesting arrays. The first had a bunch of pretty normal looking words. The other had words that looked real, but were less common. My guess is that there are words that can actually be used for the game because a normal person would know them, but another list of words that are valid guesses (because the game doesn’t let you put nonsense in). So I decided to take the first list of words and use it as my “dictionary” of possible choices, rather than just use a linux dictionary of all the obscure words that exist. The two word lists, possible answers on top and valid obscure words on bottom. As far as playing the game, you have to start somewhere. I started out by keeping a list of all possible answers (copied from the source), and picking a random one. Once that happens, you get hints for which letters to keep trying and which to discard. The game code actually has three values for letter results: “present,” “absent,” and “correct.” From these, the basic algorithm to remove words from the possible choices is (for each letter): If present, remove all words that have that letter in that specific position (for example if the word is “farts” and you guess “after,” the first ‘a’ would be present, but never in the first position). Also, remove all words that do not have that letter present in any positions. If absent, remove all words that have that letter in any position. If correct, remove all words that do not have that letter in that position. That’s basically it, and doing this will quickly whittle down the list of possible choices. There are some other optimizations that I tried out but I don’t think they have much of a significant effect on how quickly the bot can guess the right answer. For example, I made a sorted list of the most common letters used in English words and had the bot prefer words with the most common letters first, to narrow down results faster. It might be possible to improve this by calculating probabilities or something down to the individual word level but I’m way too lazy (for now) to try that. A Mac App I ended up writing a Mac app to run the solver because I knew I could use a webview and make it evaluate some javascript commands. I wrote a few functions for doing things like keying in letters and hitting enter, and reading the results using the “shadow dom” which sounds a little bit like forbidden magic but whatever. I had to throw in some manual sleep() calls because it would go too fast if I didn’t. Also it looks more like a real person is playing if there’s a slight delay in entering letters. Here’s what the Mac app looks like solving the puzzle from Jan 8, 2021: I’ve found that watching my bot play the game is more interesting to me than playing the actual game. Since it’s somewhat randomized, it’s fun to see what combinations of words the app tries, and how quickly it can narrow down its results. I log the list of potential answers after each round, and it’s fun to see how the app “thinks.” One More Thing: The Bot, But IRL iDraw: the second most advanced pen plotter known to me. Making an app to automate something is cool, but I felt like something was still missing. I recently bought a mechanical pen plotter (which I should probably make another blog post about) for making generative art , so I thought it would be fun to program the pen plotter to play the game on my iPad using my Apple Pencil. The pen plotter is basically a robot that has an arm and can raise and lower a pen (or Apple Pencil) and move it along an x-y axis. I bought an off-brand version of the Axidraw , which has a similar but different board. I tried using the axidraw python library to control the iDraw. It sort of works, but there are some weird differences. For example, the pen down movement seems to bring the pen up instead of down, so everything is reversed. Also the scaling is off, so if I want to move the pen 1 inch, it seems to move it by 2 centimeters instead. I just worked around these issues because I saved a lot of money by buying the cheaper one (it was about half the price). I wrote a script in Python to take one command line argument which is the word to guess, and hardcoded positions for each letter on the iPad screen. I was thinking I could use some kind of computer vision, AI library to detect positions and translate them for the plotter, but that’s also too much work. Maybe for a different project. The Mac app runs as before, except that it runs the local Python script when guessing, and waits for the script to complete before trying the next guess. I’m pretty happy with this setup, even though it’s a pain in the ass to get it working, because I have to set the pen height and line the iPad up with the robot correctly. I did end up getting the measurements right for the keyboard keys on the first try, which was cool. It’s just that if the iPad slides on the table then everything is off. I made a YouTube video that describes this more, and embellished some stuff for entertainment. So if you want to watch that, you can see it here , (and don’t forget to obliterate that like and subscribe button)! I also pushed the solver specific code to Github. It’s pretty ugly but if you’re interested in how it works, you can check it out. I probably should’ve used regular expressions in hindsight instead of blowing up strings into arrays but I figured that with the word list at around 2,300 words, it really doesn’t matter how inefficient I am! https://github.com/hungtruong/Wordle-Bot"

        "url": "/blog/2021/05/02/zwift-clone-swiftui-combine/",
        "content": "I recently switched teams at Amazon to one that is using SwiftUI and Combine, so I finally have a good excuse to learn the two. I am somewhat familiar with Functional Reactive Programming from using RxSwift at Lyft, but I’ve only really dabbled a bit with SwiftUI. I decided to spend some time last weekend (and this weekend) rewriting most of my Zwift clone app to use SwiftUI and Combine, and here’s some of the stuff I learned along the way. Moving to Combine When I originally wrote the Zswift app, I didn’t really spend too much time on making sure the data model or architecture was the cleanest or anything. It’s really more of a hodgepodge of explorations and trying to get stuff to just work. Because of this, I probably violated a bunch of best practices. I had a “Workout” object that stored all of the different information that is needed to model a workout, but I also threw a bunch of logic and functions in there that probably didn’t make sense. For example, the Workout had info on each segment of the workout, along with the duration and amount of power for the segment. As the workout progressed, I would store the elapsed time as well as a bunch of other state variables like the current segment and other variables like time in current segment that I used to drive the UI. Since I kept a bunch of variables to keep track of state, it’s possible that some of them would get out of sync with each other, and that would cause bugs. I think I had a bunch of off-by-one errors where I would reach the end of an index and crash or the time within a segment would be off by 1 so I’d be at 2:01/2:00 as far as progress went. Those kind of bugs. In moving to Combine, my goal was to have the state of the workout flow from the one thing about the workout that actually changes: the elapsed time. The elapsed time literally decides which segment I’m in, how long I’ve been working out (duh), how long I’ve been in the current segment, how hard I should be pedaling, etc. I ended up creating a separate class to keep track of the state of the workout, and just use the workout as a static definition of the workout. I could’ve done this before migrating to use Combine, but like I said, it was working and I didn’t feel the need to refactor. In my current setup, the WorkoutManager has a @Published variable that keeps track of the elapsed time, and then I create a bunch of other publishers based on that one. I also have publishers that combine (imagine that) with other publishers. For example, I have a publisher called “timeInCurrentSegmentPublisher” that publishes the amount of time that I’ve been in the current segment. I combine this publisher with the “currentSegmentPublisher” which gives me the current segment, and use this to calculate the percentage progress for the current segment. I have to combine the two because each publisher only gives me one thing. I weighed the benefits of creating publishers with multiple tuples of values, but in most cases it didn’t make sense, and I think it goes against the concept of making the streams composable, but I did end up making one for currentSegmentPublisher since it calculates the current segment and the current segment’s index at the same time anyway. Even as I’m writing about it now, I’m not sure if the better way is to create two different publishers since it’s kinda clunky to grab the desired value from the tuple. Anyway, the result here is that my Workout object doesn’t have any more state at all. I could make it a struct but there’s some SwiftUI requirement for my Workout to be a class if I want to use it in a Modal view (which the workout detail is set up as) so for now I’ll just leave it as-is. I could also create a view model if I really wanted the Workout object to be a struct. I’m sure I could optimize the Combine publishers even more but since they’re working now I’ll just leave them. SwiftUI An example of the live SwiftUI previews that update automatically The general opinion that I see from others about SwiftUI is that the more people use it, the more they like it, and that it really forces you to rethink how you define interfaces. I heard this a million times but until you actually play around with it in a non-trivial example I feel like it’s hard to really understand it. The gist is that SwiftUI is a declarative way to define your UIs instead of an Imperative way. The difference can seem subtle until you start doing stuff. What it means is that instead of telling the computer how to do something, you just tell it what you want. If that’s confusing then yeah, actually it is confusing. I guess to put it another way, in UIKit you can define views as objects, give them properties, add them to a parent view and then set some constraints on them. In this imperative example, it’s up to you to define every step to the computer to tell it what to do, and hope that your interface matches what you were thinking. In a declarative syntax, you can describe what you want, and add some modifiers to it if you need to have more control over the actual output. From there, you also define state variables or observed objects that the SwiftUI view will use to actually come up with the completed interface. Imagine that you want to show a list of dog breeds. In an imperative system you need to set up the collection view controller, fill out your functions for “cellAtIndex” and “didSelectCellAtIndex” etc, and supply the cells. In a declarative system you can say “I want a list of ‘DogViews’ that use the ‘Dog’ model” and define a “NavigationLink” to define what happens when you tap on the cell. The interesting part to me was that the SwiftUI view is an immutable struct, so you can’t modify the view as you would a UIView when states change. Of course your view can respond to changes in the data model, but all of those states need to be determined at compile time rather than runtime. One of the best parts about SwiftUI is how the “live” previews work. They aren’t exactly real time, but fast enough that the feedback loop between writing UI code and seeing the result is very tight. In the past I’ve had to write code to update a UI (or use Interface Builder), then build and run, and go to the part of the app where the UI I changed was. This could mean it would be a few seconds or minutes before I saw whether the change I just wrote actually worked. In SwiftUI you make a change and once you’re done writing it, the preview window will show it. The system isn’t perfect, of course, as sometimes it can’t compile and you need to reenable the live preview. But it’s really the best tradeoff between the WYSIWYG style of Interface Builder and the readability of programmatic view code. I’m sure the tools will improve in the future, and I’m quite certain that this ease of previewing code will be one of the factors that will motivate people to switch to SwiftUI. The Workout View I modeled my original interface after the Zwift app. In the Zwift app, you can see the workout represented as a bunch of rectangles representing segments that get taller when the target power is higher. The width is determined by the length of the segment. I basically copied this and implemented it with a UIStackView and percentage constraints. I thought it was pretty cool but one thing that bothered me is the warmup and cooldown segments. Those have a starting value and ending value that are different (warmups start lower and end higher). I didn’t want to spend too much time drawing the start of the rectangle to be lower than the end (plus it wouldn’t technically be a rectangle at that point) so I just used the “lower” value and set them as flat rectangles. I decided to practice some custom drawing in SwiftUi to properly draw the warmup and cooldown segments and I’m pretty happy with the result. The view is drawn by taking the desired start and end heights and width, and drawing a path with it. I used “path.addArc” to get a nice rounded corner effect, though it isn’t perfect. I al..."

        "url": "/blog/2020/05/12/reverse-engineering-quibi/",
        "content": "I’ve had a lot of free time in the past few weeks so I decided to spend some of it working on side projects. I really enjoy reverse engineering apps, so I decided to take a look at Quibi. Quibi (short for “Quick Bites”) is a video streaming app/service that has a bunch of shows that are short. The idea is that you can sit on a bus ride and consume an episode or two, depending on how long your commute is. One of the constraints of the platform is that you can only watch these videos on a phone or tablet with the app installed. Since everyone is stuck indoors for a while this constraint is kinda stupid and most people would probably like to watch their videos on their big tv rather than huddle around a phone, which is what Emily and I had to do to watch that stupid viral show about the terrible wife with the golden arm . Anyway, I had an idea to write a tvOS app that would work with Quibi, so you could watch your terrible shows on your tv. Here’s what I learned trying to reverse engineer the Quibi app. Setting up Charles Get out of my head Charles! The first rule of reverse engineering club is that you should probably install Charles proxy on your computer, and point your phone to it. This lets you inspect network requests and figure out the API for an app. Depending on how stringent the app’s security settings are, you can either learn a lot, or very little from Charles. The way Charles works is that you basically route all of your traffic from your iPhone to your computer. You need to install a certificate on your phone and trust it, so that your phone thinks that it’s going through a secure connection when it’s really getting owned. But since you’re self-owning, it’s generally okay. I’m not going to do a full tutorial on how to do this because you can just read the docs. You can also buy a version of Charles that runs directly on your phone. I did this, but I also find it easier to work with on my computer, so I used the free version that stops working every 30 minutes. I should probably buy the full version. Anyway, once you get the proxy working on your phone and add the proper domains to the allowed list, you should start seeing your network requests and responses pop up in Charles after firing up the app and doing stuff. It turns out (luckily for me) that Quibi doesn’t utilize certificate pinning (at least at the time I’m writing this article). Cert pinning is a way to prevent snooping of network requests by embedding a certificate (or maybe a hash of it or a public key) to be trusted into the actual app binary. This means that adding the additional Charles certificate won’t work because the app won’t accept it. The process of pinning is kind of a pain in the ass, which is why a lot of companies don’t do it. Because Quibi doesn’t use cert pinning, that means I can observe all of the requests and responses that the app sends and receives, which makes it a lot easier to reverse engineer! Authentication This is what the Quibi OAuth request/response look like with the private stuff removed I won’t go too much into the way that Quibi does authentication, as it appears to be a pretty basic implementation of OAuth 2.0, using auth0 as a service provider. It doesn’t appear to use a client secret key, as I’m able to just replay the request with my username, password, client id and other parameters and get a valid access token back. One interesting thing to note here is how short the token expiration is, just 2700 seconds, or 45 minutes. Once authentication happens, the access token is used in subsequent requests as the authorization bearer header tokens. I didn’t bother to set up a new app with authentication because I wanted to get to the meat of the app, and started taking a look at how the app’s requests and responses were structured, which brings us to… Protocol Buffers! I’ll be honest, I was initially pretty annoyed when I read the line, content-type: application/protobuf in Charles. That’s because protocol buffers are pretty annoying to work with unless you actually have access to the .proto files that were used to generate the schema for the response. Luckily, I have experience working with protobufs (as the cool kids call them) because we started implementing them at Lyft last year. As a primer, protocol buffers basically define requests and responses, and their types, in a way that can be shared between servers, clients, etc. It does so in a way that reduces the amount of redundancy in the data. So instead of looking at a JSON file that labels each key/value pair for each item in an array, you just see the values, and the keys (and their types) are essentially encoded outside of the format itself. That’s probably a gross simplification of protobufs, but that’s basically how I understand their functionality in lay person terms. So getting back to Quibi, I was seeing calls to endpoints like https://qlient-api.quibi.com/quibi.qlient.api.home.Home/GetHomeCards with a bunch of wacky characters, urls, and names and descriptions of tv shows. Looking at the raw text gave me an idea of what was being returned, but there was also a lot of data that I couldn’t see because it was encoded as a protobuf response. I found a tool written by someone named Alba Mendez called protobuf-inspector which allows you to visualize the values in a protobuf response. Once I threw the response into this tool, it started to make a lot more sense. Here, I could see that the home cards were displaying structured information for each of the cards in the app. The hierarchy seemed to be a card with series info, a mp4 preview link, and then info about that particular episode. There were also some values that didn’t really seem useful, like “&lt;varint&gt; = 1” which could’ve meant anything, like a bool value or episode number. The tool has a way to set up object definitions, so that when you run it again, you see the key names and types that you defined. This is helpful if you’re trying to guess what something is and you want to compare it against a few different objects. Here’s what the response looked like once I tried defining some of the keys: This makes the response look a bit more logical. I really guessed some of these, so if someone from Quibi actually reads this maybe you can confirm. I probably spent more time on this than I needed, because really all I want is to show a list of shows and maybe even start watching a show. To waste even more time, I ended up defining this response in a .proto file, compiled it into Swift with swift-protobuf and got a Swift app to parse the response into real Swift structs! Here is the proto definition: The generated proto code in Swift is pretty big, so I’ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to run it through swift-protobuf. Here’s what it looks like running in the debugger in my app: So with what I have written about so far, I could actually write a functioning Quibi client that supports logging in, making a request to get a list of tv show cards, and displays them, with a “live” preview, just like the real app. That doesn’t matter much unless you can actually watch the show, though. HLS and Video Streaming I apologize for the anti-climactic finale of this blog post, but this is where I got stuck. Before I tried reverse engineering this app, I pretty much knew nothing about video streaming. When looking at the chain of requests that the app makes, it appears that the app hits an endpoint called “GetPlaybackInfo” and sends a payload of series id, season #, and episode # along with a mystery UUID that I haven’t seen anywhere else in the app requests/responses, then receives a link to a “license” url, a few links to .m3u8 resources and some cookies for accessing those .m3u8 resources. Then the app makes a request to the license url with some form encoded data and receives some other encoded data back. Finally, the app makes a request to one of the .m3u8 files and starts streaming the video. I did some research and it looks like a .m..."

        "content": "I haven’t been working as much on my workout app since it’s been good enough for me to use as a replacement for Zwift with the most recent changes I wrote about. I got a new iPhone so I had to build and install the app on my phone again, and after firing up Xcode I decided to go ahead and add a few more things that I was meaning to add to the app. The app hasn’t had a good visualization of workouts so I ended up creating an interface for that. Taking cues from Zwift Emily's Short Mix, as seen in Zwift I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel here, so I decided to just copy how Zwift shows workouts, because it works pretty well. Not that I’m trying to write a whole 3d cycling MMORPG, but it helps to know where I am in a workout besides time elapsed and time remaining. The general idea is to code each segment with its color based on the difficulty zone, and its height based on the target wattage of that segment. I previously noted that the target wattage of a segment is based on the product of your own FTP and a multiplier. I did some reverse engineering and found that the color coded “zones” are based on this formula: 0-60% = zone 1 61-75% = zone 2 76-89% = zone 3 89-104% = zone 4 105-118% = zone 5 119%+ = zone 6 I then just mapped the zones with the same colors, with zone 1 being gray, 2 being blue, etc. For the warmup and cooldown segments I just take the high power of those segments. Creating a View Creating custom views from scratch is really not my strong point, but I know enough about autolayout and UIKit to implement whatever views a designer throws at me. Unfortunately I don’t have designer to throw designs at me so I had to come up with something on my own. I was originally going to use a .xib file and set things up programmatically, but I realized that I really didn’t need a .xib and could do everything programmatically. I usually go with a hybrid approach to make the complicated parts easier, but in this case doing stuff in code is actually less complicated. I ended up going with a stack view based layout, where I inserted the views into a horizontal stack view. The view itself has a width anchor based on the percentage of time it takes (if it’s a 10 minute segment in a 30 minute workout then its width would be 33.3% of the container), and then a subview which has a height anchor based on the relative intensity of the segment. It works out pretty well. I threw the view into a UITableViewCell so I could visually get a clue what the workout I was selecting looks like: Finally Some Progress I was pretty happy with the stack view representation of the workouts and left it that way for a few months. Today I was refactoring some stuff and implemented something that was really bothering me for a while. In Zwift you get a really nice view of the upcoming segments, and where you are in your current segment. My app is not really good at this, and there was a bug where it not correctly display the upcoming segment sometimes because of the way it handled workout segment equality. Essentially it was looking for the index of a segment but if there were two exact same segments it would assume the first one was the correct one. Anyway, I fixed that bug by just tracking the actual index of the segment I was on. The other thing I wanted to add was a progress view, so I broke the Workout view into its own class and added a “progress” indicator, which is just a horizontal slider that slides over as you’re working out. This is what it looks like, if I was working out at 10x the regular speed (which would be easier I guess). That’s about it for now! I think this makes my app pretty usable and until I find another thing I need to add to it, I feel like this is a good replacement for Zwift. If you happen to need the exact same thing that I do and also happen to have the same exact exercise bike, feel free to clone the Github repo and use the app!"

        "content": "I was in California about a month ago for work and I was able to attend a few events during WWDC week. I read a lot about the new features and APIs but didn’t really have a lot of time to mess with stuff like SwiftUI, etc. I got a stupid idea for a project but I didn’t really take the time to work on it until this weekend. Now I’d like to introduce you to my latest app: Bark Mode! WTF is Bark Mode? Right after the new APIs were announced at WWDC, I scanned them for anything that might be interesting. I really like being one of the first to try out a new technology, but I figured that everyone would be all over SwiftUI , and I was right. I found a somewhat obscure new feature as part of CreateML that allowed users to generate a ML model that could classify sounds. This SoundAnalysis API in particular seems relevant to my typically immature interests. 💨 #WWDC19 https://t.co/0Aipwa99Lu — Hung Truong (@hungtruong) June 4, 2019 Of course the first thing I thought of was to make an app that could detect farts. I could even make it so that a fart would toggle dark mode off/on. Though I wanted to start experimenting right away, I discovered that you actually needed to have the newest version of macOS Catalina installed in addition to the newest Xcode to use Create ML, and I didn’t have my personal computer handy and couldn’t install a beta OS on my work computer, so I ended up not building it. Fast forward to this weekend, and I eventually got Catalina and all the other prerequisites I needed to get started. Instead of “FarkMode” which doesn’t really make sense, I decided to switch it up this time and detect dogs barking, since “Bark” rhymes better with “Dark” than “Fart.” Plus everybody loves dogs! Perhaps I’m finally maturing in my old age (probably not). Anyway, here’s the steps I needed to take to make my BarkMode app. Creating the model I had seen some videos of people making image classifiers using CreateML in the past. It seemed as easy as creating a few folders with different labels and images of those things. You would have to create one batch for training images, and another for optionally testing the models once they were created. The process for creating an audio classifier is pretty similar except that you need to use sound files instead of images. I started by finding a bunch of stock sound effects of dogs barking. I also found a bunch of random stock sound effects of things like bells ringing, wind blowing, and other stuff that I could label as “not barking.” I feel like this is a pretty wacky way to do classification but if there’s another way that doesn’t involve downloading a bunch of random stock sound effects, that would be awesome. At first I took larger sound files and chopped them up into really short ones. This way I had a bunch of training data that I can use both to train and test my classifier. However, when I ran the Create ML app on the training data, I got an obscure error that the training had been interrupted. I saw that the app thought I only had 3 files when I had created a bunch more. I believe that Create ML is unable to train with really short audio files (less than a second). I ended up inserting the full sound files instead of the short ones. At this point I think I had about 8 or 9 files for either barking or not barking. The model was created but it had a really terrible accuracy. I decided to just add a bunch more files both of dogs barking and things that weren’t dogs barking. The more examples I added the “better” the model became. Polishing the model Create ML has a feature where you can test your audio classifier with audio data coming from your own microphone. When I did this I noticed that the model was too biased towards no sound being barking. I’m not sure why but maybe white noise sounds more like barking than an old timey car horn? I ended up adding a bunch of white noise and recorded some nothing to add to the model. This helped quite a bit. The last thing I did was also record some audio of myself talking so that the model would not recognize me talking as barking. This was useful so I wouldn’t get false positives during my demo video (which I ended up getting anyway in a bunch of outtakes). Integrating the model in the app I created a new app and promptly enabled “Use SwiftUI.” Then I promptly made a new project because I couldn’t figure out where my ViewController class was! I’ll take a look at SwiftUI later but for now I’ll focus on getting my BarkMode app actually working. The Create ML app made a model that I could then copy into my app. It was really as simple as dragging it from one place to another. Looking at the model in Xcode, it describes an interface with an input of “audioSamples” that takes a MultiArray of (Float32 15600). I assumed this had something to do with the number of samples per second and the bitrate of the audio. I fiddled around with the AudioToolbox framework and a few other lower level audio APIs until I discovered Apple’s documentation on the SoundAnalysis framework which provides a much, much easier method of feeding audio to the model. I implemented the steps described and extended my ViewController to conform to the SNResultsObserving protocol. Then it was a few simple steps to write some logic to handle the app detecting no barking to barking and back to no barking, and toggling the dark mode off and on. Finally, I added a label and an image view that takes an image with different assets for the light and dark modes, which changes automatically based on the current setting. The model runs pretty quickly. Here’s a gif of the terminal output from the logging whenever some sound data comes in: If you want to see the app in action, I created this video to demonstrate: As it is, this app isn’t very useful for much of anything, but I could see a few potential uses for the model I trained: Write an app that detects your dog is unhappy when it’s at home and triggers a home automation action like playing music or shooting a treat at your dog Detect if suspicious sound at your house is a robber or just a dog Classify different types of barks and make a dog barking translation app For people who are allergic to dogs, advance warning of incoming dog I’ve posted the full project to Github in case you’re curious about how I implemented the app. I didn’t upload the Create ML project but it just has a bunch of sound effect files and files of me saying gibberish. The model included in the Github repo should work fine anyway. I’m pretty happy with my end result. It’s fun to play around with new APIs and now I can say that I’ve trained an ML model to classify sounds, in addition to implementing Dark Mode! Hopefully I’ll have some time to play with other APIs that were introduced to iOS soon."

        "content": "I’ve been a bit slow to update my blog series about trying to make a clone of Zwift, but not because I’ve stopped working on it. Rather, I’ve been able to use the “MVP” of what I’ve built so far in parts 1 and 2 , and I was finding that the time I spent working on my app could be used actually working out. Like, I literally would write an implementation of something, but it would take so much of my time that I couldn’t test it out and I’d have to go to bed… Still, I was missing a few important features in my app, so I’ve been slowly working on them in between working on my fitness. Hooking up the Apple Watch Zwift’s interface for connecting the Apple Watch works really well One of the great things about Zwift is how much support they provide for different fitness accessories, including the Apple Watch. Unfortunately, the Apple Watch hardware is not set up to allow arbitrary Bluetooth connections like my exercise bike was in part 1. Instead, to access the user’s health information like heart rate, you need to write a full blown WatchOS app! Luckily, this wasn’t my first rodeo as I worked on the Apple Watch app for Starbucks, so I was able to add a Watch app extension target in my project pretty quickly. I Googled for how to get a user’s heart rate programmatically, came across a promising StackOverflow post with a link to a Github project , and was able to get it implemented myself. However, as I looked at the copy-pasta code, it seemed sort of wrong to me. The code was starting a workout session, but then created an object query that would run a closure whenever a new heart rate sample (older than a certain date) was added by the workout. This seems like a really roundabout way to get heart rate samples, and I wondered if Apple had a better API to accomplish this. Implementing HealthKit I ended up finding some Apple sample code that showed a better way to fetch heart rate data. The solution is to use some new features introduced in WatchOS 5 that allow for creation of a workout directly on the Apple Watch. The Apple doc I linked explains it pretty well, but the steps are: Ask the user for permission to track their heart rate data Create a workout configuration (e.g. an indoor cycling workout) and a workout session, along with its associated workout builder Start the session and tell the workout builder to start collecting data samples Respond to the delegate method “workoutBuilder(_:didCollectDataOf:)” to collect a bunch of samples, including heart rate information In code it looks something like this: Rather than add some UI to the watch app to start a workout session, the iPhone version of HKHealthStore has a function called startWatchApp(with:completion:) which will send a workout configuration to the watch to facilitate the creation of a workout. All I need to do is call that function when my workout on the iPhone app starts and my watch app will respond by starting a HealthKit workout session which starts measuring things like heart rate (and calculating its own estimated calories burned). I was now able to get the heart rate as the watch was reading it, and update whatever display on the watch I wanted to. That was only half the story though. In Zwift the heart rate shows up in the user interface, and I wanted to mimic that myself. Since I couldn’t access the workout session directly from the phone I’d have to send the heart rate info back to the main app from the watch. Back to the App This blog post isn’t about Watch apps, so I won’t go over that aspect of this feature too much. I basically used the WatchConnectivity session to send messages back to the app with a dictionary containing the new heart rate. And after all of that programming, I’d like to present you with the most difficult video I’ve ever shot: on an iPad, while balancing on an exercise bike, recording both my wrist watch with my heart rate AND the app showing the exact same heart rate! I also rigged up an initial interface that shows which workout segment I’m on, the next segment coming up, the progress through the segment and my progress for the entire workout, along with stats like calories burned (determined by the bike), cadence and distance traveled. At this point I have a pretty functional app! But seeing the extensive APIs of HealthKit made me want to add more and more to my app. This is scope creep in action. See the documentation of HKWorkoutBuilder to see all of the data and metadata you can store. I ended up sending a few more messages from the app back to the watch so I could store more data to the workout: At the end of a workout, I send the start and end times, along with the total calories burned and distance traveled. This isn’t really necessary because the watch already makes a guess about the calories burned and the distance isn’t real because it’s on a stationary bike. But I thought it might be interesting to see how that data is represented. I also toyed around with sending segment data but I haven’t seen it visually represented anywhere in the workout view. I wanted to see more detail about the workout in the Apple Activity app so I also sent the name of the workout as the HKMetadataKeyWorkoutBrandName value, though I’m not sure that’s what it’s intended for! Here’s what the workouts look like in the Activity app and the Health app’s workout data: One more fun but optional thing I thought of and added was a wrist tap reminder when I got close to the end of a segment. Sometimes I’m just in the zone and not paying attention to the fact that I need to ramp up or ramp down for the next section, so when there’s 5 seconds left in a segment I send a message to the watch from the phone to tap my wrist and send a reminder: One of the nice things about writing your own workout app is that you don’t need to wait for a third party developer to implement any ideas you have for the app! I think that’s actually the only nice thing… Anyway, I’m pretty happy with the results. Next up, I plan on adding a bit of visual polish to the interface and maybe even create an app icon! I also want to aggregate the data like heart rate info, watt effort, etc and keep track of statistics and chart the data, perhaps in real time. I find it very motivating to compare my effort in the same exact workout across different days to see if I’m improving (maybe by measuring heart rate average). As usual, my changes are in Github in case you happen to have the same exact exercise bike as me or are curious how I implemented certain things."

        "url": "/blog/2019/04/07/making-a-zwift-clone-part-2/",
        "content": "A very colorful Zwift Workout Last time, on “Making an iOS Zwift Clone to Save $15 a Month” I wrote about learning Core Bluetooth to connect to my exercise bike and get data streaming directly to my app . Since writing that article, I cleaned up the implementation of the Core Bluetooth service a bit and started supporting some additional data like distance, calories burned and cycling cadence. While cycling on my exercise bike and staring at these numbers is fun, the built-in screen on my bike already shows these numbers, so I essentially recreated a subset of the official ergData app so far. The ergData app is functional but ugly af I realized the next challenge would be to start a guided workout in my app and show the target wattage alongside my actual wattage on the bike. Enter the Workout Zwift workouts seem pretty simple to begin with. You can set up a number of workout segments to guide your workout. There are warmups, steady states, intervals, free ride sections and cool-downs. At any given point in your workout, Zwift will tell you to put in a certain amount of effort. You just try to get your watt number to match what Zwift wants you to do. At first I figured I could come up with my own way of representing workouts, but that would also require me to re-create all of the workouts I usually use on Zwift. Zwift also has a nice workout editor that can use to edit preset workouts or create completely new ones on your own. Zwift’s built-in workout editor is pretty nice! I discovered that if you copy an existing workout to edit it, the workout will be saved as user data and will be synced between all devices. How is the workout data saved, you ask? No, not as JSON as a sane developer would use. It’s XML. Okay, so technically it’s a .zwo file but I know what XML looks like! Here’s a sample of an exported workout file: Hello darkness, my old friend So I went ahead and implemented an XMLParser in Swift to turn .zwo files into my own Workout struct. I won’t bore you with the implementation details but it was kind of a walk down memory lane dealing with the delegation-based API of XMLParser. I’m surprised there isn’t a more modern solution in Foundation but I’m guessing it’s because most people have moved on from XML. Let’s Reverse Engineering By reading the .zwo files, I was able to figure out how Zwift represents their workouts and basically reverse engineer the structure of a workout: Warmups have a duration, a low and high power (which is a percentage of FTP ). The warmup begins at the low power and steadily ramps up to the high power by the end of the segment. SteadyStates are the simplest, with just a duration and power. Intervals are the most complicated, with a repeat number, onDuration, offDuration, onPower and offPower. The intervals segment goes between the high and low power levels, and repeats a certain number of times. I didn’t want to deal with the extra complexity of this type so I just wrote some code to expand them out into SteadyStates. Cooldowns are like warmups but in reverse. There are also some other things like text captions that appear during a workout, free ride segments and cadence settings that I didn’t bother to implement because I don’t use them. The cadence stuff makes sense if you’re using a smart trainer but my bike doesn’t support automatically changing resistance anyway. I decided to represent the WorkoutSegment as a Swift enum since it needs to support a bunch of different formats with varying levels of complexity. I’m actually kinda curious how the Zwift team ended up representing these and if they did something similar. From here it’s pretty simple to get stuff like the total duration or the target wattage for a particular time offset, whether I need to calculate that (in the case of a warmup or cooldown) or if I just return the constant value. Aside from representing the workout segments, the actual workout object will consist of things like the name, description, FTP and other information that pertains to the state of the workout like time elapsed. I wrote a function that takes the current time elapsed in the workout, loops through and finds the corresponding segment and returns the desired wattage. There might be a more efficient way to do that but for now it works. I also added some things to my project for displaying and choosing workouts from a list, and actually displaying the target wattage alongside actual wattage. I want to improve the interface now since it’s terrible, but I’ll save that for another blog post. If you want to check out the project, it’s all here on Github , including the playgrounds I used to test out the workout segment logic before adding it to the Xcode project. Next on my list of tasks is to make the workout interface a lot prettier/usable, and to add heart rate information from my Apple Watch."

        "content": "It’s been a while since I’ve worked on a personal project, but I’ve been having an itch to make some new iOS apps and yesterday morning I decided to go ahead and hack something together. I recently purchased an exercise bike called the BikeErg (I think the name has something to do with the rowing machines that the manufacturer also makes). The bike has a built-in computer that keeps track of things like watts (apparently cycling is a sport that has really good analytics since it’s easy to track raw power), calories burned, cadence and other stuff. You can view the data on the monitor or use an app like Zwift to do workouts. The BikeErg comes with the PM5: the most advanced PM thing ever. I’ve been using the BikeErg to exercise pretty regularly now, and I tried a bunch of different apps that can connect to it. Zwift is pretty much the gold standard as it has many features like 3D avatars and environments, a rich community, and lots of different workout plans for you to try. Zwift integrates with apps like MyFitnessPal and Strava, too, so I can trick people into thinking that I’ve ridden in Central Park one day and London the next. Studies have shown that riding a bike in a completely white room really builds your FTP While I think the feature set of Zwift is really compelling, I’m more of an old school app user. I don’t really care about the online community. I don’t really need to look at my avatar riding his bike around a futuristic city or an exploding volcano. I just want to do some directed workouts and maybe track my heart rate and my calories burned. The price of $15 a month is probably fine for people who use all of those features and get the value out of it, but I feel like I do not.  It’s my virtual dude riding through a virtual New York with all his virtual pals Just to be clear here, I do think app developers deserve to be paid for their work and it’s definitely within reason for Zwift to charge this subscription given the sheer amount of support they need to provide to all of their users’ varying setups. After just implementing a small proof of concept, I have some mad respect for their dev team. However, I am cheap and I’m an iOS developer so I figured, “maybe I can roll my own fake Zwift!” Enter CoreBluetooth The more I stare at this image the less sense it makes I’ve been interested in Bluetooth development ever since CoreBluetooth was added to the iOS 5.0 SDK (I think the first supported device was the iPhone 4s). But every time I tried to sit down and read the documentation I got discouraged by the complexity and ended up getting distracted by some other new shiny API. Since I had a desired use case here: Make a Zwift alternative for myself, I was able to focus up some more and get something working. While the Bluetooth protocol is incredibly flexible, that flexibility also makes it incredibly complicated to get even a simple proof of concept working. If you don’t know what the special Bluetooth jargon means, it can seem really confusing. I still don’t really understand all of it but I’ve managed to hack something together that will serve as a basis for my fake Zwift app. Rather than bore you with the technical jargon and steps required to make this app, I’d rather just go through my process of figuring it out, which may be slightly more interesting. Of course it’s called a “Manager” So the first thing I did was go to this document (which I guess is deprecated now but I didn’t notice that message when I was reading it) which goes over the Core Bluetooth framework. I found out that I needed to create a CBCentralManager, so I did that and then I tried to scan for some Bluetooth devices: let centralManager = CBCentralManager() self.centralManager.scanForPeripherals(withServices: nil, options: nil) I immediately got an error that I couldn’t do that since the centralManager wasn’t powered on yet. Oops! I then set the delegate of the centralManager and waited for the method “centralManagerDidUpdateState” to check that it was powered on before scanning. I soon started getting a bunch of peripherals in my next delegate method, “centralManager(_:didDiscover:advertisementData:rssi:)” Among the things I found were my laptop (over and over again even though the scan was set to not allow duplicates…), someone’s Bluetooth headset and various other things I couldn’t identify. Success!  Once I filtered out the peripherals that kept on repeating, I was able to turn on the bike (by cycling a bit) and I got this message in my logs: I successfully found my PM5. Now to connect to it and get the data. I ended up connecting to the PM5 based on the name. (After doing some reading it looks like I could connect based on the last service UUID of “CE060000-43E5-11E4-916C-0800200C9A66”).  I called the “connect” function of the centralManager and later got an error because the peripheral wasn’t retained (I guess the Central doesn’t keep a strong reference, which makes sense). I tried again, this time keeping a reference to the peripheral in an array. Peripherals, Services and Characteristics Once I connected, I had to discover the peripheral’s services. And once that succeeded I had to discover each service’s characteristics. Once you discover those characteristics you can set the peripheral’s services’ characteristics to “notify” you when the characteristic changes. In more depth: Connect to peripheral using the central’s “connect(_:options:)” method and retain it Handle the “ centralManager(_:didConnect:) ” delegate method where you set the peripheral’s delegate and call its “discoverServices(_:)” method Handle the “peripheral(_:didDiscoverServices:)” delegate method and call the peripheral’s “discoverCharacteristics(_:for:)” for each service you want to discover characteristics for (why not all of them at this point?) Handle the “peripheral(_:didDiscoverCharacteristicsFor:error:)” delegate method for each service’s characteristics you wanted to discover by calling the peripheral’s “setNotifyValue(_:for:)” method on each service’s characteristic that you want notifications for. Optionally handle the “peripheral(_:didUpdateNotificationStateFor:error:)” method to see if you were able to successfully update the notification state for each peripheral’s service’s characteristic. In some cases I wasn’t able to ask for updates, perhaps those characteristics are just static data? Handle the “peripheral(_:didUpdateValueFor:error:)” method to get the updated value for each characteristic that you wanted notifications for. This all seems really convoluted to me and it was probably part of the reason that I always gave up on implementing Bluetooth in the past, but I think that’s more of a symptom of the complexity of the Bluetooth protocol than the CoreBluetooth API. Now all I needed to do was generate some data by cycling on the bike for a few seconds. I wasn’t quite finished yet, though. When the characteristics are updated and you start getting notified, you can inspect the new values, but those values are just Data objects . Each characteristic can hold a number of values based on how the data is structured, and that is up to whoever is implementing the Bluetooth protocol.  I did some research and found this document that describes the Bluetooth specifications for the PM5 device. Just some really interesting light reading In that document were some tables including the one above which describes the UUID for a characteristic that includes things like elapsed time, calories, and most importantly, watts. I discovered that the data was being encoded into bytes, so I took the raw Data object and split it into an array of 8-bit Integers. Once I started printing those arrays I saw something like this: I originally printed out the Base 64 string representation of the Data before reading the doc, which was a lot less useful Because the PM5 was originally set up for rowing machines, the documentation is a bit confusing. It refers to “strokes” which might line up with rpms o..."

        "url": "/blog/2018/05/20/five-simple-steps-to-becoming-an-international-conference-speaker/",
        "content": "Me speaking at iOSCon London 2018. Image copyright Ed Telling A few years ago, I made a goal for myself that I would start speaking at conferences. In the past I had gone to quite a few awesome conferences and I really admired the folks who could get on a stage, share a bunch of knowledge and inspire an audience to do cool stuff. While I had a bit of experience with public speaking (I spoke at some local iOS/Android meetups and moderated two panels at SXSW back in ’11 and ’13), I wanted to try for a “real” conference spot. I think the conference that convinced me to start applying was Swift Summit, which I attended in 2015. There were a number of really inspiring talks, and the community felt really fresh and welcoming. One interesting aside: I learned after joining Lyft that no fewer than three of my current coworkers on iOS spoke at that conference ( Keith , Sam and JP , though only Keith was working at Lyft at the time) and a few others attended that year. I’m not sure if that’s correlation or causation at work. Step 1: Applying to speak According to my Google Doc which keeps track of my CFP applications, I started applying heavily in 2016. There was a gap between when I wanted to apply and when I started to apply simply because I felt I didn’t have much to talk about. Once I had some interesting experience with iMessage and accessibility while working at Starbucks, I figured people might want to know about those things, too. In retrospect I think I probably waited too long. If you are passionate about something, don’t wait until you feel you’re an expert on the subject. That day probably (at least for me) will never come, and you can always do research about your topic once it’s been accepted! In all of my CFPs I use a template which I learned about during my time in the Twilio Heroes program. Essentially, you need to: State a problem or challenge Give some general solutions (set up a straw man) Give your specific solution that is better than #2, because you are awesome. Here’s an example of my iMessage talk, which used that template: (1) Messaging apps are huge and getting huger. With WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook Messenger users in the millions or billions, it’s clear that messaging is not a fad. So how can a developer take advantage of this growth? (2) Starting a new messaging app is probably out of the question. (3) Thankfully, Apple has introduced iMessage app extensions in iOS 10. Learn how to use iMessage to let your users send rich, interactive messages, and learn how to take advantage of the network effects that iMessage app extensions allow, including updates introduced in iOS 11 like Live Message Layouts and the Direct Send API. Step 2: Getting rejected After using this template for talks and applying to pretty much every iOS related conference in 2016, I ended up getting a ton of rejections. This is totally fine and to be expected since I think most conferences get way more talk proposals than they have spots. I also noticed that conferences tend to invite speakers who have spoken before, which is a form of risk management but also kind of unfair for people who have never spoken. The best way to beat this sort of chicken and egg situation is probably to aim at local meetups which are always looking for people to give talks! Another benefit of this is that you get to practice your talk and refine it before taking it to a bigger stage and audience (which is exactly what I did for my accessibility talk that I gave at iOSCon in London this year). Because I had given my talk at an Xcoders meeting two weeks before the conference, I was able to time my talk, practice it in front of people, get their questions to incorporate back into the talk, and feel like I was ready once I spoke in front of a larger crowd. Step 3: Getting accepted The first year I really started getting serious about applying to conferences, my acceptance rate was 1 of 7 ¹ . Success! I attended the first CodeMobile conference in Chester, UK and talked about iMessage apps. The experience of going on stage, sharing something I thought was interesting, and then getting feedback that it actually was interesting to people was great! The attendees were all amazing and I finally got to travel outside of North America for the first time in my life. I had reached my goals and become an International™ Speaker as well as generally becoming an iOS Conference Speaker all in one go. Step 4: Preparation The thing that most people don’t tell you, and the thing that you quickly find out when preparing a conference talk is how much work it is to prepare! As an audience member to some great talks, I always assumed that the talk took maybe a handful of hours to prepare and format. In practice, a talk can take something like 40–50 hours for a 45 minute session. That includes coming up with the proposal, learning about the subject (often this happens after the proposal has been accepted!), coming up with a format that will educate and inspire (and hopefully entertain) your audience, and practicing the delivery of the material. You probably also want to tailor your presentation for the audience you’re speaking to; are they mostly students? What skill level would be most appropriate to present to? What kinds of jokes might work well with your audience? A good amount of the time that I put into preparing talks is practicing. It’s really up to you how polished you want the talk to be, and how comfortable you will be presenting with the amount of practice you’ve put into it. As I mentioned before, presenting early to a smaller group can really help by creating a deadline that is sooner than the actual talk and providing a method of gathering feedback to tweak your talk to make it even better. One thing that’s great about having a conference talk lined up is that you can do some pretty productive stuff while procrastinating. In order to avoid preparing my iOSCon talk, I applied to speak at a conference in New York called !!Con. That application ended up getting accepted, so I started down a pretty vicious cycle of speaking at more conferences! I recently came across this Twitter thread of many speakers sharing their process and how much time they put into their talks: Hey, people who talk at things: How long does it take you to put a new talk together? I need like 50 hours over at least a couple of months to make something I don't hate. I'm trying to get that down (maybe by not doing pictures?) but wondering what's normal for everyone else. — Tanya Reilly (@whereistanya) May 13, 2018 Step 5: Actually presenting Giving the actual talk is kind of a weird experience. After putting a ton of time into a talk upfront, I’ve found that the actual talk goes by faster than I think it will. Once I get up and start talking, I’m more or less on autopilot, and it’s almost like having an out of body experience. It might be because I put all of my brain power into giving the talk, but I can’t even really remember how I did once it’s done. Then at the end everyone claps and hopefully people ask insightful questions and no one asks a question that’s really just a statement that they’re trying to use to prove that they know something. Once I’ve given the talk, I can actually enjoy the conference. I’ve been lucky that the first few conferences I’ve spoken at, I was the first speaker after the keynote speaker on the first day. Going earlier is also nice because then people have seen you talk and they’re usually more open about chatting with you in the hallway. Presenting some more After speaking at CodeMobile in Chester, UK, I didn’t get any talks accepted for about a year. I ended up speaking again in the UK, this time in London for iOSCon in March of 2018. Then I most recently spoke at !!Con in New York in May. I’ll be giving an updated version of my iOS accessibility talk in Boston next month for SwiftFest. This time around my acceptance rate was 3/6, which is much better. I would mostly chalk this up to the fac..."

I’ve written before about getting hacked and I basically knew how to unhack myself, but I put it off for a bit until I checked my website again and noticed that Chrome was warning me to avoid it! This was pretty much the last straw. I decided to move off of self-hosted Wordpress and switch to something a bit more secure. I looked at some options such as Ghost or Hugo but it seemed like Jekyll was the most mature static blog platform, so I went with that. I used a plugin that would generate the Markdown files that I’d need to regenerate my blog. It also ended up transferring my image files, etc, which made it pretty easy to get started. I found a cool looking theme called Long Haul that I ended up modifying quite a bit. I updated the header image, changed up some colors and added an archives page and support for post excepts. What’s currently missing is a site search and category/tag support, but I can live with that. Comments are also gone but you should never read the comments anyway so that’s fine. I’m happy with the speed that the site loads as it’s all static and hosted on Github pages. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend Jekyll to everyone who wants to convert their blog. It’s clearly written by developers for developers as it’s insanely un-user friendly. Don’t get me wrong, the documentation is great, but it’s surprising to me that something resembling a blogging platform has been around this long without anyone setting up a WYSIWYG type of editor like the kind that Wordpress has. I ran into quite a few issues and a pretty steep learning curve while converting my blog. Now that I’m past that, hopefully I can start blogging more often again! (I checked the hilariously outdated “friends” links on my blog and most of them died around 2009 or the domain names ended up failing or being transferred to new owners, so I guess I’m one of the few remaining bloggers of the world)"

        "url": "/blog/2017/12/03/introducing-deadringer-an-iPhone-X-lockscreen-replica/",
        "content": "I got an idea the other day when I was looking at my co-worker’s iPhone X sitting on a desk. I thought that I could have mistaken it for my own phone, since iPhone X comes in two colors and you have a 50% chance of having the same phone color as any other person. I was thinking that if I did mistake it as my phone and entered my passcode, I’d basically be transmitting the key to all of my personal data. That led me to think about how hard it would be to reproduce the iPhone X’s lock screen and spoof one of my own. It turns out that with some experience with iOS development, it’s not that hard. Thanks to the iPhone X’s Super Retina display, a screen full of black pixels is indistinguishable from a device that’s asleep. And thanks to the omission of the home button, and a public API for disabling the swipe to go home gesture, I was able to make a pretty convincing copy of the iPhone X’s lock screen. Your mileage may vary if you’re trying to spoof other iPhone X models. Oh also I just decided to call it “DeadRinger” because I was inspired by security exploits like HeartBleed that basically have their own marketing departments. I wanted my app to have a slightly scary and trendy name as well. On the left is the app, on the right is the real lock screen. I uploaded the source code to a Github repo which has a pretty good README file but I’ll go into a bit more detail about some interesting code implementation for the rest of this post. If you want to watch the full demo video, you can watch it below: Usage I’m not suggesting you actually use this app but here’s the theoretical attack vector. You would load this app on to a phone that you supply (you’d have to be okay with losing it). The only change you would probably need to make is to the wallpaper image which should match the target’s phone. Swap your phone with the target’s phone and then wait for them to try to unlock their device. If the target has a case I guess you’d want to get the same one or swap it when you swap phones. You could theoretically write some networking code to transmit the entered passcode and then use it to unlock the real phone which you have in your possession. The app works by entering the inactive state, which just shows a black screen and mimics the phone being asleep. Upon raising to wake the phone or tapping on the device, the lock screen will show up, then the passcode entry view will appear shortly afterwards. The user can cancel back to the lock screen and if they want they can tap to get back to the passcode entry mode. The app isn’t sophisticated enough to handle things like pressing the physical lock button but that’s considered outside the scope of this proof of concept. The app does intercept swipes up from the bottom which would normally take the user back to the home screen. Implementation Probably the most interesting part of the project is disabling the swipe to go home gesture. You can find documentation about the iPhone X methods for deferring system gestures here . Here’s my implementation below, found in a UIViewController. This prevents an initial gesture but if the user tries again then they’ll go to the home screen and your app will be defeated. Your target will also probably be really confused. There’s also code in the app that handles the visibility of the home indicator, since you want it hidden on the “inactive” screen but visible on lock screen. With the home indicator logic out of the way, there are a few other tasks like making sure the phone doesn’t really go to sleep. This has been possible since iOS 2. The line of code to accomplish that is UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true To recreate the tilt to wake feature, I use a CMMotionManager to sample the device’s pitch. I just guessed that 0.5 would be a good value but it could probably be tweaked a bit. If the device is put back down, it will go to the inactive state, but not while a user is entering the passcode. The real device also seems to wake on a delay so I used a Timer to handle that state change. TODO I’d say my recreation of the lock screen is just about good enough to convince most people that they’re using the real thing, but there are a few nitpicks and details that I didn’t get to in the interest of time (since I’m not actually going to use this app to steal anyone’s passcode). The camera and flashlight buttons on the lock screen have a cool 3D Touch effect that requires you to push with force to get them to fire. I didn’t implement these because I don’t want my target to take a photo, I want their passcode. The flashlight one would actually be simple enough to implement though. iOS 11.2 has a special control center indicator on the lock screen that I haven’t implemented yet. I would just need to do a check on the OS version and add the view if I’m on iOS 11.2 or higher. There are some cool transition animations in the keypad when going into the passcode entry mode in the real view that I haven’t recreated yet. The buttons animate on a slight delay from the bottom up and have a slight zoom animation in. The average person is not going to notice the difference, though. There isn’t a way to get the real notification center items from a user’s device and put them on another device so I’m not going there. For some people I guess the lack of a billion notifications would signal that something is fishy. Possible Solutions I think there are a few ways to solve this “vulnerability” (which I put in quotes because it doesn’t seem too terrible to me). One solution would be to include a “personal security image” like banks do on their login screens. It’s also pretty easy to defeat, though, if you know the target’s image. Plus it’s probably too tacky for Apple to implement. Another solution would be to add a hardware feature like an LED that lights up when you’re entering something into an OS control. There’s precedent for this like how the MacBook camera causes an LED to light up when it’s on. This would also mitigate some other security issues that have popped up. As long as everything is replicable in software there’s always a way to spoof it. As a user you could also immediately cover your phone in stickers or something easily identifiable. Or keep your phone really dirty. Or find some other way to adorn your phone in a unique way . As our phones become the center of our universe, it makes a lot of sense to treat security as a top priority. Hopefully Apple can do something to make our lock screens more secure from spoofing! Disclaimer Please don’t use this app to steal someone’s passcode. That’s not cool. Conclusion I made this app solely as a proof of concept, and I had a lot of fun figuring out the solutions to some technical problems as outlined above. It was also fun trying to get the design of the app as close to the real lock screen as possible. I learned quite a bit about supporting some new iPhone X features and hopefully you’ve learned something from this article as well! Check out my Github repo for more details and feel free to contribute if you’re able to tackle any of the TODOs listed above."

        "content": "It’s been a while since I wrote a year-in-review on this blog, let alone any blog post. 2016 was a big year though, so here’s some stuff I did. In January Emily and I moved from Ann Arbor, Michigan where we had been living for a few years (Emily since grad school and me since the last time I moved back from Chicago in like 2012) to Seattle, Washington. I’ve loved Seattle ever since I moved here in 2009 to go work for Microsoft , and it’s great to be back! I’m working for a coffee company in Seattle called Starbucks (yes, I get free coffee). I get to work on their iOS app and make latte art in my spare time. Here are some highlights: Latte art: Betta Fish (using almond milk) A post shared by Hung Truong (@hungtruong) on Dec 29, 2016 at 10:42am PST Made a pumpkin latte art #latteart #meta #pumpkinlatte A post shared by Hung Truong (@hungtruong) on Nov 18, 2016 at 10:22am PST For the first year that we’ve been here, Emily and I have been exploring the sights in Seattle, including a bunch of parks like Discovery Park, Volunteer Park (which has lots of cute baby ducks ) and Seward Park, among others. With all the free coffee I’m getting, I’m also experimenting with different brew methods including Aeropress, cold brew, and most recently with a Kalita Wave . In June I went to WWDC for the first time as an attendee and got to meet lots of other cool developers. I got a photo with Craig with the good hair who does the funny parts of the Apple keynotes. Next year I’m going to be attending a conference in the UK as a speaker, which I’m really excited about. Last year I got a new digital camera which I started using quite a bit to capture our hikes and other interesting moments. This year I upgraded from the Sony RX-100 to the Fujifilm X-T1 . It’s been really fun learning more about photography as a hobby and reading about lenses and techniques to get cool photo captures. Here’s a few shots that I like, taken from this year: In September I bought a bunch of supplies and built a tiny solar powered charging system on my roof . It was a fun proof of concept and I’m using it to charge some of my lower power devices, including an electric bike that I bought for my commute (when it’s not rainy). I’m guessing that it wouldn’t have enough juice yet to power an electric car, but that’s on my to do list. In October, Apple announced a new piece of hardware, so naturally I wrote a fart app for it . That’s basically the noteworthy stuff that happened to me this year. Moving and getting used to Seattle is basically a full-time job. I’m also keeping myself busy with updating the house and automating it as much as possible using a Samsung SmartThings hub and various light switches, etc. Other random things I’ve been working on are experimenting with Instagram by using a copious number of tags in all of my posts, buying a pair of Snapchat Spectacles and experimenting with those, and cooking new recipes with the pressure cooker I just purchased from Amazon. I’m looking forward to doing more stuff in 2017 and hopefully blogging about it more often as well."

        "url": "/blog/2016/10/31/on-writing-successful-fart-apps/",
        "content": "Last Thursday, Apple held an event where they announced a few things, including a refresh of the Macbook Pro line that killed all of the good ports and added a touch bar to replace the function key row. I was actually in a meeting during the announcement but I had heard of the touch bar through a story about a leak. Someone on Twitter put a bounty of $5 on the first fart app for the touch bar and a friend retweeted it to me. If you know me, you know that I like writing stupid apps and basically making a mockery of the Silicon Valley trope of “making the world a better place.” Specifically, the fart app genre appeals to me as a way to subvert the app ecosystem and make it a little more dumb and weird. The tech industry in particular takes itself way too seriously. In a way, I’m emulating my Computer Science hero Monzy , who created projects like “ Pantscam ” and  a program that morphed people’s faces into butts (which I can’t find the archive of at the moment), all while being a successful nerdcore rapper . While the things he made were somewhat stupid, you can’t deny that the technology was actually pretty cool. Writing fart apps is also a great way to learn about a particular platform. If “hello world” is the simplest app that you can write in a language, a fart app is the simplest non-trivial app you can write, since it touches the UI, the file system and whatever mechanism there is for playing an audio file. In the past I wrote some fart apps for Google Glass and the Apple Watch , which were small enough projects that I didn’t get bored and abandon them, plus I learned something in the process. So anyway, on Thursday I got home from work and installed Xcode 8.1 on my computer. I ended up needing to get another update for macOS Sierra to get the simulated Touch Bar to show up as well. I looked at some sample code, figured out what I needed to do to write the app and finished in maybe an hour or two. It was a good exercise to get reacquainted with macOS development after I stalled on a project I started a few years ago. I pushed the repo to Github, made a demo video and took a screenshot and sent some tweets to the Twitter user who requested the app. I also sent it to some other Twitter users who made similar requests, not expecting anyone to write a fart app less than 12 hours after the hardware for it was announced. On Friday, I posted the Github repo to an iOS developer community on Slack. That’s pretty much all the “promotion” I did. At some point that day, someone posted the project on Product Hunt (good call!) and it kinda just sat there. I went out of town during the weekend but I noticed someone had written a story about the project on Cult of Mac . I figured that would be the apex of my touch bar fart app’s story. At some point during the weekend though, I got a tweet that the Product Hunt entry hit 100 upvotes. Then a few more stories were written today and my project was even mentioned in NatashaTheRobot’s Swift newsletter . I’m guessing that today will be the real apex of this fart app and it’ll slowly be forgotten like my other fart apps before it. So what have I learned from this and previous fart apps? One is that some people take themselves way too seriously to enjoy a good fart app. For example, this person: First, I’m not a kid. My job title has senior in it which must mean something! Also, I have a day job and writing fart apps (a.k.a. learning stuff) is my hobby. Finally, thanks to this hard-hitting piece of journalism , we see that even fart app writers can eventually move on to greater ambitions. There’s also this killjoy from Product Hunt: While I can understand the sentiment that there could be better tech things happening, I also don’t think it’s realistic to see a new Snapchat or Twitter released every single day. Friday was a slow day, so a fart app won! And is it just the subject matter that makes the project immature and pathetic? Like, would a British PM Soundboard be any more appropriate? Bottom line is that this project only took a couple hours out of my free time, which I would’ve probably spent playing a JSRPG anyway. I suppose you could argue that the nonexistence of my app would’ve caused fewer people to waste time discussing it, but I can’t really control how other people spend their time. One cool thing that’s come out of this project is that someone has already forked it and made a soundboard project out of it . This is sort of the whole point of writing an open source fart app: establish a codebase that people can check out, learn from, and maybe even extend into their own thing. I knew from the start that my app wasn’t going to make it into an App Store. I do believe that the Github repo was the first (public at least) to reference the NSTouchBar class. Finally, if you are reading this blog post thinking: “hey, I’d like to be known for making a fart app instead of one of many other useful contributions I’ve made to this planet!” then here are some tips! First off, you need to actually be the first to market on the fart app scene as interest will surely wane as the second, third, fourth, etc fart apps written for the technology are released. Unless you add something really cool, like actual fart smells in addition to sounds, then you probably wanna rush your fart app to market. Second, you’ll need to market your app with some kind of video. When building for cutting edge hardware like the touch bar (which no one has yet) or Google Glass (which literally no one bought),  you can assume that no one will have the hardware or be interested in installing your app, so just make a video! In my experience it helps if you mumble a lot. Finally, share your code by making it available on Github and attach a generous license to it. I used the MIT license but put the wrong year because I copy-pasted it from another app. But I guess my mistake was relatable because more than one person commented on that commit! Your app won’t be worth anything anyway, so you might as well share it. I hope this post has helped explain my motivations for making a touch bar fart app. Partly it’s to prove that I could, and partly make a cool $0.03 on the video ads. P.S. Apple, if you are reading this, please do not ban me from WWDC over this. I promise to write some software using one of your new frameworks for non-fart applications!"

        "content": "I’ve been fascinated with solar energy ever since I was a kid and my brother had a toy with a motor attached to a mini solar panel that you could run under a strong light. In recent years, solar panels have come down in price and now seemed like a good a time as any for me to experiment with it a bit. I took a week long staycation from work a few weeks ago, and in preparation, I did a bunch of research and bought a ton of components to set up an off grid solar thing. I chose to go off-grid because I didn’t want to deal with actually putting the power back into the grid and all the bureaucracy involved (I’m not sure if my power company even buys power back), and the scale I’m working at is super small anyway. Here are the components I used, and why I decided to go with them. They might not be the best choice, because I have no idea what I’m doing, but even so, I learned a lot in the process. The Battery As I was building an off-grid solar charging system,  I needed something to store the energy gathered by the panel. My initial goal with the project was to charge the battery on my electric bike. The bike is something like 12Ah at 48v, so overall the capacity is about 580 watt hours. I only let the bike battery drain to about 80% at most, so I wanted to charge about 100 watt hours at a time. The type of battery I got was a lead acid sealed AGM battery, which is apparently pretty safe and commonly used in this sort of application. After doing some research about these batteries, it sounds like they also last longer if you only let them discharge to about 60-80% of their capacity, so I got a battery that holds 660 watt hours (12v * 55 Ah). I could probably have gone with a bigger battery but this one only cost about $100. I had no idea what sort of connector this battery used when I bought it, but it turns out that it’s a pretty common connector that uses a bolt. The inverter I ended up buying worked out of the box with it and I ended up buying a box of additional eyelet adaptors to make my own wires. The Solar Panel I wanted a panel that would be able to charge up my battery to a decent level each day. I ended up getting probably more capacity than needed, but I can always expand my project later. I bought a 100W polycrystalline (because it was cheaper than mono) panel by Renology because it had good ratings and a good price to watt ratio. The connectors on the panel are MC4 so I ended up buying some additional cable so I could connect the panel to a charge controller. The Charge Controller I ended up getting a cheap charge controller that came at a discount in exchange for me writing a review. I was going to buy one that looked similar anyway, though I’m not sure if it’s the same manufacturer or just a knock off of the one I was going to buy. Either way it is the perfect size for my project at 10A and shows info like the current voltage level of the battery and the amperage going into the battery as well as the load coming out of the usb ports and the load out connectors. I assumed you were supposed to connect the load out directly to an inverter but I read a few posts about how that would be a bad idea. I’m guessing too much load would fry your charge controller. The Inverter I was looking for a pure sine wave inverter, which is supposed to be more efficient and nice to your electronic devices, but I couldn’t find one under $100 so I ended up getting an 800W inverter that seemed pretty solid. As I mentioned earlier, the connectors just worked for the battery, which was nice. I only use one outlet at a time, so I haven’t tested if this thing can actually throw out 800W, but it’s probably a good rule of thumb to get an inverter with more capacity than you’ll need on average anyway. My bike battery charger uses about 140W and a Macbook charger will use 80W. I’m not sure how many watts that is after efficiency lost with the inverter but it’s probably not too terrible. Putting it all together After getting all of the parts I realized that I was missing the connection from the charge controller to the battery. I ended up buying some ringlet adapters that would fit the battery and cut off part of the long wire I bought to make a new wire. This worked better than I thought it would. After that, I was able to connect the panel and battery to the charge controller. I was able to read that the panel was giving something like 3 amps to the battery, which was amazing to me at the time. I also connected the inverter to the battery and was able to run my bike charger. I attached my Smart Things outlet in between the outlet and the charger so I could monitor how much voltage the battery used. It’s interesting because once the battery reaches a certain charge, the charger tapers down its power usage slowly. Finally, I placed the panel on the roof, which was kind of difficult considering how tall the roof is and how short my ladder apparently is, plus how heavy the panel was and how much I’m able to lift above my head while also balancing on top of a ladder… Here’s some photos of the system running just inside the door to the roof. I’ll probably set up a plank or something to drill the charge controller and inverter onto, since right now it’s a little janky. This is the charge controller, battery and inverter charging my bike battery and an iPhone. The highest amperage I’ve seen is about 6, where I suppose the most the panel can give is 8.3 if it was on the surface of the sun. This is the solar panel before I got it on top of the roof Hopefully you found this interesting and are already planning an off grid solar system of your own. I’m happy to say that my ebike is now powered 100% by my project, as well as a bunch of electronics in my house. Also, my house has become a lot more valuable in the case of a zombie apocalypse."

        "url": "/blog/2016/09/06/strange-copy-pasta-in-developer-resumes/",
        "content": "A sample of some UIViews that are basic \"functionalities\" in a \"Multi-view Application\" So for the past few weeks we’ve been trying to hire for a contractor position to work on our iOS app. Along with the rest of the team, I’ve been reviewing resumes on a really corporate looking website that have been submitted by recruiters on behalf of candidates. It’s an interesting exercise because the resumes are almost all in the same exact format and after a while, they really start to look the same. In some cases, this is because a candidate has been rejected and resubmitted accidentally. While scanning through a bunch of resumes, my coworker Will noticed a bullet point that actually appeared in more than one person’s resume: Experienced in creating and custom UIViews, Table Views, Tab Bars and Navigation Bar, which are some basic functionalities in a Multi-view Application. There are a few things that stand out about this. The sentence itself runs on and on, and the grammar used is pretty dubious. Also, the inclusion of this into an iOS developer’s resume tells you nothing because every iOS developer should have experience with these elementary UI elements, and the sentence even sort of explains that at the end. The fact that it appears in more than one resume is surprising, since it’s such a stupid thing to include in your resume to begin with. I was curious about this bullet point, so I suggested that Will paste the phrase into Google. Here’s an interesting slice of the results: While there’s not a direct match, there are links to resumes which have slightly altered versions of the same phrase. The part that is mostly shared is the “…which are some basic functionality in a Multi view Application.” If you google for that, you will find pages and pages of resumes with a bullet point similar to the original. Will even started a tally of “mutations” of the phrase with added embellishments at the end, or with slightly better grammar. I was curious which other phrases in these resumes were common, so I tried googling some of them. Some that I found that had become memes were: Strong Knowledge of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with strategically designing and implementing the software, debugging, fixing and maintaining the software. Developed apps using various iOS design patterns (MVC, Delegation, Target-action and Slide-out Navigation). Proficient in Memory Management: Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) and Manual Reference Counting (MRC). Mobile Application Development (iPhone/iPad) using objective-C, UIKit, Core Location, MapKit, Cocoa Touch and Cocoa Service Frameworks. I have a few guesses as to why these are in so many resumes verbatim. It could be that the candidate simply copied and pasted the bullet points from a friend’s resume and hopefully actually has those skills. Another could be that the recruiting firm offered to touch up their resume for them and did so lazily. While it’s easy to attribute this to malice, it’s probably just good old fashioned laziness. After all, if it works for so many developers, it should work for you! Either way it looks terrible for the candidate and it’s frustrating for people doing the hiring to see such a lack of originality. I already have to go through more than 30 resumes; I don’t want to think I’m going crazy with all the feelings of Deja Vu. My recommendation to developers would be to write, in your own words, what you’ve actually accomplished. Resume writing is annoying, and no one likes doing it, but the downside to plagiarism is that I toss your resume out and assume you’re a terrible person. Also, I’m secretly hoping that this blog post becomes the top Google result for all of these copied bullet points so any curious resume-reviewers realize they’re not going insane. Also, feel free to nitpick my own outdated resume which you can find here on my (way outdated) portfolio site . I haven’t gone in depth at all to discover more of these copied phrases, but I’m willing to bet that a big percentage of bullet points in resumes are simply ripped off from other resumes."

        "url": "/blog/2016/06/28/wwdc-2016-recap/",
        "content": "As a beginning iOS developer, I remember learning a lot of the craft by trial and error, paired with many of the WWDC videos of years’ past. I was very lucky this year to 1) get chosen for the WWDC lottery and 2) work for a company that would support my trip to San Francisco. The week flew by and I went to some really interesting sessions. Here’s the things I found most interesting. Accessibility I’ve been developing some accessibility features since starting at Starbucks, and so I went to the What’s New in Accessibility session. The most interesting developer facing features are the improved Accessibility Inspector (which lets you quickly run accessibility audits, even in the simulator) and custom rotors for secondary actions. I’m still pretty new to accessibility but I imagine enabling custom rotors will be nice since I just used a hack with the headers rotor to enable skipping between content. Swift APIs Although I haven’t been writing much Swift at work (we’re just starting to adopt it), I went to the  Swift API Design Guidelines session. It was interesting to note the conscious decisions to make Swift read grammatically, and how developers are reconciling that with the ways that Swift needs to be compatible with Objective-c APIs. The talk itself was really interesting and worth watching in full, because I’m not going to try to summarize it here! WatchOS 3 As a person who actually bought an Apple Watch and still wears it every day, I would really like developers to take advantage of the performance gains in WatchOS 3 , least of which is leaving apps in memory so they can load much faster! I was also really mesmerized by the power of rich notifications on the watch using SpriteKit and/or SceneKit. I’m worried that the watch is in a catch-22 right now where it’s not really worth the work to develop for it because there aren’t enough users, which aren’t using the watch because of the lack of good apps. Or it could be that the watch really just needs a good weather app and that’s it. Oh well. Search APIs I also went to a session about using search APIs like NSUserActivity and CoreSpotlight. I largely ignored these features in the past, but it would be pretty interesting to hook into the system in order to provide phone numbers or addresses to hand off to maps or some other apps that the user is switching to. Other Stuff I went to quite a few other sessions on things like iOS Photography (which I sort of just went to accidentally and stayed for) and iMessage integration and On-Demand Resources. Overall, the sessions were really great and I found it really nice to be able to attend a talk in person and absorb the knowledge without distractions. It’s true that the sessions are all available either streaming or online shortly after happening, but too often I’m watching a video while also working against some work deadline or only paying half attention. It’s also pretty neat to be among other iOS developers, and it’s kind of hard to believe that companies have a hard time hiring when you can see so many developers in one room! Hair Force One Craig Federighi has become one of the best parts of Apple Keynotes as he’s equal parts funny and informative. Whenever he showed up in the conference center, huge lines of people would gather to take a photo with him. He’s a really tall dude and it’s really nice of him to put up with random iOS developer who want to take a photo with him. The Jacket I received what is apparently a tradition at WWDC; a jacket with the year on it. I immediately felt weird about getting a nice jacket that basically screams “I am the most elite of the elite, because either I or my company can pay $1600 for me to go to a developer conference!” I spotted a few jackets from earlier years in the conference center, as though it’s a way to show that you’ve been in this game for longer and you’re much cooler than people who just got their first jacket this year. I am in the process of de-labeling my jacket with nail polish remover (ask me about it if you’re interested!) and I’ll hopefully get to wear the jacket embarrassment free once the weather gets cooler (it’s a really nice jacket!). I am hoping that Apple stops giving these jackets out at some point and does something like, I dunno, plants a tree for each attendee? Then again, we are talking about a company that makes objects that people literally worship. The Company Store Speaking of products, there’s a company store set up in the conference center where you can buy shirts and baby stuff and hats with Apple logos on them. I was going to buy something but I realized that you’re literally paying $40 for the logo as the shirt itself is a fairly standard bella canvas tee. Plus I already have a WWDC jacket that asserts my dominance as an iOS developer! In Closing Again, I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to go to WWDC this year, for the first time ever. The keynote and sessions were really great and I got at least 3 ideas for future apps, which is a lot more than I’ve had in the past year or two. Hopefully I can go next year do it all over again."

        "url": "/blog/2015/06/18/collecting-wedding-photos-with-twilio-mms/",
        "content": "Last Saturday I got married to my longtime pal Emily . Emily handled a lot of the wedding planning and she did a really great job. I wanted to do some fun things for the wedding and reception and thought it would be fun to make a way for friends to share their photos of our day with us. I was thinking that it would be easy enough to give people an Instagram hashtag and be done with it, but I wanted to make sure all (or at least most) of our guests would be able to participate. I figured that Twilio’s MMS would be a pretty straightforward way for our guests to share photos throughout the day without having to remember a hashtag or use a specific app. I set up a Twilio phone number to receive and send text messages. Actually, I just re-used an old one that I still had enabled since I used it for voice only. Because I wanted to write as little boilerplate as possible, I decided on using the Django web framework which I’m already really familiar with. The Django admin panel was incredibly useful for debugging and made it dead simple to view photos that were sent. I used the django-twilio library which also uses the twilio-python library. I’ve been on a Heroku app hosting streak lately so I made sure the app could be easily deployable on Heroku for free. Since I didn’t have a whole lot of time to build this app (wedding planning takes a lot of attention), I limited my scope to a few goals: Be able to broadcast messages to guests throughout the day. Accept messages that contain MMS images (one or more) and save them to a database. Allow guests to “unsubscribe” to messages in case they didn’t want them. I ended up using Ngrok  to test the app locally, then threw Runscope in front of it for good measure (yo dawg, I heard you like proxies). Runscope was pretty useful in that I didn’t have to keep sending test SMS and MMS messages to my app; I could just replay ones that I had sent previously. It probably saved me ~$1 in fees! It was pretty straightforward to implement all three of these using the Django library I mentioned earlier. Because all Twilio text messages hit just one endpoint, I had to design around different use cases which made my code a bit messy. It was fine for an app I’m only going to use once, though. The code is gross but it worked and I’m glad I didn’t make it more complicated than it needed to be. I was originally going to use the broadcasting feature more than I ended up using it (I wanted to do something like cat facts ) which added a bit to the codebase. As far as final statistics, I received 70 images from guests during and after the event. Some of them are pretty awesome. In case anyone is interested in how the app works/worked, I posted the source code with my hardcoded phone numbers removed and turned into environmental variables. You can check it out here . I am not posting any photos that my guests sent here since they were meant to be private, but here’s a photo I took with my selfie stick of us and the cake!  "

Back when the first iPhone came out, Apple dropped the price a few months after release and early adopters were pissed. No one can say if there will be a real issue with the watch, but I figure it would be fun to make a list of potential ones. Battery-gate (the battery doesn’t last long enough! I can’t wear it to bed!) Bend-gate 2 (the wristband bends too much! It doesn’t bend enough!) Snap-gate (the wristband cracks and snaps! WTF is fluoroelastomer anyway?) Crown-gate (the digital crown breaks off! It spins too fast!) Siri-gate (random people shouting “Hey Siri!” can control my watch!) Shave-gate (The Milanese Loop is shaving my wrist hair off!) Edit: Thought of a couple more this morning: Left-handed-gate (can’t wear watch on right hand, digital crown doesn’t spin right!) Sunglass-gate (can’t see the screen while wearing polarized sunglasses at a certain angle!) White-band-gate (white sport band gets dirty too easily!) I doubt any of these will happen, though Battery-gate seems most likely. Maybe something completely trivial and impossible to predict will ruin the watch launch. What sort of non-issue do you think will fill up the news cycles?"

        "content": "The Idea A few weeks ago, I noticed a tweet from John Sheehan asking if there was an automated tweet -&gt; screenshot tool: I thought it was a pretty interesting concept that would be fairly easy to implement and had a small enough scope that I could use it to learn some more Javascript. After playing around with Ghost Inspector , I knew it would be possible to render a screen capture of a webpage. I just needed to implement the logic for figuring out what area of a page to render, rather than the whole page. The Solution I played around with CasperJS  before finding a StackOverflow post that described that I could do all that I wanted in PhantomJS , which CasperJS is built on. I wrote a script that would take a url as an input and spit a png out to stdout. Then I wrote a node web app in Express that could take the url as a parameter and run the script through the  child_process.spawn  command. I had the express app write the stdout of the child process to a buffer and send it once the script was finished. Done! Heroku I ran into a problem when I wanted to host my app on Heroku. Heroku apparently does not support writing to /dev/stdout, and I only found out about this when my images were being sent as empty files. I looked at some solutions that involved writing to an Amazon S3 bucket, but I didn’t want to incur that much of an operations overhead for something so lightweight. As a workaround, I found that Heroku does allow writing to /tmp, though any files you throw in there are not guaranteed to remain there after the request is over. For me that’s perfect, since the file only needs to exist as long as the request lasts. Finally, I threw together an index view with a form and a button that takes a Twitter URL and loads the image into the same view when you click on “OK.” I got a nice theme from here and hardly customized it. Screenshot in a screenshot inception. I also figured out how to use the “Deploy to Heroku” feature by adding an app.json file to my git project. There were a couple of other issues I ran into that I didn’t describe yet, mostly getting PhantomJS 2.0 to run on Heroku (because previous versions don’t render webfonts correctly) and setting up the multiple buildpacks on Heroku. You can see what I ended up using by inspecting the Github project here . I called the project Audubon after the Audubon Society  which is really into birds (get it? birds, tweets?). You can deploy it yourself with this button: TODO There’s a couple of things I need to wrap up in this project. If anyone wants to they could also fork the project and throw a pull request at me, but I’m planning on doing these eventually: Make the command line tool better for generating images (right now it just writes to /tmp so I should make that configurable). Make a bookmarklet so it’s easy to create images from the Twitter website. Make the web index page look a little nicer Maybe provide image format and quality options Overall I think this was a really good side project in terms of scope and complete-ability. I learned a lot about Node.js, ExpressJS and PhantomJS. I’ve been meaning to level up my Javascript web game, and this project has been a useful exercise."

        "content": "Act 1 Ikea Stockholm. The average college student would scoff at such luxury, but as a first-time homebuyer, I wanted the best. When I saw the Ikea Stockholm TV Unit (in walnut veneer), I knew I would have it. The problem was that it never seemed to be in stock. Behold the majesty. I must have waited for months, maybe even a year, to see if the unit was available in my Ikea store, but apparently there were production issues. The Ikea phone support was never useful and just told me to check again later. I was stuck waiting it out while my current Ikea (non-Stockholm) tv stand bowed under the weight of my 60″ television. On a random visit in December, though, my interest was piqued. The “buy” button was actually there on the page! I tried faking an order and got a preliminary ship date! For whatever stupid reason, I thought this meant that the supply issues had been fixed. I delayed. I wanted to make sure the thing would fit in my living room. I missed out. Later that week, when I checked the site, the unit was gone. Act 2 I noticed that the website did something weird when I tried buying the tv unit. The “buy” button was still working. The item was added to my cart. But when I tried to enter my address, I would get an error in my cart saying the unit wasn’t available. There must’ve been some issue with their inventory system. Instead of checking manually every day to see if Ikea had any real stock, I decided to automate the process using a tool called Ghost Inspector. Ghost Inspector is a service that lets you define actions for a headless (ghostly) web browser to run for you. It’s mostly intended for running tests on parts of your website (like verifying that a user can log in, get some data, not get an error, etc). If you end up changing a part of your website and it breaks another, Ghost Inspector can automate the process of discovering that regression. As the title of my blog post implies, Ghost Inspector can also tell you when that piece of furniture you want goes back in stock. To get started, I created a free account on ghostinspector.com . The free tier allows you to run 100 automated tests per month. This was more than enough for me to check Ikea once every day. To create a “test,” you can either download a Chrome extension that assists you in recording a test, or enter steps into the site itself using actions and CSS selectors (you can also use the extension to record a rough version of a test and edit it later, as I did). This is what my first test run looked like after I recorded the process of adding the item to the cart, entering my address info and trying to check out: As you can see, the test failed, which is bad, because I was testing to see if the item was out of stock (which I knew was true). The Ghost Inspector recorder picked up that I clicked on a button with a “pressed” state active. Unfortunately, the headless browser doesn’t hover over a button when clicking it, so it didn’t actually see this element and couldn’t click it. I fixed this by selecting the ‘a’ tag with the specific id that I knew would actually add the item to my cart (I also made the browser pause in case something needed to finish loading before hitting the button): Here’s the screenshot of my successful (empty cart) test: At the end of the test, I created an assertion that an element with class “#cartTableError” exists, which shouldn’t happen if your cart is full of Stockholm awesomeness and ready to be shipped. With the test running automatically every day, all that was left for me to do was wait until Ghost Inspector emailed me to notify me of the test “failure,” which meant the item was in stock. Act 3 The fateful day. I got an email from Ghost Inspector that my test failed. I hurriedly typed “ikea.com” into my browser. The product page slowly revealed itself and I girded my loins for the moment I could click “buy.” But the buy button wasn’t there! The test failed because the website now correctly showed that the item was not for sale. Boo! Test failed, but not the way I wanted I had to write another test. But unfortunately, I couldn’t assert the non-existence of an object. Instead, I faked clicking the buy button (which apparently worked fine) and then tested whether the cart was empty when I clicked to it. The test looked like this: Apparently this is a stupid test because it is actually still passing. But Ghost Inspector has a feature where it takes a screenshot after every passed test and compares it to the next test. In this case, the screenshot diff test failed and I was notified  a few days ago. And it turns out that the tv stand is actually in stock! A comparison of screenshots. Epilogue I’ve ordered the tv stand and it should be on its way by the end of the month. Many thanks to Ghost Inspector for creating a free tier for this service so that furniture aficionados like me can automate their obsessive compulsive shopping. But in future versions, please support: More specific selection of css selectors when using the Chrome recording tool Negative assertions that check when an element doesn’t exist. (I can probably do this by evaluating Javascript but tests take so long to run that it’s hard to debug) If you’re interested in creating automated tests for your website (or in getting notifications for furniture availability), definitely give Ghost Inspector a shot."

        "content": "Since I moved to a new home that’s closer to work, I’ve been riding my bike to commute at least a few times each week. My commute to work is very easy as it’s almost completely downhill. I pay for it on the way back, though. I’ve been trying to get healthier, so commuting with my bike has definitely become a priority. In addition to having fun, I’d also like to motivate myself to ride more often and push myself to get better at it (especially the uphill part). I’ve been using Strava to track my rides, and it turns out that my ride home includes a user-generated segment that automatically tracks my performance when I’m going uphill on Liberty. The first time I rode, it took 10:44 for me to complete. My best time so far is 6:58. The cool part is that I’m able to see the progress I’ve made, and I really do feel accomplished when I beat one of my best times. Here’s the view I’m using to see what my times are: This isn’t the easiest table to read, but you can see that the dates sort of correlate with my times, as the fastest one is in September and the ones in August are slower on average. While beating my fastest time is a good motivator, it’s not realistic to try and break my record every time I ride. I’d rather see consistent improvement as a motivator. To visualize this, I decided to grab all of the times by viewing the full leaderboard (with just my results). I gathered the times and dates and thew them into a Google spreadsheet to visualize my trend. Here are the results so far. Success! It looks like I made some really good progress since I started in July, and my times have been inching downward as I get better at cycling uphill. The times also probably vary a bit because there are some stop signs and a traffic signal within the segment, which can slow me down. The next problem I wanted to tackle was the data entry bit. Since it’s a pain to update the spreadsheet each time I ride,  I wanted to automate the addition of new efforts (the term that Strava uses to describe single instances of activities on a segment). This is where things get interesting. Because I’m storing the efforts in a Google Doc, and because Strava has an API, I just need to connect the two together. Unfortunately, my go-to choice for this kind of thing, IFTTT , doesn’t have Strava as a channel. Luckily, I can do something similar with Zapier  (btw that’s a referral link, so be sure to click it so I can get more tasks), which is sort of like IFTTT but costs money (albeit with a nice free tier) and has more integrations. You can also set up your own integration, which is what I had to do with Strava. In order to get the list of my efforts on that particular segment, I had to create a few Zapier “triggers.” One to get my Strava user ID (for use in other API endpoints), another to grab my starred segments (so I could specify which segment I wanted to track), and finally a trigger to listen for any new efforts on my commute’s segment (limited to efforts created by me). I also had to post-process the last trigger so that I could get the date in a format that works in Google Spreadsheets. The result looks something like this: Now, whenever I ride home on my bike while recording the segment with Strava, the effort will be automatically logged and graphed on my Google Spreadsheet! Apparently, I can embed the chart, so here it is! While the Zapier integration had a somewhat steep learning curve, it’s nice to just set the “zap” and then forget about it. Any new integrations I might need to write will also go much quicker. As always, Runscope was a really useful tool for exploring the Strava API and getting real responses from the API to play around with. Finally, I learned the right way to spell athlete rather painfully (after misspelling athlete_id a billion times and wondering why my request wasn’t filtering correctly)! I went from seeing some sketchy looking progress in my Strava results table to being able to visualize it on a graph, while also setting the graph up to update whenever I record a new effort! Automation for the win! If you’re interested in the details of the integration, or if you want to try it out yourself, let me know and I can invite you as a tester. If there’s a lot of interest, I can also go over the creation of the integration, as I ran into a few gotchas while building it."

        "url": "/blog/2014/07/28/impressions-of-android-wear-lg-g-watch-with-my-nexus-5/",
        "content": "I finally got the LG G watch that I won in a contest about a week ago. I replaced my Pebble smart watch with the Android Wear device along with using my spare Nexus 5 instead of my iPhone. It’s been about four days or so since I made the switch so I thought I’d write up my impressions. The Watch The LG G watch is one of the two currently available Android Wear devices for purchase. My coworker Jason, who also won a watch in the same contest, got the Samsung model. We both would have rather had the Motorola watch, but it isn’t available until later this summer so Google decided to send us these ones. The LG watch is not particularly fashionable. It looks like a pretty generic black rectangle with rounded corners. It comes with a pretty neat charging base that you can magnetically attach the watch to. I would’ve preferred some kind of wireless charging, but this gets the job done, and the watch actually charges pretty quickly. The quick charge time is good because the watch only last about 24 hours anyway. The Software The software for the LG watch is basically an enhanced version of the notification dock in Android. This actually mirrors Google Glass a bit, but the execution is less awkward because you’re not wearing a watch on your face. Each notification that lives on your phone will also appear on the watch. If the notification is enhanced, you might be able to take action on it through the watch. For example, you can reply to a text message or Google Hangout by dictating a message. This is probably the killer app of the watch, though I feel like talking to your watch is still going to be considered antisocial behavior. Aside from the notifications, you can also tell the watch to take notes, send e-mails, and set alarms. The watch still relies pretty heavily on your Android phone, though. Notes get saved to Google Keep (which I am not really sure is an app that will stick around), and GPS navigation simply opens Google maps on your phone. I’m guessing that in the future the watch will get smarter, but for now I think that’s a pretty decent feature set. I’ve been toying around with the idea of writing an app that creates a persistent notification that just shows me how late the bus is going to be in the morning. Every morning I check the AATA website to see how late my bus is going to be. The information is contextual and time sensitive, and I only need it for that one time during the day, so it would make sense to make this something that shows up on my watch when I need it and goes away when I don’t. I think that Google Now could do this to some extent, but it’s not smart enough to know that I want to leave 5 minutes before my bus comes around and not when it’s “scheduled” to arrive. Android In order to fully test out the Android Wear watch, I took my SIM card out of my iPhone 5S and put it into my Nexus 5. So far the transition hasn’t been too difficult as I mostly rely on Google services anyway. There aren’t really any apps on the iPhone that I haven’t been able to use on my Android phone. I may have said this before in previous blog post, but I really think that the quality of Google’s services is catching up to the polish of the iPhone. Consider how bad Apple’s online services are, and how good Google’s are. I can live without iCloud and Apple’s email service (does anyone use their .me email as a real email address?), but I am locked into Gmail, both personally and professionally. I am guessing that Google could increase Android’s marketshare sharply by simply withdrawing support for all Google services on iOS. Meanwhile, Apple is relying more and more on third parties to fill out the expertise that it is lacking (I mean, really, who the fuck uses WebObjects?). I can’t really see a situation in the long term where Apple beats Google on services, either directly or by convincing third party developers to do it for them. As for whether I am actually switching to Android as my main device, I’d need to see what Apple has in store for their next generation. (Sadly, this LG G watch is not nearly awesome enough to make me switch on its own) On top of the awesome built-in services of Android, the material design stuff coming from them from this past I/O is looking pretty sweet. If Android can give iOS a run for its money in terms of look and feel, and ease of creating really nice custom views and animations, then developers might just defect en masse. I guess the only thing Android needs to do now is get away from Java (if Apple can do this with Swift, then I’m sure Google can figure it out), because developing on it really sucks the joy out of being a developer. Anyway, enough reverse-fanboying. I think it’s time for the… Conclusion While I think Android Wear does a lot of things right, and it has a lot of potential, the watch really isn’t all that revolutionary. To put it in terms of the HBO show SIlicon Valley, it’s not disrupting or making the world a better place through compression algorithms. It also isn’t a particularly stylish piece of metal and glass, so I wouldn’t wear it if it didn’t serve a purpose. Having said that, Google stuff is all about the integrated services, so I am feeling bullish on the fact that Google Now is always getting smarter, and developers should be able to hook into it, giving it a bit more life than it has right now. Would I buy it if I hadn’t won it? Maybe if I was an Android user already anyway, but I tend to buy too many gadgets as it is."

At the end, it was announced that there would be a few vouchers for Android Wear devices available. A design contest was announced and the deadline was set at Sunday. Being naturally competitive and really into new technology, I made a design mockup for a home automation app that I thought would be useful to have on a wearable device (the most common form factor happens to be a watch). Here’s my submission that I originally posted to Google Plus : The app uses the user’s location as a way to provide feedback only when it’s necessary, and to stay out of the way when it isn’t. In this example, the app can detect when a user is arriving home and can ask if they want to switch the lights on. Instead of switching individual lights on and off, the user can create preset groups and activate them with voice commands. Users can set commonly used groups like “living room” and “kitchen.” Night owl users can set reminders to go to bed, and the app can turn off lights if the user decides to stay up late. The app can also use sensors to detect when motion is occurring in the home and alert the user if no one is supposed to be at home. The user can decide whether the motion is a false alarm or if further action should be taken. There is obviously much more that can be done with a home automation app, but these are just a few scenarios that would work well on an Android Wear device. I’m looking forward to experimenting on Android Wear when it becomes available! I heard this week that my submission was a winning entry, so I’ll get an Android Wear device as soon as they go on sale some time this Summer. Thanks to Google and the GDG group here in Ann Arbor for setting up the event!"

        "content": "This past month at FarmLogs , we implemented a versioning scheme for our internal API. API versioning is often a difficult transition to make, especially if you’re using a third party API and dealing with deprecations (Facebook, I’m looking at you!). It’s often a chore to figure out exactly what has changed between API versions unless you have very good documentation. Coincidentally, Runscope also has a service called API Changelog that can send you notifications when a third party API changes. Luckily for me, any changes to our internal API were subject to review by our team of engineers, so if I had any questions or concerns, I could bring them up in person. Even so, when dealing with a changing API, the truth is in the response, not necessarily the documentation (or Hipchat or Hackpad ). For a while, I was updating the iOS client to the new version by copying and pasting the two responses into a text editor and looking at the differences. About halfway through I remembered that this functionality is built into Runscope , so I started using that. I’ll show you how to compare diffs of two responses so you don’t have to waste half of your time like me! Prerequisites To follow along with this blog post, you’ll need just two things: A free Runscope account. A free developer account at Foursquare . Some versioned API data I’m not going to post the inner workings of the FarmLogs API (though it’s pretty easy to reverse engineer, like many other APIs) since that’s probably confidential knowledge or something. Instead, I’ll use the Foursquare API, which is one of my favorites to work with and (in my opinion) has some of the best documentation around. Browsing around their developer page, I found this interesting summary of API changes over the years . There was a pretty huge change on 6/9/12 that included many breaking changes. Sounds like fun! I actually remember getting caught in this change and having to update my iOS auto-check in app to fit the new API. Let’s pick an endpoint and see what the data used to look like. We’ll be able to compare it to the modern version of the API. For our example, we’ll hit the /venues/explore/ endpoint. This endpoint takes a lat/long value and returns a list of suggested venues to try. If you are authenticated, it can give you personalized info about why those venues were suggested (like if your friends went there and liked it). If you go to this page , you can get a url for that endpoint along with an oauth token added for you automatically. Hitting the endpoint in Runscope Next we’ll copy and paste the Foursquare API url into Runscope. You can create this request in a default bucket or make a new one specifically for this test. Just hit the “New Request” button and paste the url in. Hit the “Launch Request” button to have Runscope make the API request on your behalf and save all of the data for you to compare later. If all goes well, you should see the response appear below the “Launch Request” button. Next, we’ll edit the request so that the format matches the API before the big change on 6/9/12. Foursquare uses a pretty awesome convention for API versioning that uses dates for versions. To edit the response, simply hit the pencil icon on the upper right part of the response. You’ll be taken to the response editor. From there, change the “v” parameter to 20120608 (my 29th birthday!). Hit “Launch Request” again and Runscope will fetch the response from Foursquare for a client that’s using a really old version of the API. After a short wait you should see another response appear. You can either hit the “Compare to Original” button or go to the “All Traffic” section to pick two requests to compare. Comparing two versions of the same request Finally we’re at the meat and potatoes of this post! Let’s explore the difference that two years can make to an API endpoint. (For all of these screenshots, the older version is on the left) The first thing to notice is that Foursquare is really polite about their deprecation warnings. I wonder how standard their meta dictionary with an error message is. I suppose it works well if you have humans reading your API (as we are now) but I’m going to assume most clients do not care about the meta error being shown in this deprecated API call. I wonder if there’s an HTTP status code for “OK now but will be deprecated soon.” Another thing to notice is that there is a new “reasons” dictionary for each venue suggestion that lists friends that have gone to that venue. It looks like this dictionary didn’t exist before the 6/9/12 API update but probably exists in the older version of the API for compatibility reasons. The tips section also seems to have gotten less info about the user giving the tip. I’m not sure if this is for privacy reasons or something else. Another thing I noticed was that the older version included a tip that I created myself while the newer version removed it (probably because the authenticated user isn’t interested in their own tips when exploring). Finally there’s the terrible implementation of icon images for categories that Foursquare provides. The old format had a prefix, file format and an array of possible sizes for the icon. You’d have to piece the three together like the silver monkey statue  to get an icon for your app. The newer version did away with the list of sizes (now you just need to choose a size from 32, 44, 64, and 88). Conclusion As you can see, Runscope makes it really easy to compare the differences between API versions. Hopefully all of your API version migrations will be smooth and come with months of warning, but in case they don’t, Runscope can be a pretty handy tool to get a handle on what’s changed. If you have any questions or comments on this or other tools to ease the pain of API version migration, please let me know by posting a comment!"

        "content": "A few weeks ago my friend Emily asked me to speak at the Ann Arbor Mini Maker Faire for their speaker series. I said “sure” and figured I’d talk about something like app development or design. I ended up picking a more “Maker Faire-y” topic since I thought it would work better for the crowd. I’ve been really getting into home automation and buying a lot of “internet of things” products lately. I decided to do an introductory talk on home automation along with ideas on how people can get up and running quickly. I did the talk last weekend and had a great turnout. Some people asked for more information so I thought I’d write up a blog post that more or less summarized the talk. So here it is! What exactly is the “Internet of Things?” “The Internet of Things” is a term that gets thrown around a lot but doesn’t seem to have an official definition. I like to think of it as the concept that, as devices gain more intelligence through the ability to communicate wirelessly and through the internet, they become more useful. In other words, things will form their own internet and will generally be awesome. I was reminded the video game, Megaman Battle Network , where literally everything, including a microwave, has a port to jack into (and can thus catch a virus). It also means that your refrigerator might be able to tweet when you run out of milk, or stream music via Pandora. Why am I hearing so much about the IoT right now? In the past few decades, we’ve seen the cost of producing software go way down. Starting a software business simply costs less today than it did in the 90s. While hardware always brings more upfront costs, it seems like commodity hardware and Kickstarter are making it easier for smaller companies to get into the hardware game. On top of that, wireless technologies like Bluetooth LE and low power Wifi are enabling devices to talk to one another as well as to the internet. In the past few years we’ve seen large companies like Belkin get into this space as well as smaller startups like Nest (though they were aquired by Google pretty recently). Some things you can accomplish I’m just going to list a few use cases that I consider to fall in the category of “Internet of Things.” After I give an initial survey, I’ll go into ways that you can use these off-the-shelf solutions to automate your home. Turn on/off light switches One of the simplest use cases for home automation is turning off/on light switches. You can do this with the Belkin Wemo (which is what I use) or with something like Ninja Blocks or SmartThings . Detect Motion You can use Dropcam  to detect motion with video, or Wemo / SmartThings to detect motion events. This is mostly useful indoors if you don’t have pets since they can set false alarms. Detect when doors/windows are open You can use SmartThings to detect when a door or window has been opened. This could be useful for knowing if you left a window open while it’s raining, though it would be even more helpful if it could close the window for you automatically. Detect water moisture / floods Apparently it really sucks to have a flood in your basement. It might be worth the extra money to install a SmartThings moisture detector to tell you if there’s a water leak or flood. Lock or unlock your front door I ordered a Lockitron a really long time ago and am happy to announce that it should be shipping soon! I also found a product by Schlage that seems to do something similar. Keep track of your driving Automatic  helps you keep track of your MPG and total distance traveled by connecting to the data port of your car. Don’t kill your plants This is a fairly stupid product called the Parrot Flower Power that can remind you to water your plant when the soil gets too dry. It’s probably more cost effective to just buy a new plant if yours dies from under/over watering but whatever. Keep track of how many eggs you have left The Quirky Egg Minder keeps track of how many eggs you have in your fridge. Recipes with IFTTT / Zapier IFTTT (if this then that) is an online tool that makes it easy for non-programmers to connect different internet and mobile services to each other. Think of it as glue that can tie all of your IoT devices together via triggers and actions. A trigger might be that your Wemo has detected motion, and an action might be to open your garage door. IFTTT works well with many of the devices I’ve listed previously and offers an iOS and Android app that can hook into things like your location and photos. Zapier  is another tool that is similar to IFTTT but a bit more complicated and expensive to use. Some recipes are only compatible with Zapier (like Lockitron) so you might need to sign up for that service as well. I’ll share a few recipes on IFTTT or Zapier that you can use to automate your home with your newfound gadgets. Play the radio when a burglar enters your home This recipe is possible without using IFTTT (and is probably more secure since it doesn’t require internet). I set up my motion detector to turn on a switch that’s connected to a portable radio. During certain hours when I’m not at home, if someone enters my house, the radio will start playing. The hope here is that the noise will be a deterrent to the invader. If I was feeling in a Home Alone mood, I could also connect the switch to a tape player that played scenes from a mobster movie.  Make sure your doors are locked when you leave home When your IFTTT mobile app detects that you are leaving your home, you can send an email that Zapier can use to connect to Lockitron to ensure that your doors are locked. This is a pretty convoluted recipe since it uses both services, but there isn’t really a better way to do this, unless you want to simply lock your door with the Lockitron app when you leave. Automatically start the coffee maker by waking up This is a really cool IFTTT recipe I found that was shared by another user. The Jawbone UP 24 has a feature that can wake you up at the best time in your sleep cycle in the morning. The UP can send a message the moment you wake up to IFTTT that can turn on a switch that’s connected to your coffee maker. Voila, your coffee is ready as soon as you get out of bed. Log all of your driving trips in Google Docs I use this recipe to keep track of total miles driven and my fuel efficiency. It’s not particularly useful for anything, but if I was a taxi driver (or Lyft or Uber X) it might be pretty useful for tax purposes. DIY Home Automation One thing I haven’t really touched on is creating DIY projects to automate your home. I’m a big fan of home grown projects like this DIY Lockitron using Arduino . I recently bought a Raspberry Pi to act as an iBeacon in my home. I’m trying to create an app that will be location aware to the room in my house that I’m in (or at least that my iPhone is in). I’ve heard that the best way to predict the future is to invent it, so if there’s anything in this space that you haven’t seen available, the best solution is to do it yourself! If you have any interesting projects or recipes you’d like to share, I’d love to hear about them. I am about to move into a new house, so the automation potential is about to grow a lot more for me (versus living in an apartment). Good luck and try not to get any viruses in your microwaves!"

        "content": "Since the beginning of time, humans have wanted to mount small computers on their heads. In 2013 we got our wish, as Google started releasing Glass onto explorers and developers alike. In November of 2013, Google released a “Sneak Peek” of the GDK, a way to write native code for Google Glass. While the GDK is still under development and will probably change quite a bit before being finalized, those on the cutting edge will want to familiarize themselves with it. In this quick start guide, I’ll go through the steps of writing your first GDK app, “Where Am I?” This app will ensure you are never lost. By simply shouting “Okay Glass, where am I?” the app will find your latitude and longitude, and try to find the nearest street address. Prerequisites In order to start writing native apps for Google Glass, here’s what you’ll need: Google Glass! There is currently no way to emulate the device and its sensors, so getting a real device is a must. You can request an invite directly from Google here , or search on Twitter for someone with a spare invite to share . ADT – Android Development Tools is basically a plugin for Eclipse that lets you compile and load your native code onto Glass. Source Code (optional) – I’ve included the source code for this app on Github here . If you want to follow along without copying and pasting a bunch of code, you can simply skip back and forth by running git commands that I’ll describe later on. Getting Started Google Glass runs on a special version of Android, “Glass Development Kit Sneak Peek” – a tricked out version of API 15.  You’ll need to download this version with the Android SDK Manager within ADT (you can open it by clicking on the icon of the Android with a blue box and an arrow on it). Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to create a new Android project with the correct SDK settings. Use API 15 for Minimum and Target SDK, and set “Compile With” to the GDK Sneak Peek. Congratulations! You’ve created a project that should run on Google Glass! If you try running the app on your device, it may or may not work, since it won’t have a voice trigger associated with it yet. We’ll add a voice trigger in the next step. Adding a Voice Trigger If you’re following along with git, you can type the following command to fill out all the code for this step: git checkout -f step-1 Because Google Glass is such a new paradigm for user input, we’ll need to set up a voice trigger to allow the user to start our app. To do this, we’ll add some some strings to our strings.xml and add an xml resource that describes the voice trigger. Finally, we’ll add an intent filter to our AndroidManifest.xml to register the voice command. In res/values/strings.xml &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt; &lt;resources&gt; &lt;string name=\"app_name\"&gt;WhereAmI&lt;/string&gt; &lt;string name=\"action_settings\"&gt;Settings&lt;/string&gt; &lt;string name=\"hello_world\"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/string&gt; &lt;string name=\"glass_voice_trigger\"&gt;where am I?&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/resources&gt; In res/xml/whereami.xml (you can name this file anything as long as you refer to the same file in AndroidManifest.xml &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt; &lt;trigger keyword=\"@string/glass_voice_trigger\" /&gt; In AndroidManifest.xml: ... &lt;intent-filter&gt; &lt;action android:name=\"com.google.android.glass.action.VOICE_TRIGGER\" /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; &lt;meta-data android:name=\"com.google.android.glass.VoiceTrigger\" android:resource=\"@xml/whereami\" /&gt; ... Now, if you run your code on Glass, you should be able to find the “Where Am I?” command in the Ok, Glass menu! Using Glass Cards We’ve gotten voice commands working, and that’s half the battle. Next we’ll learn how to use Cards, the native user interface for Glass. We’ll need to remove the existing style, then instantiate a Card object, set up its text and set it as the content view. Remove the line in AndroidManifest.xml that reads: android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme\"&gt; Import Card from the GDK and create a new Card instance in OnCreate() ... import android.view.View; import com.google.android.glass.app.Card; public class MainActivity extends Activity { private Card card; @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); card = new Card(this.getApplicationContext()); card.setText(\"Getting your location...\"); View cardView = card.toView(); setContentView(cardView); ... If you run the app, should see something like this: Getting Location and Updating the Card If you’re following along with git, you can type the following command to fill out all the code for this step: git checkout -f step-2 Finally, we want to get the Glass’ location and update the card with the appropriate info. Our lost Glass Explorer will be found and all will be well. We’ll do this by requesting location permissions, setting up a LocationManager and handling its callbacks by updating the card with lat long and a geocoded address, if available. Ask for permissions for user location and internet in AndroidManifest.xml ... &lt;uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\" /&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_LOCATION_EXTRA_COMMANDS\" /&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /&gt; ... Create a LocationManager that uses certain criteria to figure out which location services it can use on Glass in MainActivity.java ... locationManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE); Criteria criteria = new Criteria(); criteria.setAccuracy(Criteria.ACCURACY_FINE); criteria.setAltitudeRequired(true); List&lt;String&gt; providers = locationManager.getProviders( criteria, true /* enabledOnly */); for (String provider : providers) { locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(provider, 1000, 10, this); } ... Implement callbacks that will update the card when you get a location update in MainActivity.java @Override public void onLocationChanged(Location arg0) { //show lat long to user String lat = String.valueOf(arg0.getLatitude()); String lon = String.valueOf(arg0.getLongitude()); card.setText(\"your location is \" + lat + \" \" + lon); Geocoder geocoder = new Geocoder(this); try { List&lt;Address&gt; addresses = geocoder.getFromLocation(arg0.getLatitude(), arg0.getLongitude(), 1); if(addresses.size() &gt; 0) { Address address = addresses.get(0); String addressString = \"\"; for(int i = 0; i &lt; address.getMaxAddressLineIndex(); i++) { addressString += address.getAddressLine(i) + \" \"; } card.setFootnote(addressString); } } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } View cardView = card.toView(); setContentView(cardView); } The app should now start getting location updates on the Glass (it can take a while to get a good fix) and update the Card once it finds you. The result should look something like this: Congratulations! You’ve finished your first Glass app. Future generations will wonder how they ever knew where they were without a head mounted computer printing out their exact location on the earth into a glowing prism directly above their field of vision at all times!

        "content": "Here’s a giant post of stuff I’ve been doing with Google Glass! I made a survey, wrote an app and am running a contest, so that’s all bundled into this blog post. Survey I got a Google Glass invite after signing up at Google’s official waitlist . After deciding I would go ahead and get one, I was paralyzed by the choice of which color to order. I made a survey that asked participants to rank the five colors in order of awesomeness. The results surprised me. I was leaning towards white (cotton) and sky blue, but everyone seemed to really like tangerine (orange). Tangerine wins by a landslide! I was going to go against the popular vote and get the white one, but both the white and black ones were out of stock at the time, so I went for the fan favorite. I ended up getting the Tangerine device the day after I ordered it (next day shipping FTW).  GlassFart My intention with getting the Google Glass is to try it out and see if I can make anything really cool with the additional sensors and the fact that the device is worn on a person’s head. I was really struggling with what to start working on, and then it hit me: a fart app. I was actually working on a Dragonball Z Scouter app, but that was going to be too complicated. I found that you can insert your own “Okay Glass” prompts to start an app, so I figured I’d make a hello world fart app. The history of fart apps on advanced mobile operating systems is a long one, so I won’t go over all that. Suffice it to say I am proud to have written the first (as far as I know) native fart app for Google Glass. Here’s a video of me demonstrating it: Having played around with the GDK a bit, and the device a bit more, I am still not sure if I will keep it. The $1500 price tag is one factor. The public acceptance of the device is another. My opinions on my previous Glass post still hold. If anything, the opportunity is definitely worth the $1500 “loan” to Google plus return shipping. Contest Before I even got my first Google Glass invite, I went to a GDG Android meeting in Ann Arbor. The organizer had some spare Glass invites, so I asked for one. I hadn’t heard back about the invite, but after ordering my Glass from my original invites, I got another one from the GDG group’s pool. I figured I’d give it away, and to drum up interest in the fart app, I’m going to make a tweet and ask users to retweet it for a chance to win. To celebrate my Google Glass fart app, I'm running a contest to win a Glass invite! RT to enter, check http://t.co/vfT2UtsuSc for details. — Hung Truong (@hungtruong) December 6, 2013 Here’s some rules: Enter the contest by retweeting this tweet . You can only enter once per Twitter account. Don’t make multiple Twitter accounts to enter or you’ll be disqualified. The contest is for the invite code. You still have to buy the Glass yourself. The contest will end on Sunday, Dec 8th at 11:59PM ET. The contest winner will be chosen by random and will get a DM with the code (you should also follow me to make sure I can DM you). The invite code expires some time on Dec 10th, so you’ll have a couple of days to order it. I’m not liable for anything. Like if you’re mad about getting an invite and want to sue me or something. If no one enters I’ll probably just tweet out the code and the first person to use it gets it! Here are Google’s rule for eligibility: be U.S. residents be 18 years or older purchase Glass provide a U.S. shipping address OR pick up their Glass at one of our locations in New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles"

I was planning on reaching feature parity with the iOS app before releasing it, but I decided that a more frequent update cadence is probably better when it’s possible. The Google Play store makes it really easy to alpha and beta test, as well as promote beta builds to production. Rather than taking a week to find out that your app does not meet the requirements of Apple, you can simply push out a build and it’ll be ready in a few hours. This is probably one of the best “features” of being an Android developer. While Android has its fair share of “WTF” features, I actually kind of like it. I think it’s quickly getting to the point where Android’s advantages (amazing integration with very high quality Google products) will outweigh Apple’s (Super awesome third party applications albeit running in a tightly confined sandbox)."

        "content": "For the past few weeks, I’ve been learning Android and porting one of my iOS apps to the platform. While there are many differences between the two platforms, it’s also kind of interesting to see common design patterns between them. I figured I should write up the common design patterns that I notice and maybe help out some iOS developers who are also learning Android like me. Today I’ll look at doing asynchronous tasks in each platform. While there are many ways of doing this in both platforms, I’ll take a look at Dispatch Queues for iOS and AsyncTask in Android, since that’s what I’ve been using lately. In iOS, you can use the dispatch_async call to run code on a background dispatch queue . Say we get an NSArray of JSON objects and want to save them to a Core Data store. We can call dispatch_async on a dispatch queue, process all of the objects and then update the UI by using dispatch_async again on the main queue: NSArray *stuff = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:responseData ...]; dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ //if using core data, set up a new NSManagedObjectContext for this background thread for (id *obj in stuff) { //do time consuming work here } dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void){ //do stuff on UI, send notifications! [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@\"stuffHappenedNotification\" object:nil]; }); }); In Android, performing a lightweight asynchronous task requires you to subclass AsyncTask . I guess I’m using the term “lightweight” loosely because creating a subclass just to do something asynchronously seems a bit heavy, but at least you get to reuse your code! You must define three generic types which describe what the input is (in this example, a String), the progress type (an Integer) and a result (a Boolean). private class SomeBackgroundTask extends AsyncTask&lt;String, Integer, Boolean&gt; { @Override protected void onPreExecute() { //this is called first; you can use this to set up UI elements like a progress bar } @Override protected Boolean doInBackground(String... response) { JSONTokener tokenizer = new JSONTokener(response[0]); JSONArray stuff = new JSONArray(tokenizer); for(int i = 0; i &lt; root.length(); i++){ //do time consuming work here //the return type is Boolean, but it could really be anything we want //we can call publishProgress(Progress...) here to call the onProgressUpdate method below on the ui thread } return Boolean.TRUE; } @Override protected void onPostExecute(Boolean aBoolean) { //this is called with the result of doInBackground as a parameter. this method is also called on the ui thread } @Override protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer... progress) { //this is called from doInBackground with the function \"publishProgress(Progress...)\" //I use this method to send a local broadcast intent back to my main activity } } Once you have that AsyncTask set up, you can call new SomeBackgroundTask().execute(yourString); to run your asynchronous task. One tricky thing to remember is that execute takes a list of objects and sends it to doInBackground as an array. I’m not BFF with Java so the syntax threw me a bit, but apparently it’s using a feature called varargs that’s been in Java for a while now. That’s all for today. I hope this blog post was useful. I certainly found it useful, since I had to do some research to really understand what the heck I was writing about. I’ll probably write about UITableViewDelegate / Datasource vs. ListAdapter next, unless there’s something else that seems more timely."

I was able to successfully hook it up to my personal Google account, contrary to stuff I’ve read about the Explorer program not allowing loans, etc. If there’s a specific policy behind that, it doesn’t seem to be enforced on a technical level. Anyway, I figured I should write down some of my initial impressions on the thing. It’s always interesting to look back and see how well I did in my predictions, like when I thought Twitter was just for narcissists (not sure I was wrong on that one). The two strong feelings I have from Google Glass are that I wish it was less visible (to others) and I think it will greatly improve on video and photo sharing. While I understand that technology can work as a fashion accessory (see anyone who owns an iPhone), I also feel like it shouldn’t burden the user with its outward appearance. Everyone writes about how Google Glass will create some kind of panopticon state, but the one wearing them is really the one who feels watched. I once tried walking to get my mail while wearing the gadget, and felt super awkward as I said hi to a neighbor. The awkwardness could have also had something to do with the fact that I have to wear the Google Glass over my normal glasses, which looks super dumb. On a positive note, I think the ability to take first person videos is going to be the killer feature of Google Glass, if one ends up existing. I took a few videos of myself making dinner, which aren’t really that interesting now, but I can see a sort of lifestream genre bubble up from taking short videos of doing really mundane stuff day to day. Here’s a sample video I took: As far as developing for the Glass, I found that the Google Mirror API is a bit lacking if you don’t already have some existing app you’d like to integrate. It’s basically glorified push notifications with a few extra location features built in. As an Android noob, I haven’t really pushed anything interesting to the Glass device yet in terms of native apps (just the Hello World one and a few samples). I’d wait for the official GDK to start developing in earnest, and maybe in the meantime, learn Android. I had some mixed experiences with the Glass, overall. While the technology is neat, I feel there are many social hurdles that the device must pass before the thing can take off. Remember those Bluetooth headsets that you can wear on your ear? Google Glass is basically twice as useful, yet also twice as awkward. I think that a lot of the awkwardness will go away once sub-vocal microphone technology advances to the consumer level (think Metal Gear Solid). Then all Glass will need is a makeover to disguise the camera and screen into a normal set of glasses. Once the technology becomes outwardly invisible, the technology will be able to speak for itself. Until either the technology makes itself less conspicuous or society decides that it’s socially acceptable, Google Glass wearers will all look like this guy ."

There are times that I only played the big name games (like Grand Theft Auto and Skyrim) and basically ignored all the other smaller games. My interest in gaming ebbs and flows. I think that a few recent events have gotten me back into gaming fairly regularly. About a year ago I subscribed to PS Plus, which provides monthly installments of games for your PS3 and PS Vita/PSP if you have them. I was introduced to a bunch of cool games that I probably wouldn’t have bought otherwise like Saint’s Row 2, Borderlands. As a result, I ended up buying Saint’s Row 3 and Borderlands 2. It was also about a year ago that I built a PC for gaming. It’s kind of ridiculous how much cheaper it is to play games on a PC than to buy them for consoles. Plus, my PC has the added benefit of a better graphics card and more RAM (how the heck can the PS3 only have 256MB of RAM in the first place?). During the 2013 Steam Summer sale I went a little crazy and bought more games than I can possibly play. It’s just way too easy to buy them when they cost $5 or less and provide a lot of entertainment, even if they’re kinda old. I ended up buying Fallout New Vegas (the ultimate edition or whatever) even though I originally bought it for PS3. Luckily, it’s a lot faster and less buggy now. I’ve been playing a lot of video games in my free time for the past few months. While I sort of feel guilty that I should be working on web stuff or mobile stuff like side projects, I think it’s sort of necessary to avoid burnout. Plus I naturally tend to lose interest in games once I find a new piece of technology that I’m interested in learning."

I could either have a mediocre piece of code that sits around and keeps sucking, or I could post it to Github and anyone who wants to use it and possibly improve on it can. Not only does having code out there help your rep, but the act of putting it out there raises your standards quite a bit. What follows are a few projects I’ve posted on Github under “freeish” licenses. I don’t know too much about them, but a pal once told me that the MIT one is pretty open. Most of these are things I’ve used in my own code or things I used to learn a language (like the Chef recipe). I’ve learned to not care about perfection and just let people try it. I’m sure they’ll let me know if it sucks (especially if it hits Hacker News). ObjTweet  – a helper class for Twitter related stuff on iOS (now deprecated in favor of the official integration. LinkedIn Password Leak Checker – some people made a web based form version of this, which I thought was a really, really bad idea. Weathergram – an example of an “award winning” Twilio contest app. Some super low quality code here, folks. Google TTS CLI  – I wrote more about this Google hack here . Chef recipe for Duo Unix – I was learning Chef so I thought I’d make a recipe for a cool startup in town. Runscope iOS – This is a subclass of NSMutableURLRequest that makes it easy to use Runscope, which is a cool product for helping you analyze and debug API requests. These are mostly one-off simple hacks or convenience classes, so hopefully one of these days I’ll release something more substantial and open source it."

        "content": "When I was at my previous job, one task I had was localizing a large set of phrases to multiple languages, both in text and audio files. I did this by using the awesome Google Translate API . The Google Translate website has features for translating text and playing audio of it in the translated language. There’s no official API for getting audio, though. Luckily, I’ve never let a lack of an official API stop me before. I had read a few old blog posts about how Google’s undocumented TTS API could be used, albeit with a 100 character limit. Going over 100 characters would result in a truncated audio file. Some of the text I needed to output to audio was longer than that. It turns out that with a little bit of Chrome web inspector, I could replicate the functionality of the Google Translate site. The first thing to check out is the url scheme of the audio files, which looks like this: http://translate.google.com/translate_tts?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=hello%20world&amp;tl=en&amp;total=1&amp;idx=0&amp;textlen=11&amp;prev=input Breaking down the parameters, “ie” is the text’s encoding, “q” is the text to convert to audio, “tl” is the text language, “total” is the total number of chunks (more on that later), “idx” is which chunk we’re on, “textlen” is the length of the text in that chunk and “prev” is not really important. The Google Translate site itself gets around its own character limit by breaking big blocks of text into “chunks”. It seems to try and break along punctuation, but for super long sentences it will also break in the middle of a sentence, which ends up sounding pretty weird. Using the Gettysburg Address as an example, Google makes a request for the chunk “civil war”. In order to download audio files for longer chunks of text, I wrote up a python script that broke the text down and made separate requests to Google. The script would write all of the files to one file, and somehow, it worked! Just to be safe, I also set my script up to use Google’s Flash player as the referer (sic) and set the user agent to a version of Firefox. At the time, I didn’t want to release the code as it was being used for some uber top secret stuff. But since I’m not working on that project anymore, I refactored the original code into a command line Python script. Along the way I had to learn how to use Python’s argparse , which is a pretty neat way of parsing command line arguments. The project is available on Github right now, so go grab it and try it out . If you’re curious what the output sounds like, here’s a recording of female Abraham Lincoln reciting the Gettysburg Address (yes, she mispronounces some words). One fun thing to try out is outputting clashing input and output languages. Here’s Female Japanese Abraham Lincoln reciting the same speech (she just seems to be spelling words, slacker). If you enjoyed this hack, let me know and I could post some other ones I’ve been working on. And if you find a way to improve the code (probably not difficult at all) go ahead and submit a pull request on Github. And if you’re from Google, please don’t shut down my Gmail and Adsense accounts."

Google Reader is shutting down, apparently because its user base is shrinking and Google wants to focus on fewer products. Because of the huge void this will leave, many startups are rushing to fill the space that Google Reader took up. So far I’ve heard of plans from Digg, Flipboard, Zite (whatever that is), Feedly, and maybe some others. While this might be a good opportunity for those startups, it strikes me as odd. There’s a concept called being a “fast follower” where you copy some innovative company’s product immediately after they release it. Think of Facebook’s clone of that Snapchat app. What we’re seeing now is sort of the “slow(est) follow.” I suppose it makes sense to go into a space that you know is going to swell up with demand, but honestly, how much longer does the classic Google Reader style app have left? How much of the original Google Reader market are you going to get? Will you be able to re-create the community that the sharebros loved so much? On top of that, do any of these new products have a solid plan on monetization? To put it another way, what is the opportunity cost of rebuilding Google Reader (even if it’s a “reimagined” version) versus putting time into another product that might actually be new and useful? At this point, it’s probably not worth it considering how many others are eager to clone Reader."

Instead of using the normal Apple control, I’m using a custom overlay. Typically to do this, you do two things: set the UIImagePickerController’s “allowsEditing” to YES and add your overlay view to the controller’s “cameraOverlayView” view. Oh, and you also set the sourceType to UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera, obviously. I learned through searching about 10 StackOverflow questions and doing my own testing that the custom photo editing control only shows up when you show the normal apple camera controls. So unless you want to do some weird hacking to get your overlay to show up over the normal controls and then have them disappear when the photo is taken, it’s not possible to use a custom overlay and still get the built in photo editing tool. Unless someone wants to correct me… The annoying part is this is not captured in Apple’s official documentation (or anywhere, really). So hopefully this blog post helps someone who is trying to use a custom overlay and the built-in Apple photo cropping tool."

        "url": "/blog/2013/01/13/pharma-hack-update-finally-gone/",
        "content": "A good while ago, I wrote a blog post about how my blog was pharma hacked , and I thought I had gotten rid of it. I was actually extremely wrong, and it’s taken about half a year of off/on again fiddling to get rid of the infection for good. I thought I’d write up what I did in case anyone else has issues with this hack. In order to remove it, I tried searching for solutions from other bloggers. They got me to a certain point, but after following the directions and letting my blog sit for a week or so, I’d use the Google Webmasters feature to “fetch as Googlebot” and find that my site was reinfected. Here’s a step by step summary of what I had to do to finally get rid of the nasty pharma hack. I downloaded the latest tar.gz from WordPress here and extracted it to my root web directory. My blog lives in the subfolder “/blog/” so I just moved the wp-config.php file from /blog/ to the /wordpress directory, then I renamed the blog folder to something else and renamed wordpress to blog. I found that I’d also have to re-set the permalink settings to get pages besides my home page to show up correctly. My main mistake was copying the wp-contents subfolders back to the /blog/ directory. I assumed that the main infected file (wp-loads.php) was the only culprit. It turned out that I also had multiple php backdoors in my wp-contents directories, in /plugins, /themes, and even /uploads. I basically had to re-download anything in plugins and themes so that I knew those directories would be fresh. I ran a command to delete anything in /uploads that was a .php file, as that was how the backdoor worked. I believe it was something like find /path/to/uploads -name \"*.php\" | xargs rm but you probably want to double check that before running it on your server. I also noticed that some backdoors existed in the root of my web directory, where I keep my portfolio. If you have other directories besides your blog in your web root, it’s probably worthwhile to check those out. At this point I was pretty close to having a clean WordPress install. But for some reason my site would still eventually fall to the pharma hack. I checked my server logs and it looked like someone was modifying header.php in my theme directory from the admin panel. This was pretty surprising because I thought I had my password locked down pretty tight. I am actually still not sure whether the password was compromised, or some other feature in php (or a cookie) allowed the hacker to access the admin theme editor. Either way I’m pretty sure the header.php was hacked to write a new backdoor file which would then create other backdoors. Pretty smart! To fix this, I put another layer of security on my wp-admin directory with a .htaccess and .htpasswd file. I also updated my password to a 40 character random string that even I can’t remember. Finally, I just erased the file that does theme editing in the admin interface since I never use it and it seems like a really weak vulnerability. So far, the pharma hack hasn’t resurfaced and it’s been about two weeks. I’m going to say that I’m slightly confident it won’t return (unless there’s another vulnerability in WordPress that pops up). I feel like I learned quite a bit about security while playing whack-a-mole with this hack. I got to look at the backdoor files and figure out how they were hidden and obfuscated, and eventually found what I think was the root of the problem in the WordPress theme editor. I also hacked together some scripts to show recently modified files (hacked together from stuff I found doing some searches). If I end up getting hacked like this again, I’ll probably be able to remove it faster. For a while, I was considering moving to Jekyll for my blog. But that seemed like a bit too much work moving posts and comments, and learning a new blogging system, especially for how infrequently I blog nowadays. For now, I will stick with WordPress with all of its vulnerabilities, which have hopefully been mitigated with the few extra precautions I’ve added."

I might need to start up a series on my blog about weird dreams if this keeps up. There was a news story on AnnArbor.com yesterday about a local Ann Arbor guy appearing on Jeopardy that I tweeted from my parody account, so that’s probably what fueled this weird dream. For some reason I’m on the Jeopardy website, checking out the hall of fame. I vaguely recall having been on Jeopardy. This is cool because my old friend Susan was always trying to get onto Jeopardy and now I can brag to her that I was on it. I investigate further and realize that not only did I appear, but I won! My total winnings amounted to around $21,000 in June of 2011. At this point I’m wondering why I never got the check from Alex. The first thing I did was search for “jeopardy” in my gmail (this is also what I do in real life if I need to remember something). This was harder than I expected, because spelling “jeopardy” in a dream is harder than in real life. That only brought up two random emails, so I checked the hall of fame webpage again. It listed that my email address on file was “hungtron@gmail.com.” So apparently a typo was all that stood in the way of me and my prize money. The website had an email form to fill out (as well as a fax number) for corrections, etc. I didn’t really question why the public-facing website had so much information on it. As I raced to fill out my correct information “I regret to inform you that you have not paid me yet, and I am the Hung Truong who won back in 2011”, I woke up to the sobering reality that I was never a Jeopardy winner. That’s always the hardest moment. Realizing that you didn’t win at Jeopardy, don’t have an awesome dog, etc. sucks. But I guess I can take consolation in the fact that today is a new day where literally anything is possible (except for winning at Jeopardy, obviously)."

Some rights reserved by elana's pantry In the past, mashups were held to a pretty high opinion. The proper mashup might be able to take two things and simplify a process to critical acclaim. I think in those days, mashups weren’t thought of as startups or businesses, just small tools that people could use. Flash forward to today and sites like Mapskrieg and Padmapper (and others like AirBnB) are being C&amp;Ded for their terms of use violations. Something happened in the startup world that made mashups into a viable threat, which the bigger players did not approve of. While the term “mashup” seems a bit archaic now, I think it would be interesting to revisit that term and see what it means today. Take some pioneers of mashing up and some new startups and get them talking about stuff. Some rights reserved by 427 In other news, it looks like the Panel Picker requires some kind of “visual resource” like a video or slideshow or something. I don’t see how my proposal could be improved by that (it’s pretty cut and dry) so I’ll probably just link to this blog post and insert a lot of unrelated pictures of things being mashed up.

        "url": "/blog/2012/06/24/on-mapskrieg-and-craigslist-cease-and-desist-requests/",
        "content": "As I mentioned on Twitter a while back, I got a cease and desist request from craigslist a couple of weeks ago for Mapskrieg (my craigslist + Google Maps mashup for web and iOS). This request came at a pretty bad time (right before I was to move from Chicago to Ann Arbor). I quickly agreed to it and removed the app (I didn’t really have time or money to fight a lawsuit). I also added a passive-aggressive note on mapskrieg.com that you can still read if you’d like. I contacted a reporter at PandoDaily since I had seen a few other tweets about C&amp;Ds from craigslist. He proceeded to write a pretty badly researched article (he originally was going to post that I made housingmaps.com) that got very little attention. Fast forward to Friday and I got a tweet that Mapskrieg’s competitor, Padmapper , also got a C&amp;D. The internet erupts in anger and I realize that I forgot to write a eulogy for Mapskrieg! While I won’t get too deep into the politics of the current situation (I kinda think it’s like complaining about getting a speeding ticket after successfully speeding for 5 years without being caught), I will write a bit about Mapskrieg since it’s kind of a nostalgic topic for me. The success of Mapskrieg was largely an accident. It wasn’t born out of a desire to build a business or anything like that. I built it because 1) I had just been rejected for a job at Google and wanted to prove to them that I was a false negative and 2) I accepted an offer to go to Michigan for my Master’s degree and I needed to find a place to live. Mapskrieg killed two birds with one stone. While I had intended for Mapskrieg to simply show me apartment listings in Ann Arbor (something that housingmaps.com didn’t and still doesn’t do), I found that the scraper I wrote could just as easily apply to any of the other craigslist areas in the US and Canada. I decided to go large scale and slap some Google Adsense ads on there to help pay for the server. I sent a message to Mashable and they were nice enough to do a writeup of the service. This led to other stories from Lifehacker and other cool blogs. Apparently this bootstrapped Mapskrieg to the point where it had enough Google juice to show up in a lot of search engine results pages. I learned quite a lot about SEO and advertising from running Mapskrieg as a result. I won’t go too far in detail about how much it ended up making, but at one point it made enough to pay for my rent, which was pretty sweet. During grad school, I was too busy to add any improvements to Mapskrieg. After my first semester I realized that the page loads were getting slower and slower. Mapskrieg was slowly losing visitors. This was because I foolishly kept all listings in the database and pretty much never cleaned up or deleted old ones. The database got to millions and millions of rows or something equally ridiculous. I wrote a script that automated the process of pruning listings. Aside from a few random modifications (including porting Mapskrieg to Google App Engine, then reverting it), that was the last update I made to Mapskrieg. While Mapskrieg started to show its age (using technology from 2007 that I wrote when I was a noob), a new competitor came along that made it even more crappy looking: Padmapper. (This is starting to sound like some kind of History Channel documentary). While I could’ve attempted to go head on with Padmapper, I was instead having fun doing other projects like Troubadour Mobile and working at random places like Microsoft and Threadless. Mapskrieg was a really good source of passive income but I always figured that craigslist would contact me to have it taken down some day. I didn’t really want to put a lot of work into something that I had a feeling would eventually be sued. My hunch was correct as I got that cease and desist request last May. I’m sad to see craigslist taking this kind of action against Mapskrieg, Padmapper and other sites, but I can’t say it’s too surprising. Probably the most surprising part is how long it took them to actually do it. I don’t think these sites ever operated in some kind of legal gray area; they had always been violating terms. My personal defense is that Mapskrieg was always a search engine. If craigslist wants to order Mapskrieg to cease and desist, they should also order Google to do the same. Actually, maybe Google should take the initiative and remove craigslist from their search index preemptively. Mapskrieg holds a special place in my heart, partly because it was the one my biggest successes (so far). Also partly because the name is ridiculous. I have a feeling that putting Mapskrieg on my resume opened up doors that would’ve been closed to me otherwise. Mapskrieg did what it was supposed to do and never really evolved, but I never expected it to. If we can find a way to remember Mapskrieg in our hearts, then it will never truly be dead (plus I have a backup of it somewhere on another server). Mapskrieg: rest in peace. Born: May 6th, 2007. Died: May 21st, 2012. (P.S. If you’re interested in reading about how I made Mapskrieg, read this series of blog posts. It’s kind of an interesting look into the work ethic of 5-years-ago Hung): Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 Part 7 Part 8 Part 9 Part 10 Part 11 Part 12 Part 13"

While I enjoyed increasing my proficiency in Django and hanging out with cool co-workers, I found that I couldn’t break into areas that I was really interested in, specifically mobile. I decided to look for a new opportunity where I could grow as a mobile developer. I’m happy to announce that I’ve accepted a new gig with Canopy (whose name is going to change soon), a spinoff of a company called LanguageMate. Canopy is based in Ann Arbor and specializes in language applications for medical professionals. I’m working on a neat tool that helps nurses and doctors communicate with patients who might not speak the same language. I think it’s an interesting space and presents a lot of interesting challenges in interface design, marketing, end user support, and other aspects that revolve around mobile development. I believe this will be a better fit as I’m now able to work on a startup that is investing heavily in mobile. On top of that, I think it’s great that the app actually does something meaningful. Sure, a photo sharing app might sell for a billion dollars, but has it ever saved a person’s life? Right now I’m in the middle of another move. If all goes according to plan, I’ll be back in Ann Arbor (for the 4th time) on Friday. I’m looking forward to hanging out there again, spending more time with Emily, and eating at BTB every day. I am really thankful for all the friends I made at Threadless, and I feel bad leaving them so soon. Having said that, I am really looking forward to making a big impact at a small startup that really needs my skills. Here’s to an interesting second half of 2012!"

I recently took another look at it after it was renamed to “Google Play.” It’s suddenly making a bit more sense now that I’m trying it out again. Google Play (I’m really just talking about the music part) lets you upload all of your music to Google’s servers. This step seems kind of dumb but I guess for legal reasons they can’t just recognize your music and use their own copies of songs. I’m sure they’ve got the technology to do it. Anyway, once your music is uploaded you can play it from “the cloud.” While this seems like something so simple that Dropbox could do it, it’s the details that matter. In this case, Google offers a pretty neat interface to listen to your music (and buy more, if desired). I haven’t used iTunes Match personally, but from what I’ve read, it seems to do something similar. iTunes Match will scan your music library and “match” them up with songs in their database. If a song isn’t on your iPhone but is in your library, you can download and listen to it from your device. So far, it doesn’t seem like there’s a desktop component of iTunes Match besides iTunes (meaning you can’t listen from a website). Also, iTunes Match costs money. What I like about Google Play is that there is a web interface, so I can listen to all of my music at work without having to download iTunes. I complained earlier on Twitter about how there isn’t a native app for iOS that lets you listen to your Google Play stuff, but there does happen to be a web based player that seems okay. iTunes integrates more easily with your library (no need to actually upload stuff) but seems more rigid about re-downloading music. Overall, it seems like Google Play is the better service. If it had a native app for iOS it would be the clear winner. Eventually I would like to lower the amount of space on my phone that I’m using for music, which would allow me to have more apps, photos and videos. Hopefully the two services continue to develop and compete with each other to the point where they’re both improving."

There were two nice sales people (one lady and one dude) who were hawking cereal. The type of cereal was super organic and it came in a pouch. The lady bragged that all of the ingredients were on the front of the bag in large type. The cereal was available for testing in cereal form, baked into a cookie, and blended into a smoothie (which was apparently made with apple cider and yogurt or something). Sidenote: While I was deciding what to taste test (I eventually went with the smoothie and it was not bad, and followed up with a chunk of cookie), an old Asian lady walked up to me and started talking in Chinese. I tried to tell her that I don’t really speak Chinese, but I forgot how to say “I don’t know Chinese” in Chinese. It’s kind of absurd, anyway, to say you don’t speak a language in that very language you’re saying you don’t speak. Anyway, she mumbled some more stuff and then said “Chinese.” Like, yeah, lady, we’re both Chinese. I guess she walked away after that. So anyway, here’s the real part of the story. I’m tasting the cookie and am about to leave when another woman walks up to the food tasting area. The sales guy asks if she wants to buy some cereal and she’s like “oh, I already have some at home! I love it! I’m just going to have some samples.” And they get into this conversation about how great the cereal is. I caught some more of their conversation as I walked away. Only later did I realize that the cereal-praising lady was probably a shill ! It was literally the oldest sales trick in the book! I mean, no one gets that excited over cereal, right? She was really into it; a little too much into it to be believable. Perhaps I am just cynical, but I would love to hang around Whole Foods to see if the same lady came over and did that multiple times. The sad part is that I can see the shill bit working on quite a lot of people. It probably didn’t work on the Chinese lady, though. She didn’t speak English."

Perhaps I am being cynical, but it’s always appeared to me that the main business model of a textbook publisher is to slightly tweak versions of a textbook, altering page numbers and quiz questions in order to force students to buy newer editions instead of used ones. Perhaps the industry is thinking that iBooks will eliminate the used book market, and they’re probably right. But this could also have some negative (for publishers) side effects as well. Apple is lowering the distribution costs of textbooks dramatically. Assuming that schools actually pay for a set of iPads for each student, it becomes trivially easy (with the iBook publishing software) to create free textbooks for schools. Who would want to give textbooks away for free? Teachers. There are cases of teachers self-publishing for their own schools, but for this idea to really work, I think teachers would need to collaboratively create a textbook that meets either regional or national standards and release it for free on iBooks. If you don’t believe this will happen, take a look at Khan Academy . Previous attempts to create free textbooks have been hit or miss. I am not quite sure how popular Wikibooks are in the classroom. The problem is probably that of traction and scale. Previously, no one has created a standard for e-textbook distribution. Apple is doing that with iBooks. The beautiful part is that they’re bootstrapping it with traditional publishers who are probably digging their own grave. Of course, this could play out in a number of ways. Maybe iBooks will prove to be too costly for most public schools to adopt (I’m guessing this is very likely). If only private schools or schools with a lot of funding can support them, it may not become worthwhile to create free textbooks for all. What I’d hope to see is a slow adoption of iPads in the classroom using iBooks as textbooks. Once a critical mass of schools is using iBooks, free textbooks will be developed and adopted by certain school districts and spread to others. I’m glad to see that Apple is trying to “disrupt” (I lose some points here by using a word I hate) the textbook industry, and it’s awesome that they’re partnering with that industry to do it. I’m really looking forward to seeing how this plays out, hopefully for the benefit of our education system."

        "content": "Last year I wrote a review of the stuff I had accomplished in 2010 . It was useful for me to look back and realize that even though I felt I hadn’t accomplished much, I really had. I figure I should do the same this year, so here’s what I did in 2011. January was a pretty big month for me. I had entered my apps into a University of Michigan contest and Checkmate ended up winning 3rd place . I also “released” Instascriber , which got picked up on a couple of tech news sites, including LifeHacker . At the end of January, I socially engineered a Facebook poll to virally get around 60,000 responses before Facebook shut it down . That was pretty fun. February was a bit slower. I think I mostly ported Mapskrieg to App Engine (though I since reverted it back to the PHP version since App Engine raised their prices like crazy). I think I also interviewed at a couple of places for jobs, but didn’t have any sustained interest from anyone (or with anyone, really). I must have spent most of March doing iOS programming, because the only blog posts I have are the one about UISplitViewController and the release of &lt;3 Threadless for iPad . The iPad app release was pretty big for me since I had not previously released an iPad app that was much more than a simple scrollview with a main view attached. In April, I released another iPad app, Mapskrieg . This was a really good way for me to get better with iOS development and to write my own API to use in the app. I believe April is also when I started interviewing for other jobs, including one at Bebarang. I also started working on a freelance app for the University’s Enriching Scholarship event. I guess I never announced it on my blog previously, but here’s the app I worked on . In May, I started working with Allen Kim on Bebarang, the Netflix for baby clothes. I moved to New York in June , and stayed there to work on the startup for July and August as well. My summer experience deserves a blog post of its own, which I started writing and sorta forgot about. It was really awesome getting mentorship on the ins and outs of starting a business. I got to meet lots of incredible people and learned a ton. I also got to eat some really good food and experience New York. I am super grateful for the opportunity to work with NYC Seedstart and Bebarang. Unfortunately, things just didn’t work out, and I left the company at the end of August. In September, I noticed a job posting at Threadless, and contacted my pal Chris about it. I attended the Threadless Family Reunion and got a job offer that I couldn’t refuse ! I moved to Chicago (actually a suburb of it, Oak Park) in October and I am currently working on cool things at Threadless , including an awesome looking redesign of the site. So far I have learned a ton about actual software engineering (as opposed to the cowboy coding that I’m accustomed to). It is majorly sweet that I’m getting paid to get better at Django and Python (oh, and contribute to the code base, of course). I really couldn’t ask for a better turn of events than to work at a company I’ve long admired (and bought from). In December, I took a trip to California to hang out with my family (much of whom also traveled to California to hang out). I went to the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot but forgot my fucking bumpersticker!!!! I am really pissed about that. I discovered that my niece and nephew really like Minecraft, and I think I will write a separate blog post about that. Looking back, I feel I got a lot accomplished in 2011. I think I finally found a good balance between doing whatever the heck I want (and getting paid little) and being a complete corporate slave (and getting paid slightly better). I learned that maybe being a startup founder is not for me (at least in this stage of my life). I want to make an impact in whichever field I work in. I’m still figuring out how to maximize that (while still enjoying life and hanging out with other people, like my girlfriend). I feel like I am finally at the point where my hard work and accumulation of experience have paid their dividends, and it is now up to me to continue working hard and improving every day. I think my greatest concern for 2012 is that I won’t accomplish as much as I have in previous years. Working a full time job can be hard on side projects, so I’ll try to put in a good effort on keeping those and my hobbies alive. I also want to work on my health, as living in New York and eating all of its food has added a few pounds. I started playing DDR again. It’s fun. I have a few ideas for side projects that I’d like to work on. One is an open source ifttt clone that anyone can install (on their own server) and write modules for. Another is a redesign of Anime Nano (and maybe a rewrite in Django). I also want to get an aluminum base plate and photopolymer plates made for my letterpress. Finally, I would like to blog more often; shorter blogs, longer blogs, blogs about wacky stuff that I experience. I want to look back to this blog post in a year, and hopefully I’ll have accomplished many or all of my “resolutions” by then."

I never get a chance to do the cool stuff you’re supposed to do in a dream when you know what’s going on (like fly and whatnot). Last night, I did end up having a lucid dream of sorts. I was walking around a house when I realized I was dreaming. I read somewhere that you can spin around really fast, and apparently that helps you stay in the dream and not wake up when you realize you’re dreaming. I did this and was able to stay in the dream. After that, I walked through the house some more and looked at the furnishings, thinking that I have a pretty cool brain for being able to invent that stuff on the fly. Like, “wow, my mind just made up that sofa arrangement.” At this point, I decided to do something more fun. I tried moving parts of the house around with my mind, and see if I could demolish it. It didn’t work. Once I wasn’t able to control the dream, I woke up. After I woke up, I decided I would try to go back to sleep and dream the same dream. I wasn’t quite able to do this, though, because I was still dreaming! What I thought was a lucid dream was really me dreaming that I was lucid dreaming. I think this is the first case I can remember of having a dream inside of a dream. I’m pretty sure I was dreaming that I woke up, because I can recall actually waking up and it being quite different from my dream waking up. I think it’s kind of interesting that I was able to keep dreaming even though I realized I was in a dream partially due to the fact that I was dreaming of dreaming. The complexity of dreams continues to surprise and confuse me. Hopefully I am writing this blog post in a non-dream, because I’d really like to have a record of this dream in a dream."

        "content": "I read a tweet from someone a while back about how they used Google Adwords to max out their Dropbox referral disk space. I thought this was a clever hack and decided to try it for myself. I made a new Adwords account and entered a coupon code from Dreamhost for $75 in free Adwords money. I ran into a few issues with my first ads. They were running okay in the beginning, but were getting shot down in the review process for trademark issues. I couldn’t figure out why this was the case, since I had seen multiple blog posts describing how to set up the ads with no mention of trademark issues. I tried a few tweaks, and removed “Mac” from the copy of my ads, thinking that the word might have triggered the trademark issue. The first set of ads without “Mac” in them ended up getting approved, and I was on the fast track to Dropbox space gluttony. Here’s a screenshot of what my campaign looked like (until I stopped it because I maxed out on referrals): Things looked like smooth sailing and I think I only used something like $20 worth of credit (though I could’ve easily optimized for spend, I kinda wanted to finish more quickly, so I set my cpcs aggressively). I was gonna change the ads and open it up for friends to get referral space, too. Then yesterday, with no warning, I got an email that my account had been suspended. There wasn’t really any good explanation for this. When I look at my account, it says: Your Google AdWords account has been permanently suspended for repeated violation of AdWords or Landing Page and Site policies in this or a related account. and Your Google AdWords account has been permanently suspended because your billing information in this or a related account could not be verified. I’m not sure I could come up with a more vague message. So far, Google Adwords email support has been of no use at all. I first got an email saying they were “escalating” the matter, which probably just means they didn’t get around to it within 24 hours so they had to send something, then I got a generic form email saying that: After reviewing your account, it has come to our attention that your Google AdWords accounts do not comply with our Terms and Conditions. As a result, your account, and any related accounts you may have created, have been suspended, and your ads will no longer run on Google. Well no shit, that really doesn’t tell me anything new! The best tidbit of the email was that: – For privacy reasons, AdWords Support is unable to provide any additional information regarding this account. You know, in case I find something out about myself that I didn’t know… It’s my account! If I did something wrong to get banned, I sure would like to know why. Since I don’t, I feel like I’m in the customer support limbo that is synonymous with “Google Support” which is already an oxymoron of sorts. Anyway, TL;DR I used Adwords to max out my Dropbox referrals like many have before, got the banhammer from Google and now their customer support is atrocious (as expected)."

I’ve noticed a whole lot of ticker updates since then from my friends’ playlists. I decided I would have some fun with the Ticker feature, so I went on Spotify and made a playlist of just “Never Gonna Give You Up.” At first I thought it had not worked, but it looks like my friends are now all aware of my favorite song in the world. I mostly mess with Facebook to point out unintended consequences of their design decisions. In this case, something passive like listening to music overpowers stuff that might actually be interesting, like a comment or a post. I wonder if Facebook will change their ticker behavior, or continue to allow it to be used for a “firehose” of info while the news feed will be used for more interesting/important stuff."

        "content": "This past weekend I participated in my first NYC hackathon. The New York Hackathon is a mythical beast. They’ve been written about quite extensively, but you really need to just show up to one to know what it’s all about. This particular hackathon ( Photo Hack Day ) was organized by Aviary, with sponsorships by Bing, Pepsi, PBR and others. There was plenty of food so that hackers didn’t have an excuse to leave, ever. I still ended up going home to get some sleep on Saturday night before the demo on Sunday. I really think I picked a good first hackathon to attend, as the prizes were pretty insane. First place got $5000 and the cash prizes for second and third place were quite good as well. On top of those, there were prizes for best use of certain APIs. Face.com’s API stood out as a popular one; 500px had quite a few users as well. I ended up working on a project I had wanted to build for a while: a custom collage creator for your iPhone wallpaper. I called it “AllPaper.” It seemed pretty catchy and I don’t think there’s a product with that name yet. I integrated Instagram into it first, then threw support for 500px, PicPlz and Facebook before calling it a hack. I also integrated the Sincerely Ship Library which lets you turn your collage into a real postcard. I’m really looking forward to trying that out! Overall I’m pretty happy with how the hack turned out. I can probably turn it into a real app fairly easily with some tweaking here and there. As this was my first hackathon, I noticed a few interesting things about the top hacks. There was some grumbling about how many of them seemed “hardcoded.” I wonder if presentation really counts more than actual hack-worthiness these days. You could spend your time actually coding something, or you could create the facade of something that looks even better, but is not really that worthy of being called a “hack.” It seems that the presentation wins over the true hack-worthiness, as one of the cooler ones, a jailbroken iPhone that took MMS messages and uploaded them to a web service, won nothing. Coming away empty-handed was a little damaging to the ego, especially after winning something in my last hackathon , but my ego’s not too bruised. I hate to sound like I’m complaining! Almost all of the presentations were well done, and the winners certainly did deserve to win. I’m hoping to participate in something similar again soon, as the atmosphere was really enjoyable."

        "content": "I was lucky enough to get an early invite to Spotify last week thanks to my high Klout score (I honestly think anyone with a pulse got an invite) and I’ve been playing around with it for a few days. Here’s my thoughts on the service thus far. One thing I’ve noticed is that I’m using Spotify for listening to stuff that I don’t already have in my library. This is sort of weird because I recently switched to an SSD and none of my music is actually in my library. Yet I use Spotify for listening to stuff that’s not on my external hard drive (which I almost never have plugged in). I think this behavior might be due to the fact that Spotify is making me a fat kid in a candy store (but for music). I want to keep searching to test Spotify’s limits and see how much music it really has. So far it’s been doing really well. Specifically, I have been using Spotify mostly to listen to music that was popular when I was in middle school (this was like, 14 years ago). This music is stuff that I’m either too embarrassed to have on my hard drive, or I simply never had. Yet it’s totally great for nostalgia’s sake. I’ve been listening to No Doubt, Toni Braxton, Weezer, Mariah Carey, etc. Stuff that brings me back to that era. It’s pretty cool. One workflow that Spotify has replaced for me is the awkward one of going to YouTube and looking for a video of a song I want to hear. I don’t know how many times I’ve had to go to YouTube and searched for something like “ Head Over Heels ” by Tears For Fears just to listen to a song (it’s just a static image of the album cover). It’s much, much quicker just to search in Spotify and get super instant gratification. Comparisons to the new hot startup, Turntable , are pretty much impossible to avoid. Turntable is really fun for interacting with people (and music discovery), but sometimes you just want to listen to what you want to listen to (and not wait for other DJs before your song comes on). I think the two services have very different use cases, and each works well for its intended use. One thing Spotify could work on is music discovery. It’s kind of ridiculous the only music it pushes are the top albums, artists and songs. All the stuff on this list are top 20 bullshit that I really have no interest in listening to (just ignore the top 20 “bullshit” from the 90’s that I just admitted to listening to). In this day and age, it’s ridiculous for a music service to not include some kind of recommendation engine or radio feature. Browsing music on the service by genre, year or anything besides search is impossible. In terms of features, Spotify is actually kind of disappointing. Despite the obvious shortcomings, I have a lot of high hopes for Spotify. It’s a really nice example of how consumers can enjoy getting stuff from “the cloud” without making it too complicated. I hope that it continues to improve, especially in the music discovery and browsing categories."

Besides the fact that I hadn’t requested it (lots of Hung Truongs think that they’re me @ gmail), I was surprised because any company that even slightly values security does not store passwords in plain text. It is quite jarring to see a password show up on my iPhone’s home screen. Here’s the email in case anyone needs proof: The fact that BR stores passwords in plain text means that they’re probably a very nice target for a quick hack (and if they’ve got bad practices in password storage, they probably have holes elsewhere as well). Unlike the Gawker password leak, which had hashed passwords (though they could still be eventually brute-forced), the BR passwords aren’t even obfuscated (or if they are, it’s in an easily reversible way). If you have a Banana Republic, Gap, Old Navy, Piperlime or Athela account, I highly suggest you change your password to something unique that you don’t use for any other sites (um, just like all your passwords… I totally have different passwords and two-factor security for everything). I’d also suggest you contact Banana Republic and tell them that their security policies suck. Maybe they’ll fix it if enough people complain. That’d be sad if it took a huge hack and user info disclosure to change their ways."

So far, we’ve probably pivoted about 2 times, and we’re not even at the halfway point yet! The support from mentorships has been really helpful in understanding what startups really need to focus on to be successful. Without a market, there’s no company. Without the proper product to market fit, there’s no company. And if everything fits perfectly, you still need to be able to scale your service or product to meet demand! Approaching a startup in a semi-scientific way is also very cool. Instead of looking at a startup as an ultra risky venture, you’re really looking for ways to prove hypotheses and make the thing as un-risky as possible while maximizing the potential upsides. Bebarang is chugging along and I hope to provide an actual launch post some time soon (in private beta, of course)."

The simple pitch is that we’re trying to solve the problem of babies growing out of their clothes all the time. We’re still figuring out the details. I am super excited (and lucky) to be part of another entrepreneurial incubator program. I gained a whole lot from the awesomeness of RPM10 , and I hope the same will be true for NYC SeedStart. My partner, Allen, is super sharp and I think we’ll end up getting a lot of stuff done between the two of us. Regardless if we exit at $100 billion (or settle for a $50 billion exit), I’m looking forward to living in a new city, getting to know the tech scene and building up a company once again.

        "content": "I read a blog post about Engineers and Delayed Gratification a while ago from ex-Googler and ex-Microsoftie Ninane Wang that made me think. She says that new engineers (like straight from school) have a hard time adjusting to the real world because they expect to be rewarded immediately for their work. In the real world, you don’t see rewards for your work for months, or even years! Her solution is to have managers provide instant feedback to their reports so they get at least some acknowledgment of their work. Since quitting Microsoft and setting out on my own (and even before that), I’ve had to trust that the stuff I am working on is meaningful and worthwhile. This is hard sometimes, especially if the thing I’m working on seems like a gamble. Having done the whole independent hacking thing for a while, I think I’ve built up the rolling reward cycle that Niniane mentions. Some days I’ll feel like I’m underachieving or working on something that no one will find useful. Then I’ll get a donation from someone for Instascriber (this actually happened!!!) or see another 5 star review for my Threadless app and get re-encouraged. At the end of the day, I think what really separates the employees from the entrepreneurs is the willingness to be unsure about something and still do it. The uncertainty is much greater when you’re working on an unproven idea, business model, or whatever, but then so are the potential rewards, too. And even if you end up failing, you learn something and are better for it . In some ways, delaying gratification even sort of makes sense. If you immediately were rewarded for doing something innovative, you might lose the passion (like Rocky did) and stop innovating so you can enjoy your riches. While I can’t say that delaying gratification indefinitely would be a good idea, accepting that there will be a delay is probably healthy."

My websites did not manage to dodge all of the bullets either. A few sites were down from the Media Temple thing. I also inadvertently broke a few sites here and there. After the Media Temple downtime, I wanted to try updating a few Ruby Gems to get Passenger Phusion working.

I was also surprised to see Mapskrieg going down late last week. Apparently I hadn’t verified the domain for Google Apps and Google decided to close my account. The one that was serving Mapskrieg via App Engine. This was really annoying since all of the “act now or we’ll delete your account” emails were classified as spam in gmail and I am pretty sure I had verified the account previously. If Google doesn’t want my money then screw them. I figure I can actually serve the site for cheaper than App Engine since a few other apps live on the same server. The App Engine thing was a fun experiment but there are still too many limitations in the datastore to base a real app on it. Specifically, datastore writes cost way too much and indexes take way too much overhead in disk space (which you eventually need to pay for). So now I’m back to running most sites on Media Temple, though I may diversify in case Media Temple continues to have downtime issues. It was a stressful few days, but at least I got to practice my sysadmin skills a bit and update my server in the process."

        "content": "It’s been about 4 years since I announced the launch of Mapskrieg , my Google Maps and craigslist mashup web app. Since then, I’ve gone to school (again), worked for Microsoft and quit, and made a few apps. Today, I’m happy to announce the launch of my newest app, Mapskrieg for iOS ! I’ve been working on this app for a few weeks, and I think it’s ready for public consumption. It’s basically Mapskrieg , but developed natively for the iPhone and iPad. In the past, I’ve taken a sort of iterative approach of releasing fairly minimal apps and improving on them. For example, I released Threadless as an iPhone only app and later added the iPad support. I wanted to release Mapskrieg on both platforms so the launch would have a little more bang. Plus I think the iPad app is the better of the two, and I really wanted that one to stand out for the release. I’ve been getting much more comfortable with mobile development, and I’m very happy with the rate at which I was able to conceive and release this app. That’s not to say I didn’t struggle or learn anything new with it. While a lot of the concepts are borrowed from my Threadless iPad app, I had to do a lot of stuff I hadn’t done before. For example, since Mapskrieg is going to rely on iAds to make money, I decided that both the iPad and iPhone versions would support iAd. Apple, in their infinite wisdom, made the split view controller a very useful and now, standard, design paradigm. Unfortunately, they don’t provide any support for using it with iAd at all. What the fucking fuck, Apple!? So I had to basically recreate the Split View (well, the landscape mode at least) in order to support iAds. It’ll be well worth it if I can rake in some iAd dough, though! This post also comes almost 1 year after I quit my job at Microsoft. That milestone probably deserves its own post, but I’ll just say that I have not yet regretted my decision in the very least so far. This is as fun as it gets, folks!"

        "content": "In the beginning of February this year there was some mild uproar about Google setting up an elaborate sting operation against Bing to prove that Bing was copying search results pages directly from Google using the Bing Toolbar. I personally thought it was a bit childish of Google to do this. All’s fair in gathering user-generated data, right? Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I put some code on Mapskrieg that would auto-detect a mobile device using the useragent string and show a mobile friendly site. I thought this was clever, but apparently Google thought it was cloaking. Oops! My bad. I took a hit on my Google search rankings. Once I fixed the issue my hits from Google have been coming back up slowly. I looked at Google Analytics to see how the organic search referrals had changed, and I noticed something interesting. Not only had the referrals from Google gone down, the ones from Yahoo and Bing did as well. Perhaps Yahoo and Bing noticed the “cloaking” behavior, too (Yahoo is just using Bing results in their SERPs now). If so, then Bing was a bit slower than Google. See the charts below: I started getting punished by Google around the 15th of March. Bing seems to have taken a few days to lower my rankings (and thus the # of clicks). My website’s recovery from punishment shows a similar upward trend, even though the site was no longer “cloaking” for about a week before that recovery. This suggests (at least, to me) that Bing really is copying Google’s search results pages. Otherwise they have a very similar method of cloaking detection, a similar policy for punishment, and a similar timeline for reducing the punishment for cloaking… At this point I feel that there are too many coincidences for this to be mere chance. I was previously on Bing’s side because I figured that the Google data was just one data point out of many that they use. This example makes it seem like Google’s data is THE data point, or at least a major, major part of their “algorithm.” Having stated all of this, my experience is only a sample size of 1, but I’m sure other webmasters have similar data sitting around. I’d be interested in seeing if there’s more evidence for Google’s stance. If I were Google, I’d be analyzing data from Google Analytics on other websites to see if they agree (I have a feeling they’re allowed to use this data anonymously). Full Disclosure (because why not?): I used to work for Microsoft AdCenter, but I haven’t been involved with their operations for over a year now. I have a can of Bing soda water on my shelf but I mostly use Google (unless I want to use Bing ironically). Edit: I’ve gotten some really great comments from Hacker News. I thought I’d paraphrase a few and write my comments on them. If you want to see the actual comments, go directly to my submission . Comment : How could Bing get SERP info from just the toolbar? My response : 1) My site drops from many SERP listings, Bing Toolbar stops getting click info for my site so the listings drop from Bing as well. Comment : It might not be cloaking punishment. It could just be an outside factor, like people generally searching for the site’s keywords less or a competitor coming in and being better. My response : The traffic to Mapskrieg is pretty darn regular and this was a significant drop for both search engines. Through trial and error the only thing that changed my rankings back was fixing the user agent thing. Comment : Google suggested that the changes to SERPs took months to propagate and this data only took about a day. My response : Okay, that’s a good point! The response from Hacker News has been great and really made me think more about the issue. I’m not sure if Bing really is copying from Google, but I thought this was a worthwhile data point to look at. Maybe someone else has some data they’d like to share as well."

        "content": "About a week ago I thought about working some more on ♥s Threadless, my fan made iPhone app. I originally designed it for the small iOS devices like the iPhone and iPod touch, and figured I would do the proper iPad version later. I got the itch, so I got to work figuring out what an app on the bigger screen would look like. I knew that I wanted a grid-y layout as opposed to the list-y one of the iPhone/iPod, which was partly the reason why I hadn’t done the iPad version yet. Lists on iOS are easy because they’re given to you for free. Grids are a whole other beast. Luckily, I ran into a framework ( AQGridView ) on GitHub that does grid layouts in a tableview-y sort of paradigm. The framework was still a little beta (or alpha) as I had to go in and change a few things that were crashing, but it did succeed in making my job a lot easier overall. I’d like to try contributing to that code to improve it, but I guess that’s another post altogether. After getting the grid stuff working, I decided to use a modal pop up view to display the images and sharing options all in one view. Since the iPad has much more screen real estate, it’s easy to design things without running into space issues. You don’t, however, want to just stick a billion buttons in because you can. I think this design does a good job of showing enough stuff to the user, but not too much stuff too soon. I still have some bugs to fix, mainly with memory management due to the grid view stuff. If you have any suggestions, feel free to comment on this blog! Hopefully the iPad app continues the mission of the iPhone app, which is to provide a really easy and fun way to browse and share awesome Threadless designs! I may have been an early iPad doubter, but I really believe that it’s a great device for consuming content. Even on my iPad 1, the designs and colors just pop on the app. At least I think so. But you don’t have to take my word for it! Get the app if you don’t have it already !"

Most of the time, UISplitViewController doesn’t want to rotate because you didn’t set it as the root subview of the Window. This is pretty well documented on StackOverflow, etc. I thought this was why my splitviewblahblahblah wasn’t rotating. It turns out that, according to Apple’s documentation, A split view controller relies on its two view controllers to determine whether interface orientation changes should be made. If one or both of the view controllers do not support the new orientation, no change is made. This is true even in portrait mode, where the first view controller is not displayed. Therefore, you must override the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method for both view controllers and return YES for all supported orientations. The key here is that the view controller wasn’t autorotating because the subviews did not answer “YES!!!” (exclamation points added by me) to shouldAutoRotateToInterfaceOrientation. I was fucking around with the Split View Controller in Interface Builder (and later programmatically) to no avail. Adding the stupid autorotate thing to yes in the subviews made it work (shouldn’t it default to YES!?!??!). Okay, lesson learned. Just don’t forget this next time, Hung!"

        "content": "Lately I’ve been playing around a lot with Google App Engine. I think it’s finally at a point where it makes sense to develop for it, and it can be fun and profitable to do so. For example, I wrote Instascriber on App Engine, and so far it has cost me a few pennies in CPU cycles (and like $2 for a domain name or something). Playing around with memcaching and stuff with Instascriber has led me to become a little obsessed with efficiency (not that I wasn’t already). I took a look at Mapskrieg and found that it was performing pretty slowly. My Google Webmaster Tools thing was saying it took on average 6-8 seconds to load! I wanted to decrease that number, and I figured I could make it work on App Engine, so I started working on it last week. I modified the parser I use to grab craigslist listings to also send them to Mapskrieg. Then I basically rewrote all of the logic that existed in PHP and ported it over to App Engine. This took a little while but it wasn’t too difficult since Mapskrieg is a pretty simple web app. I hardly changed any code in the Maps API implementation, though I’m thinking of moving to v3 (which is apparently supposed to be faster). I just switched out the hosting from my MediaTemple PHP based host to the Google App Engine based one. So far the results look good. I think Mapskrieg is faster in terms of response time and the caching is definitely smarter than it was before (a memcache that only gets cleared when the content in it changes versus a time based cache expiration). I’m going to watch closely to make sure nothing got borked in the transition, but so far so good. If I can keep Mapskrieg on App Engine, I might downgrade the MediaTemple server to save some money and maybe eventually move other services to App Engine as well. One funny thing I noticed was the pricing plan for App Engine. I’m currently pruning listings from the database when they get too old or move past the limit of listings per listing type (because I’ll never show them). This is actually older behavior from when I had listing info in MySQL. Back then, the size of the database would affect the performance of selecting rows. Google’s datastore apparently does not get slower with respect to size. This is actually pretty awesome. The weird thing is that adding and removing datastore objects costs quite a lot in CPU time. Additional CPU time past 6.5 hours is $.10 an hour. Storage, on the other hand, is .$01 per 2 gigabytes per day. From my usage, I am predicting that the CPU cycles that I would use to trim the datastore listings would actually cost more than just leaving them in the datastore and paying for storage. Is that insane or what? I still have to test some things out, but it kind of surprises me that storage would be that much cheaper than the CPU cycles to remove something."

Unlike many programming challenges, the problems in this one were pretty easy to solve. I think a lot of people on Hacker News complained that you could basically brute force them into submission. For example, one question is finding a prime Fibonacci number. I’m sure there’s super smart ways to do it but I just iterated through Fibs and then ran a really slow primeness function on each one. It worked eventually! I finished the challenge and sent an email to the Greplin guys, since the challenge instructed me to do so. After reading through some of their site, the challenge actually started to make more sense to me. From their jobs page : You should know the fastest way to do something – which sometimes means the least CPU cycles and sometimes means the least programmer cycles. Basically, you could figure out the most efficient way to do the challenges (from a computational perspective) at a cost to programming time. Or you could recognize that N was trivially large for all of the challenge cases and just code something really simple up and get the answer. I picked the latter. Greplin is probably looking for both types, so I think they did a good job designing the challenge. In other news, I signed up for their service and tried it out. It seems like a really cool concept and I like it so far. I kind of wish there was a roll your own version though. I dunno if I can trust Greplin with all of my innermost secrets… It’s bad enough that Google has all of your email; Greplin can have that plus your tweets and Facebook stuff too!"

        "content": "About two weeks ago I updated one of my apps to use AdMob mobile ads when iAd fails to deliver (pretty damn often). Instead of swapping out iAd for AdMob, I use the iAd “didFailToReceiveAdWithError” delegate method to request an AdMob ad when iAd fails. This means that AdMob shouldn’t take any income away from iAd, but only supplement it. I thought I’d take a look at the stats and compare the performance of the two ad networks on my app. (The following numbers I’m referring to are from the time period from 1/25 to 2/7) For an idea of scale, my app, Anime Nano , gets about 600 iAd requests per day. My app analytics software (Flurry) is saying I’m getting about 600 sessions per day. The thing is that about 1/5 of those sessions are on the iPad (and I haven’t enabled iAd on the iPad yet), so I think that on average, the iPhone apps are making a little more than one iAd request per session. Despite the fairly healthy rate of requests that I’m getting, iAds are only getting sent about 15% of the time. This percentage is what’s known as the “fill rate.” This is also what most developers complain about being too low. The clickthrough rate is actually pretty good at 0.81%. When iAd fails to deliver (85% of the time), I fall back to AdMob. The fill rate for AdMob is a high 88%, though the past few days it’s been closer to 99%. The CTR, however, is a fairly low 0.25%, which is less than half of iAd. This is partly due to the fact that AdMob ads refresh more often, so the number of impressions is higher. I’m going to describe my revenue in terms of percentages here since ad platforms typically don’t like it when publishers publish their income. Not sure if that’s changed lately, but whatever! In the time period from 1/25/2011 to 2/7/2011, I made 2.3x more with iAd than AdMob, even with the super low fill rate (and impressions) of iAd. This is pretty interesting since iAd only shows up 15% of the time. There were actually a few days where AdMob beat iAd, but there were a couple of days where iAd made a killing (relatively), probably from those super awesome interactive ads which I still haven’t experienced firsthand yet. For now, I’m content with the fill rate of AdMob, though it sort of pains me to see such a low click rate and revenue per click. Something tells me that if AdMob worked harder at increasing ad quality (like iAd), they’d be able to charge more and their advertisers would probably see a better return on investment. Most of the advertisers don’t even bother to use an image ad, which I assume would increase the clickthrough rate. I noticed something really strange when looking at ads on my app. There’s no way for advertisers to disable ads on devices that already have the app installed. I keep seeing Amazon Kindle ads on both my iPad and my iPhone that already have the application installed. As a developer, I know there’s a way to prevent those ads from showing by detecting whether the app is installed at runtime. I think this strange behavior happens on both iAd and AdMob. If anyone from either organization is reading this, contact me ! As far as the future of ads in mobile apps goes, I hope Apple will continue working on increasing the fill rate, and that AdMob tries to increase relevancy and ad quality. Right now it’s really frustrating to see my “inventory” not live up to its revenue potential."

The scary part is mostly that WordPress seems to give you a hella lot of control. So you could seriously eff things up with a simple plugin.

        "content": "I just recently finished reading a book, so I better write up a review so I can collect my free Pizza Hut Personal Pan Pizza ! I read about Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value on Aaron Swartz’s 2010 Book Review (I’m trying to read as much as that dude does). Pricing has always been pretty interesting to me, so I figured a book about pricing would be a good, quick non-fiction read. Ironically, I opted to pay zero price for the book, borrowing it from the library instead of buying it. Previously, I read Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture , which also concerned pricing, but mostly in the super cheap range. Priceless takes more of a psychological stab at human behavior. There are a few experiments that both books alluded to, like the Hershey’s kiss experiment. Having read these two books (and the Freakonomics ones), I kind of think I should’ve been an economist. Priceless starts out a bit slow by giving you a crash course in human psychology. Homo Economicus is described as a human who makes only rational decisions, and only the most rational. As a model, HomoEco is probably only useful in lab situations. As the book describes, human behavior is not only often irrational, but also very easy to manipulate. Priming and Anchoring are ways to change a person’s opinion on something before they’ve even seen it. The book gives this example. Research subjects were asked which percentage of the UN is comprised of African nations. Before that question, they were asked to give an over/under on a percentage. The percentage given was either really low (10%) or somewhat average (60%). The difference in that first question, is the percentage of African nations in the UN above or below (10/60%) affected their guess of what it actually was. The scary thing is that this works with many things, including pricing. Another experiment involved real estate and a differing list prices. Subjects (both normal people and real estate agents) were given list prices of a home and were asked to give a reasonable bid. Even the real estate professionals were susceptible to the anchoring effect of the suggested prices, though to a lesser degree. After giving a solid scientific basis for human irrationality (specifically regarding pricing), the book goes through many short examples where the these effects were either exploited or tested in slightly different contexts. It’s all pretty interesting stuff, especially to someone who feels they are above Jedi price tricks like me though I am probably not). There are also a few methods described to try to ward against anchoring and priming. One is to immediately set up an argument. If someone says “do you think this book is worth 26.99?” and you say “yes,” then immediately think of reasons why it might be worth less than that. This is also why you should always take a friend with you to the car dealership to argue with. Overall I thought the book was really interesting. If you can get past all of the cognitive science at the beginning (I might’ve found it boring because I had heard about most of it before), the second half of the book is a really quick and interesting read."

Google seems to be taking a hybrid approach, which is pretty interesting. You get a notification the first time you arrive somewhere (probably only for places you’ve checked into before), and then an option to automatically check in after that. I might end up building some kind of hybrid (or a simple option in settings) system in Checkmate to see if that works better in general. I wonder how Google is mitigating the cost of GPS usage in its Latitude app. I always figured that the thing keeping auto-checkin out of official apps is the fact that they run the battery down pretty hard."

        "content": "I saw a Facebook Poll late last night that a friend had voted on. The question was something like “Which pair of shoes should I get?” The poll had twitpic.com links as answers, so the idea was that people look at the pics and let the guy decide which pair of shoes was better. Apparently in Facebook Polls, you click on the answer to vote. And there’s no unvote (you can vote for another choice, but you can’t abstain after clicking). So people ended up clicking on the twitpic link thinking they’d see the image, and ended up accidentally voting on the poll. I fell for this, too. There were something like a couple thousand answers on that poll. I believe it’s been removed now. I figured I could do better with a more salient question, so I made one up myself. “Which pair of glasses look better on me?” I made the question have two twitpic links, which you can view here and here if you actually copy and paste them in. I figured people are naturally judgers, and something like helping someone choose glasses to wear is an easy task (plus you theoretically get to see pictures of faces, which people just love, consciously or subconsciously). I started the poll late last night, which probably didn’t help, but a few friends took the bait. I hope they forgive me as I did this for science the lulz! When I woke up this morning, there were currently 51 votes, from people I know, friends of friends, and even people two degrees out of my social network! I think it would be really interesting to see how this poll spreads through Facebook (assuming they don’t shut it down first). I guess now that this post is published, any scientific value is gone (since you could be reading from anywhere and vote for my poll non-virally). The main point is that when you design systems very rigidly (in Facebook’s case, not letting people abstain from a poll, which believe it or not is a valid bit of information), interesting consequences pop up. I’ll keep checking the status of the poll and see if it actually blows up, whimpers and dies or gets taken down quickly. Analysis Edit: I think another reason that this poll is so effective is that it makes it seem that the person who voted is the originator of the poll. Check out the newsfeed formatting: The voter’s name is prominently displayed (though I blurred it) and the person who asked the question is nowhere to be seen. Edit #1 : The time is now about 12:40PM and the total number of voters has doubled to 99! Edit #2 : It’s about 1:10PM and the number has doubled again to 201!

If you already know you’d like to read the content on Instapaper, it’s a pain to manually add each thing you want to read. With Instascriber, you can just set the feed you’d like to subscribe to. Instascriber will periodically check the feed for new items and add it to your Instapaper reading list automatically in the background. That’s it. Boom! For now, I’m considering the web app to be in beta. So let me know if you find bugs or anything."

        "content": "I recently flew into the Detroit airport McNamara Terminal, and I made an observation that most of my fellow travelers probably made as well. That particular terminal consists of two long sides that branch out of the middle of the terminal. Our flight taxied to just about the farthest you can possibly be from the exit of the airport. Everyone had to walk across the furthest path (or take the tram) to get to the baggage claim and the airport exit. Why? I read somewhere that airports used to get a lot of complaints about the baggage claim taking too long to get started. Travelers would have to wait at the carousel thing and probably got really bored. To fix that, the airports would drop people off at further gates, making them walk further. This longer walk caused the “wait time” at the baggage claim to be shorter, and they got less complaints. Perhaps that’s what happened to me and my fellow travelers. I would argue that the particular “fix” I described probably shouldn’t be used anymore. Since most airlines charge people to check in bags, I think many don’t even need to wait at the baggage claim anymore (myself included). The fix is an interesting psychological trick, but it doesn’t actually buy anyone time, and it just makes me take longer to get out of the airport. I’d argue that this is interaction design gone bad, but I don’t have a way to confirm that this strategy is the reason we were dropped off so far from the exit. The flight was getting in at 10:30 and we passed numerous free gates, so I can’t think of any other good reason (maybe to save the plane some fuel?)."

        "url": "/blog/2011/01/06/impressions-of-android-from-an-iphone-userdeveloper/",
        "content": "I just got an Android phone, the HTC Hero, to play around with and perhaps develop on. It was only $55 on Ebay (including shipping) which seemed like a steal to me. I’m currently using it on WiFi without any phone service (the phone has a bad ESN, so that’s probably why the price was so low). My first impression as an iPhone user is that the interface is really clunky. There just isn’t as much attention paid to detail. For example, there are often measurable delays between pressing a button and seeing something happen. This happens when I try to add a widget to the home screen or open an app that hasn’t been opened into memory. If I press a button and I don’t see something happen immediately , I will assume I missed the button and press it again. This is extremely frustrating since the iPhone animates immediately upon user interaction. The iPhone may not be any faster than my Android phone, but it at least gives the illusion of it (which is probably just as good in terms of usability). Another thing I noticed is the lack of “back” buttons in the Android apps. Even Twitter lacks the onscreen back button. I assume this is following some kind of standard Android paradigm of favoring physical buttons over onscreen ones. It took me a while to get used to hitting the physical back button (and home, menu and search for that matter) instead of looking for navigation on the screen. While this is a different paradigm, I’m not sure I’m in a position to say it’s worse, better or on par with the iPhone. My suspicion is that the lack of onscreen navigation requires the user to go through more context switches (screen to physical button back to screen) which is disorienting. This is made worse by the fact that there’s seven fuckin’ buttons on my particular phone! I’m sure people adapt and get used to it, but I’m personally used to having just one button that takes me to the home screen (oh, and the volume and lock buttons, but they don’t serve dynamic functions in applications (unless they want to break the App Store terms)). About the only positive thing I can say about the Android platform is that Google is integrating the shit out of it with their own services. I only have to sign in once with my Google account and I get Voice, Talk, Maps, Search, Goggles, Places, Latitude, Market, Contacts, Gmail, YouTube and probably some other things I’m forgetting. The voice commands are incredibly cool, though I wonder how many times I’d actually use them instead of doing things the normal way. Oh, another positive is that Angry Birds is free on Android, though my device is way too slow to run it. I’m currently using a ROM with 2.2 on my HTC Hero, so that might account for some performance issues (though I thought it was supposed to be faster). I’m still kind of unimpressed by Android as a whole though, especially in terms of end to end usability. I originally got this device so I could test code on hardware, but I’m not so sure I even want to develop for Android anymore. I’ll probably end up writing some simple code, at least. Does anyone with a newer Android phone want to debunk or argue with anything I’ve written?"

        "content": "It’s January, which means it’s time for really misinformed predictions that will just look silly in hindsight! I’ve been reluctant in the past to use Google Voice because of integration issues, but I think 2011 is the year that I’ll start relying on it more, especially if I end up changing my real phone number (I’ll just give out my Google Voice # and forward calls). I recently bought an Android phone and was thinking of what I could use it for. With Google Voice and Skype, I could make “calls” and send text messages wherever I have an internet connection. If Google eventually enables making voice calls over wifi (like in Google Chat, and I predict they will some time this year), I think the big phone companies will start hurting, because people will want data-only plans so that they can call with Google. This “cable cutting” has already happened with landlines (my Mom has a dedicated phone device that does VoIP) and cable tv. So it makes sense that wireless phone providers will soon feel the effects as well. I’d really love to set up the HTC Hero that I ordered as a dedicated “landline” phone that I use with my internet connection at home. Of course, most people will still probably continue to use the standard bundled minutes + texts (+ data) phone plans, but I feel early adopters are just itching to pay one monthly data bill for all of their infrastructure needs. It’ll only be a matter of time before the mainstream begins to head in that direction. I think that the phone as we know it (how ridiculous is it to pay a phone plan based on the number of minutes in the plan?) will begin to die in 2011, with more emphasis on bandwidth as the infrastructure requirement."

        "content": "Looking back at 2010, this year has been one of change and growth for me. I’d like to take a post and look back at what I did this year. January and February were kinda uneventful. I was pretty nose down trying to become a good PM at Microsoft. Oh, and I was busy making troll posts about how the iPad was gonna suck and I wrote a lot of book and music reviews. In March , I attended SXSW and moderated a panel that I had submitted the year before on Student Startups. I met many of my friends who I hadn’t seen in a while and met a lot of cool new people . It was from that experience that I decided I needed to stop doing what I was currently doing and change course so that I could do what I was “meant” to do. Also in March, I was rejected from the one PhD program I had applied to. In hindsight, this was probably a good thing. I’m used to rejection anyway! In April I officially resigned from Microsoft as a PM after only about 7 months (and 5 managers!) on the job. I knew this was a serious decision. In hindsight, I’m glad I did it. Quitting let me focus on other cool stuff that I was meaning to get into, like iPhone (now iOS) development. In the same month I finally released an app to the iTunes App Store , something I had wanted to do for years. In May, I moved back to Ann Arbor to be near to my GF, which required me to pack all my crap into my Corolla and drive the whole way. I also flew to New Mexico for a wedding and got to hang out with my family. This probably explains why I have no blog posts for May 2010. In June I mostly basked in the glory of my funemployment and took it easy (read: I marathoned Lost). I also tinkered with my existing iPhone app and enhanced it a bit, building up my Obj-C chops. I interviewed for some jobs here and there to test out the waters, but none ended up being fruitful. The incompetence of HR departments never ceases to amaze me, but I suppose that’s a topic for a different post. In July I looked for some more opportunities to work with other companies. I didn’t end up teaming up with anyone, but a conversation I had during an “interview” led me to start development on Checkmate, my second app for the iPhone. I spent a fair amount of July developing and testing Checkmate. I also took a cool part-time gig with the coolest boss in history . August saw the release of Checkmate , which was featured in a story on Mashable ! Thanks, Pete Cashmore! While Checkmate wasn’t (and it still isn’t) the perfect app, I learned a ton from developing it and gained a lot of confidence as well. I also discovered the NPR news story of that time I went on a chocolate factory tour in Seattle ! My September was mostly spent improving Checkmate and learning about how to handle a paid app in the App Store. Doing a paid app is a quite a bit different than a free one. I also spent some time looking for an old printing press and finally scored one on craigslist ! In October , I started working on another app that eventually became ♥s Threadless. This was the biggest undertaking I’ve done so far on iOS, and it also required me to do more complicated work in App Engine than I had done before. I also spent October tracking down supplies for my Letterpress machine, and ended up doing my first prints ever: Giraffe Coasters ! I split my November into days where I’d work on getting better at printmaking (and coming up with stuff like these letterpress business cards ) and days where I’d work on the Threadless app. I finally ended up releasing the Threadless app at the end of November. The reception of the app has been great! So far the app has 6 perfect reviews and one 4-star review. That makes me incredibly happy. This brings us to the current month, December . I started another app engine project that’s not quite ready for public beta yet (though I feel it will be really soon). Because of the app, Threadless was super cool and invited me to their Chicago headquarters. I finally realized one of my lifelong dreams of becoming a Threadless t-shirt model ! I’ve also been hanging out in Albuquerque and spoiling my nephew rotten for a few weeks. And that is my 2010 year in review. One surprising thing is that many times during 2010, I was really down on myself. But looking back, I actually accomplished some neat stuff! I think it boils down to the fact that there’s still a lot of uncertainty in my life, and that’s hard to manage. But I think I’m getting better at managing it every day. In retrospect, 2010 was a great year, maybe even the best (so far). Looking at 2011, I see a lot of opportunity. I’m going to continue to remind myself that minor setbacks are just that. I’ll push through them and accomplish even more than I did in 2010! My role model for 2011 is this guy: Hopefully I’ll have some good stuff to report in a year or so!"

I won’t talk about what discussions went on (I’m being held by a “ frieNd-DA “), but I can say that the Threadless office is mega sweet! I got to hang out with some of the developers on Threadless and talked about the site and other random stuff (like t-shirt quality through the ages). I pointed out something that actually ended up being a bug that one of the dudes fixed almost immediately! Talk about transparency. At some point we were talking about how the Threadless t-shirt models are picked. Ivan (super nice guy) mentioned that the photographer might be looking for someone to model a shirt. He ended up replying and I got to model a brand new Threadless shirt in the cold, cold December Chicago air. The shirt’s called …To The Birds . Buy it today! The Threadless office itself is pretty nice. They moved in relatively recently so it still looks a little bare. Apparently they have big plans for decorating. I was, once again, super star struck by seeing people who I feel I know very well through their pictures on the Threadless site. I met the beard guy, Red the dog (I think it’s a Shiba Inu) and other assorted celebrities. One of the developers I met was the guy in the Mr Tee photo and another was Mario in another shirt (I couldn’t figure out which one). Oh, and I said hi to Colleen and Kristen, who I first met at SXSW ! They let me go down to the warehouse and pick out some shirts to take home. It kind of took all the willpower in my being not to clean them out (they probably would not have let me). I got Upso , Mister Mittens and Houndstooth . I also got a cool I ♥ Threadless shirt that they don’t really sell anymore. Limited edition! This is probably already obvious, but Threadless is an awesome place with some awesome people making awesome things (mostly shirts). I had a blast meeting the people behind it and I hope I can come back again really soon!"

Apparently the feed parser I’m using is pretty inefficient because it’s eating up a lot of resources (relatively speaking) on App Engine. I remembered that the http protocol is pretty smart, and there’s a way to figure out if stuff has changed since the last time you grabbed it. Google’s urlfetch doesn’t seem to support conditional GETs (someone tell me if I am wrong). I looked around and found a few tutorials on how to accomplish this in Python using urllib2. The tutorials weren’t exactly what I wanted, so I had to change a few things here or there. Here’s a snippet of code that I’m using: import urllib2 feed = Feed.get() #my feed object has a etag, last_modified and url property req = urllib2.Request(url) if feed.etag: req.add_header(\"If-None-Match\", feed.etag) if feed.last_modified: req.add_header(\"If-Modified-Since\", feed.last_modified) try: url_handle = urllib2.urlopen(req) content = url_handle.read() headers = url_handle.info() feed.etag = headers.getheader(\"ETag\") feed.last_modified = headers.getheader(\"Last-Modified\") feed.put() except Exception, e: logging.info(e) #just says 304 didn't change return dostuffwith(content) This handles my use case, which is doing work if the feed is new, and ignoring it if it hasn’t been modified. I could probably wrap this into a function that returned false if it the file hadn’t changed, and the content if it was new… Probably will do that next."

Hurry up and download and review it, then come back here for more info about the app. It’s no secret that I’ve been a huge fan of Threadless since I discovered it back in 2005 ( see these blog posts for proof ). I really love the fact that the community provides designs and decides which ones will be printed. The company is really only there to provide the machinery to make shirts and fulfill orders! I wanted to contribute to the community by making an unofficial Threadless app (and maybe get a little store credit to feed my t-shirt needs). My main reasoning for writing a native Threadless app is that I found it pretty hard to browse shirts, even in a fully fledged web browser let alone an iPhone browser. The Threadless site is by no means bad, but it’s hard to see what designs look like when the images are small and on models. I prefer viewing the actual design. So I built an app that makes it easy to 1) browse and find cool shirts and 2) share them with your friends. In order to do this, I needed to get a database of shirts on Threadless. It’s kind of unfortunate that Threadless doesn’t have an API. At all. Threadless does, however, has a few feeds of shirts: one for shirts that are in stock and another for the weekly additions. I parsed this list of shirts and saved them in an App Engine database along with some other metadata like image urls, category info, etc. I also figured out a way to get the list of all Threadless shirts, including the ones that aren’t currently in stock. What this means is that the â™¥s Threadless app will help you find more shirts than even the official website can. You can filter by category, color and run fulltext searches on the entire shirt database. As far as the front end work went, I had to build a custom table view cell to scroll through shirts and a nested scrollview to view shirt images. The shirt view looks a lot like the native photo browser app for the iPhone. I also added features for sharing, including saving the image to your photo album, posting the design on Twitter and Facebook and emailing the shirt design as an attachment. I figure that covers most bases as far as sharing goes. So far I’ve only designed and built the iPhone version. I think an iPad version would be neat, too, but I want to gauge the interest in the iPhone/iPod app before putting more time into this. If you like the app, let me know and write up a review for it !"

Many (but not all) Twitter clients have url schemes that allow you to open them with a particular message filled out, etc. There’s a few here , but it’s not a definitive list by any means.

Since I wanted to have a vertical card, I only had so much space for the info. The type that I have doesn’t have the ‘@’ symbol, and “Hung AT Hung-Truong.com” wouldn’t fit on one line. So I just ended up putting it on two lines, which is nice because then the other line is just my website address. I like the grainy look of the block ‘H’. Each one looks a little different, and at one point I mixed in some more blue to make it a darker green. It’s nice that the card itself is a slightly unique print. If I could redo this card, I’d probably try to pick a smaller font for the info. And I’d also choose different sizes for my name versus the other stuff. I’m sort of limited in the type that I currently own (4 trays). If I end up making more cards, I might just buy a base so that I can make my own photopolymer plates.

It looks like you’ll be able to order prints from a number of templates, some of which can also include photos: I think it’s neat that letterpress is becoming mainstream (again) enough that it warrants a feature in iLife. As far as my concerns about taking away business (which I haven’t quite decided to get into), I think it’s good that Apple’s pushing this kind of typing further into the mainstream. There’ll probably be a lot more people interested in letterpress, and not just for the personalized photo cards, etc. On a technical note, I’m interested how Apple is going to farm out the print jobs. Do they have their own print shop with all the Heidelberg machines, or are they partnering with a shop? Depending on the volume of orders, I wonder what their turnaround time would be."

        "content": "Ever since I signed up for Facebook, I’ve wanted a clean and easy way to export the content that my friends and I create on it. See this post for background. Facebook has never really made it easy to do so for end users, though they have an API that could theoretically be used for data export. Just recently, they announced a new feature that allows you to download your information . I gave the feature a test drive and took a look at what you actually get. The process for grabbing your information is pretty simple. You go to Account Settings -&gt; Download Your Information and then request your data. Facebook sends you an email when the zip file containing your stuff is ready. The zip file contains a few files and directories: html, photos and videos. Photos contains the photos you’ve uploaded, videos contains the videos, and html contains things like a list of your friends, messages, notes, wall posts and events. These are all stored in html files, which makes it easy for normal users to view them. From a data portability standpoint, it’s great that you can get all of your photos, videos and messages, etc. I like the fact that they’re in html that’s easy for anyone to browse. Since it works in its own self-contained directory structure, you could theoretically upload the contents to your own web server and host your albums yourself! For most users, the data download feature is really great. From a programmer/hardcore archivist’s point of view, the data download is still lacking. For example, the friend’s list gives you a list of your friends’ names. It does not, however, provide you with the unique identifier for your friends (e.g. their Facebook profile name or id number). This might be useful if you have a friend named “John Smith” and you’d like to know exactly which John it is. Generally, the files just don’t contain enough metadata to keep good records. Let’s say that in the distant future, Facebook has been abandoned. What we have left are the .zip files that people used to download their information. How would we go about reconstructing network ties? With the files as they are today, we can only make assumptions using names, which aren’t unique identifiers. While some people would say that including those would be overkill, they could be pretty easily added via meta tags within the html (or in a separate xml file for hardcore nerds like me). In addition to this lack of metadata, my other complaint is that Facebook only gives you half of your information. You can download a pretty ego-centric payload of data; stuff that friends wrote on your wall and photos you uploaded. You cannot, however, download things that you posted on your friends’ walls. This is especially important because Facebook’s early messaging model was based on wall-to-wall posts. My oldest wall posts come without any sort of context at all. Finally, it seems that Facebook did the unthinkable in deleting user data until around early 2006. I signed up for Facebook in January of 2005, yet my first wall post that shows up in my downloaded info is from February 2006. So there’s a whole year’s worth of wall messages that are missing. I suppose there’s no way for Facebook to retrieve this info anymore (unless they’re just witholding it because it’s hard to get to). If you found this tl;dr, here’s a summary: The Good: Facebook information download makes it easy for anyone to download their data in a nicely organized and self-contained package. Everyone should go to their account settings right now and download their data, even if they don’t plan on using for anything in the near future. The download provides a lot of information and is a good faith attempt at letting users “own” their data. There’s still work to be done, howerver. The Bad: The data that’s downloaded lacks enough meaningful metadata. Specifically, the data regarding connections between you and your friends is too general. Unique identifiers for friend connections would be a good first step. Facebook also omits an important side of your data: the stuff you’ve posted to others’ walls. Finally, Facebook’s data download only goes back to early 2006 (for me). What Facebook Should Do Next: I think Facebook’s done a really great job so far for this first iteration of data download. Now they should add more metadata and provide data in a cleaner xml or json format. After that, they should enable download of photos and video in their original format (I have a feeling Facebook keeps the original size photos before they resize them). I think that providing users with an easy way to download all of their data will lead to a better relationship and more trust, which is something Facebook could really use."

I had ordered all the other supplies I needed, including: A crapload of blank coasters (1000) A giraffe printer’s block I already had the ink from my purchase of the machine. The machine itself is from 1941, and the ink was from the same company, in a tube. I’m not sure the ink is from 1941, but if it is, it’s held up really well! I also bought a bunch of other stuff that ended up helping me a lot when troubleshooting. Luckily, I read a lot of posts on briar press and was eventually able to get a decent looking impression on my coasters. At first, the ink was getting onto the block, like behind the giraffe’s neck. This meant that the ink rollers were pushing up too hard against the printing surface. I had to adjust the pressure by putting some electrician’s tape on the chase bed. Three layers of tape made the rollers touch the printing surface just right, while not getting on other stuff. The impression itself was also a little too deep at first. You could see the part of the block that pressed into the coaster (which at this point didn’t have ink). So I adjusted the pressure of the platen (the part that runs into the printing surface) with a screwdriver. After getting a few crazy impressions, I started getting the hang of the adjustments. I got quite a few good looking coasters. Here’s a video of the machine in action: I’ll be experimenting with letterpress stuff some more once I get different colored inks and more printing blocks. I’d also like to get a printing base so I can make my own photopolymer plates (printed from normal Illustrator files). Those cost quite a bit though, so I’d like to see what my press can do before blowing a lot of cash on it. I also put the coasters I made on sale at Etsy, so take a look at my giraffe letterpress coasters and buy ‘em before someone else does!"

I wanted a tabletop press that wasn’t too heavy. I ended up getting a Kelsey Excelsior 5×8 model from a guy just outside of Lansing. Emily and I drove over there to pick it up, then we took it to her parent’s place in Grand Rapids where Randy did a super good job fixing it up with WD-40 and oil. He also attached it to a piece of wood for easy letterpress action! Thanks, Randy! We learned from the seller that this particular press was rescued from a funeral home, where it was used to print memorials and stuff. We also found some pre-set type along with the press with words like “DIED” and “INTERNMENT.” Creepy! I hope no ghosts decide to haunt my press. Because of its history, I named the press Mortimer. It also sounds like a good old-timey name. The serial number on the press’ chase bed reads “B41D” which tells me that the thing was built in April 1941. Although I need to buy new rollers for the press, I decided to practice setting type. I made a pseudo business card and made a blind impression with the type. I made the imprint on some of my old Microsoft business cards (won’t need those ones anymore). I can’t wait to see what the results look like with ink and paper that’s made for letterpress. I also have a few other supplies I need to buy before I’m in business. Stay tuned for updates on letterpress stuff!"

Something I noticed right away which disappointed me was that they basically slapped on a new view to the existing app, and didn’t even bother to match the style of the original app! Screenshot from official foursquare blog Not only is the new bar a different color, it’s also a different height than the existing one! It also lacks labels where the original one has labels below the icons. This is simply sloppy design. These two screens exist in the same version of their app! It wouldn’t have taken much more work to either update the app so both bars are grey, or match the new views to the old one. I recently saw that foursquare is looking for a new Product Manager . I’m considering applying to help them out with their product issues 🙂 EDIT: After emailing back and forth with Alex Rainert, foursquare’s head of product, it seems that, to answer my own question, this was a conscious design decision to change the visual style of the buttons. In one context, they are for navigating various top level features, and in another, they are buttons for various pop-up actions. It’s of my opinion that the change in visual style is a bit too much (the change in height along with the loss of the location footer in some screens), but that’s a design choice that foursquare made intentionally."

        "content": "I’ve got some more thoughts on iAd after trying iAd out on one of my apps for about a month now. As I noted in an earlier post , Apple responded to a really low fill rate on their iAd program by enabling developer ads. Developer ads are simple banner ads that entice a user to download an iPhone app. Here’s what the use case looks like via Business Insider : To Apple’s credit, the workflow is actually pretty good. It doesn’t require users to leave the app to download another one. Since developers can’t really afford the insane $2 cost per click that the big media customers pay, Apple is charging $.25 a click instead, and no cost per impression. Theoretically, this should mean that the fill rate would be very high (as long as developers are not maxing out on their daily spend limit or too aggressively filtering out apps). Yet I’ve noticed a pretty big fall in fill rate (from about 30% to 20%) in the last month. I think the main issue is that Apple never really intended iAd to be used for performance advertising. Performance advertising is about getting that direct action (in this case, an app download). Apple’s been pushing iAd as a great Brand advertising solution (where the user is not expected to go out and buy Dove soap from their phone). That’s why the premium brands are willing to pay so much per click and impression. By comparison, AdMob ads on the iPhone seem to be more geared toward performance advertising. By introducing developer ads, I think Apple has tried to appease publishers at the cost of the perceived premium value of iAds. Sure, the developer ads aren’t as flashy as the premium advertisers’, but $.25 versus $2 a click for the same piece of real estate is quite a difference. Add the perception that iAds for developers are not cost-effective and you could come to the conclusion that Apple is doing it wrong. It doesn’t help that the premium brand advertisers seem to be frustrated with the process of dealing with Apple as a gatekeeper . So what can Apple do to fix this? They should go back to their specialization: doing one or a few things really well. They should focus on iAd as a brand advertising platform. They should work on getting as many large partners onto iAd as quickly as possible. This will alleviate the growing pains that publishers (including me) are feeling with fill rates. Right now it seems like Apple is reacting rather than acting; following rather than leading. They need to show that they’re serious about carving their own niche in the mobile advertising space."

        "content": "I finally heard about Quora enough times (I suppose I reached my contagion threshold) to make a profile for it a week or so ago, and I ended up exploring it in depth today. Quora is basically a site that lets you ask questions and answer other people’s questions. Facebook also just recently released a feature called Questions that seems sort of similar. While Quora hasn’t put limits on what kinds of questions you can ask, the bulk seem to be about technology and startups, probably because of the types of early adopters who are using the site. Quora is interesting to me because it’s basically enabling people to share knowledge. In a way, it’s like Wikipedia, but with a seemingly smaller barrier to entry. While Wikipedia has some harsh rules on how to edit an article, Quora is centered around questions and answers on various topics. You can literally sign up and answer questions within a few minutes. As with any great piece of social software, Quora seems to work because it makes the right things visible, which gives incentives for people to keep contributing. Personally, I see it as a way to build up my online reputation as an expert on a number of subjects. It’s interesting because the incentives to use the site are baked into the site itself. It’s easy to see who has answered many questions, who has a lot of followers, who has been “endorsed” by others, etc. With this system, pretty much everyone wins. The question askers have their questions answered, the answerers get the glory of answering a question well, and even users who do neither can still benefit from reading good answers to good questions. Another neat aspect of the site is that there are many users who could be considered “internet celebrities” or important in some other right. There are many founders of companies and other execs who go to the trouble of answering questions about the companies they founded. This is cool because users are all sort of on the same level (or at least have the potential to be). Think of the opportunities if you were one of the first 1000 people on Twitter and could have great conversations with the other early adopters. From playing around with it a bit today, I’m very impressed and excited about Quora. By comparison, I just goofed off on Facebook Questions and unlocked the Rickroll Easter Egg (ask “How is babby formed?”). Quora still has a few things it could do better (like make it easier to find really great answers to really great questions, perhaps older ones) but even now it seems like a great tool. With the right attention to detail and community, I feel like it could be the next Wikipedia in terms of social computing success stories. Oh, and here’s an example of a really good answer to a question: Why is Facebook creating a Q&amp;A product to compete against Quora?"

        "url": "/blog/2010/09/09/what-i-learned-from-checkmate/",
        "content": "Just about two weeks ago, I released my first paid iPhone app , Checkmate . The experience has been priceless, plus I made a few bucks as well. I thought I’d share the stuff I learned, both technical and otherwise. Technical: Core Location. Being the first iPhone app I’ve done that uses Core Location, I learned a lot about the process of starting up the location manager, filtering location updates and getting them to work in the background. The background stuff is pretty new, just released in iOS 4. Design takes thought. One of the most difficult things in designing an app is balancing between user expectations (“it should work like magic”) and real-world constraints (battery, accuracy tradeoffs). I’ve taken the approach of leaving the details under the hood (another app that does something similar gives users full control) for simplicity. This is a deliberate design decision. I’ve found that many users are happy with the app, and some are unhappy. I assume there is a minority that is unhappy, but that they seem to be more vocal (more on that later). Core Data. I also learned about Core Data, since I use that for storing venue data persistently. There’s a bit of a learning curve with Core Data, but I have a pretty good idea of how it works. I guess it helps that I’ve designed a bunch of database schema in the past. Get to good enough. I definitely feel like I have accomplished something by releasing the app. I have wrestled in the past between releasing something when it’s “good enough” but not getting stuck in perfectionist limbo. In the case of Checkmate, I got to a point where I was happy enough with its performance (it works) and did not want to delay any further, lest I lose steam and give up on ever releasing it. Now that I’ve gotten a feedback loop going, it’ll be easier to improve and update the app anyway. As far as interface design goes, the app is a bit clunky for my taste. Having admitted that, I think I could go back and make some things more obvious (like the login screen) and polish up the user experience. Business-ey Ask for reviews. Ask satisfied customers for reviews. Because if you don’t, only the unhappy users will post them. And you’ll end up getting a pretty bad average rating. Even if your app makes crap into gold, there will be users who don’t see the value in it, or think that $2 is too much to pay. Encourage users to post reviews in-app and you’ll see a well-rounded view of what people think about your app. It’s okay to have a competitor. While developing my app, I found that another similar app had launched and gotten some press from Techcrunch. This was a bit depressing as I wanted to have that exposure. I ended up using it as a motivator since the blog post and app validated my own idea. There’s always room for competition, especially if you can outdo them. Popular takes all on the App Store. There have been blog posts on the subject of iTunes ranking and how valuable it is to make a top 100 list. Apps seem to be ranked in search based on their sales volume, which means that popular apps will become more popular. Having been featured on Mashable at launch, my app got to #2 for a “foursquare” search. This helped a lot for residual sales. I’m assuming that most apps are sold directly from app store searches. There are other ways to discover apps. Have fun! It was really exhilarating to see my app get into the app store and into the hands of users. I set up a twitter account to communicate with users, monitored twitter searches for my app and answered emails sent through a contact form on my website. It was really fun having people react to work that I did. It’s probably one of the strongest motivators for me to keep doing what I’m doing. I have learned a great deal from my first commercial app launch. I’m really glad that I had an idea and stuck with it to completion. I’m still learning a great deal from Checkmate. I know that this experience will make the launch of my next product/app (whatever it might be) more smooth, both for me and users!"

        "content": "I recently read an essay by Paul Graham on what happened to Yahoo . In it, he describes how Yahoo acted like a media company when it was really technology company, and how funky management made it into what it is today. One quote struck me as relevant today: By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme. Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo’s revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in. When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of “Eureka!” I was shouting “Sell!” Having just integrated iAd into one of my iPhone apps I’ve noticed that pretty much all of the ads are for other apps. Most of these apps are “free,” and I assume that they could potentially be using iAd for revenue as well. This is a result of low fill rates for iAd and Apple wanting to offer developers a way to advertise their apps. It makes sense, but one has to wonder exactly where all the money is eventually going (Apple gets a 40% cut of iAd revenue), and who has the incentive to keep that system running. A while ago I wrote my predictions for iAd . I didn’t foresee Apple opening iAds up to developers who wanted to advertise their apps. That’ll help the fill rate, but I can’t see it helping CPMs when developers have something like a $0.25 CPC and it was reported that the larger media campaigns like Dove were closer to $2 CPC. Seems like another race to the bottom, just like paid app prices."

        "content": "A few months ago, when I was living in Seattle, I went with my .gf and friend to a tour of Theo Chocolate . It’s a chocolate factory about two blocks from where I used to live that does organic chocolate. On the day of our visit, a news reporter was doing a radio spot for NPR on the factory. She asked to follow us around and we told her that was cool. I looked for the spot for a while online, but I couldn’t find it. Just now, I was looking at searches on how people get to my website, and I found one misspelled query for “Hung Troung” that I followed and led to this blog post . It’s the news report that I appeared in so long ago! I guess the lady didn’t have a lot to talk about because she used a lot of my random quotes. One of the funniest things that happened on the tour was this little kid (maybe 8 years old?) who kept on spewing non-sequiturs like “My uncle has a tree” and “I like pie” when asking questions. He reminded us of the I Like Turtles kid . I wish the reporter had gotten him in the story. I also remember the tour guide being a little over the top. Like in terms of being dramatic and stuff. I remember hearing someone say that she just got back from doing some audition, so maybe that was why. When the factory found out that the reporter had been following us around the whole tour, they felt sorry for us and got us some boxed confectionary candies. That was really nice. I think they were like $20 each or something and we got one each. Score! Thanks, Theo! Oh, and I think it’s kind of apparent that I mumble a lot, or maybe I was just nervous. I should work on that. Here’s the audio of the story and the transcription (Fair use?): [audio: HungTruongRadioTheo.mp3] Remember Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? Where four lucky kids win a tour of Willy Wonkaâ€™s secretive candy plant? Well, Theo Chocolate isnâ€™t that exclusiveâ€”but you better call ahead. Just one measure of its success; itâ€™s tours are booked solid. Hung Truong: â€œMake sure you call ahead because the tourâ€™s so popular. I think I reserved like four weeks or something in advance? Thatâ€™s really early.â€ Hung Truong came to Theo Chocolate to see where the candy he buys is born. Hung Truong: â€œOh wow the fig one is good.â€ Kate Kraay, leads this tour of about 20 visitors. Buzzing about each step of the chocolate barâ€™s creation. Kate Kraay: It’s this process of slurping up the chocolate from the bottom, spraying it up and around the sides; this is the closest thing that we have to Willy Wonkaâ€™s waterfall of chocolate. How did a company just four years old navigate through the recession? Vice President of Sales and Marketing Deb Music says one factor is the price. Theo bars run about $3 a piece. That’s proven to be not too high and not too low. Another ingredient to success is that Theo bills itself as the first organic, fair trade chocolate factory in the US. That plays especially well in the northwest. Music says founder Joe Whinney’s decision to relocate to Seattle from the east coast has been a golden ticket. Deb Music: â€œI think our values at this point are very progressive and in line with a lot of people’s values here and I think the company is inspiring because we’re really trying to effect positive change in the world.â€ Music says overall the company grew by 21 percent last year, despite the rough economy. And for the first part of this year Music says Theo has seen significant growth â€“ around 25 percent â€“ over 2009. Curtis Vreeland is a confection industry analyst from Pennsylvania. He says while the chocolate industry isn’t recession proof, it is recession resistant. Curtis Vreeland: â€œThe overall premium chocolate market is struggling, but they’re layers in there which are doing well. And those would be where Theo is and those companies that are sort of in the gourmet section, but not the high-end.â€ Another sweet spot for Theo is its identity. Curtis Vreeland: Once you’ve bought into the ethics of those kind of bars â€“ organic and fair trade â€“ you’re not going to shed your ethos in a recession. You may buy less. I think when the country comes out of the recession they’ll be buying quite a bit more. Back at the tour at Theo Chocolate, Hung Truong says it’s worth the price. Hung Truong: There’s like a psychology thing there, where you might not be able to afford the best things all the time, but you can afford something that’s really nice some times. And it’s just like what $3 for a bar? You’re treating yourself, and you’re not breaking the bank. By the end of the tour Truong is left with only one worry. Hung Truong: I think those little kids disappeared. It’s oddly like Charlie and the chocolate factory. Did one turn into a blueberry? What happened to them? I’m Chantal Anderson reporting."

They’ve since moved on to greener pastures and have found their true calling, or are at least a step closer. They are part of a larger movement who believe in an iterative career path. Disillusioned employees: share your pain and ask the panel how and why they made their decision to quit. Learn the warning signs of a bad fit during the interview process and in the first few days on the job. Know that you aren’t alone, and there’s something you can do about it. Employers: learn how to decrease new employee turnaround. Discover the best incentives to retain great talent. Learn when and when not to hire. When the going gets tough, quit! Questions Answered: What are the warning signs before I accept a job that it is not a good fit? What alternatives are there for reconciliation before sending in my resignation? What should I do before quitting (e.g. securing a new job, etc)? How do I explain my short stay to a potential new employer? What should I learn from my bad experience, and how should I apply it to the next job? &lt;/blockquote&gt; As many of you know, I quit my job at Microsoft after about 6 months. There were a lot of reasons why, and it boils down to the fact that it just wasn’t a good fit. I’ve noticed a disproportionate number of my cohort from grad school who also left their first jobs after graduating within one year. I thought it would be interesting to do a panel on the subject and try to get to the bottom of this phenomenon. I think It’s of interest not only to people who aren’t happy at their jobs, but also employers who struggle with retention rates, especially among younger employees. I think it’ll be an interesting panel. While I moderated a SXSW panel at this year’s conference , I was thinking that I could either moderate again (it’s very fun and stressful) or be a panelist, since I’ve experienced it myself. I’d really appreciate it if you could take the time to vote for my proposal, leave a comment, and spread the word ! As with my last panel, I think the subject is something that people think about, but often do not talk about. If we can get a room of like-minded people together, I’m confident that people can be inspired to make tough decisions and get more out of life!"

        "content": "My Anime Nano iPhone app was just approved again for the app store. “Approved again?” you ask? Yes. Here’s the story. I had a mobile startup a while back called Troubadour Mobile. While the company hasn’t been operating for a while, I was using its iPhone developer account to mess around with submitting stuff to the app store. I wrote my Anime Nano app and it was pretty cool. I wanted to start getting into other kinds of apps, and I wanted to integrate iAd with Anime Nano. To do this, I needed to make my own iPhone dev account because I didn’t want to set up the taxes for a defunct company. I figured it would be a simple process to move an app from one owner to another, because it must happen all the time, right? I sent in a request to move Anime Nano from Troubadour’s account to my own personal dev account. That was around the beginning of July. I didn’t get a reply until the beginning of August, more than a month later. Unfortunately, between the time I requested the move, my company’s account expired (I wasn’t going to keep paying $100 a year for an account we wouldn’t use). When the account expired, my original app was taken off of the iTunes App Store. After that happened I just submitted the application again under my own account with a slightly different name (Anime Nano!). Apparently, the “application transfer” doesn’t really even transfer anything. Apple just asked me to remove one of my apps from sale and re-upload the binary. So I waited a month for nothing. This was pretty annoying, because if I had known earlier, I would’ve just done so myself. I don’t know why I needed to wait a month to get those instructions. Anyway, I submitted the app about a week ago and it was finally approved this afternoon. I’m happy to say that the iAds work and they look pretty neat. Anyway, if you haven’t gotten it yet (and actually, if you downloaded it before), go get Anime Nano! If you have the old version, iTunes won’t know when it’s updated unless you get the new version."

This was the third time I’ve seen her in concert, which is the most times I’ve seen anyone in concert, I think. Besides the band I was in myself, which doesn’t count. I had recently seen her and the band in Seattle in October last year . I was hoping there’d be a lot of new material, but for the most part it was a lot of songs from her latest two albums, Everybody and Be Okay / Girls and Boys . She played one new song called “Parachute” that was catchy. As usual, Ingrid and the band came off as genuinely having a good time. I think it helped that this was a fan show (they pre-sold out to the fan email list) and they had been opening for a band so no one knew who they were for the past few shows. As with any live show, the best parts are when the band does something unexpected. In this show, they mixed in the chorus from Poker Face into Soldier (I think they might’ve done that last time, too), did a cover of Britney Spears’ Toxic as a last song (before they left for an encore) and also played a punky fast version of The Way I Am as their real last song (which they also played at normal speed earlier in the show). Overall, It was a really fun show. Ingrid and the band really have a good time, and it rubs off on the fans, especially in a small venue like The Ark. Hopefully a new album is on the way. I’d like to hear more new material next time."

The others are all either cheat/walkthrough guides, or random knockoffs. The insane thing is that the price of the actual game is $1, and so are the knockoffs! You can buy the game for the same amount as an unauthorized guide, which has information freely that’s available online! The craziest one is the app called “The Angry Bird,” which has an angry looking bird trying to kill worms or something. I am assuming all of these apps are legal under fair use and whatnot (if they’re only stating facts), yet something tells me they could be violating trademark rules… I wonder if other popular apps have this same kind of thing happening to them. And I wonder if the developers of Angry Birds are bothered by it. If they got angry enough, they might be able to make a spinoff game called “Angry Developers of Angry Birds.”"

        "content": "After reading this article on the upcoming iAd release , I have a few thoughts on the future of Apple’s mobile advertising platform. iAds on Apple devices will be rich media experiences, they’ll stay in the app, and they’ll make developers tons of money. That’s what Apple assumes, at least. The major takeaways from this article are that only a limited number of advertisers are signing on at first, and at a really high premium. What’s more, iAds are costly to “develop” which will limit the number of advertisers at first. Advertising relies on a steady supply of supply (advertising inventory) and demand (ad impressions). The advertisers supply the… well, supply, and the developers handle the demand by providing users who will see the ads. Because there’s not much supply yet, and because I have a feeling many developers will integrate iAds into their apps or already have, I predict a few things happening: Users will go through a high degree of ad fatigue. With only a few different ads available, users will probably get bored of the same ads over and over. Sure, they’re rich and interactive, but if I see that same Toy Story 3 ad a billion times, it won’t be effective anymore. This will probably contribute to iAd blindness. Initial advertisers will pay a premium for being first. Because of the limited inventory and abundant number of impressions, advertisers will probably end up using up a lot of their inventory. Apple might have a way of throttling ad impressions so they remain constant throughout a time period (or at least they should). If so, iAd display will be pretty erratic. Sometimes they’ll show and sometimes they won’t. Of course, if that happens, publishers will be upset that their placements aren’t selling. Publishers (developers) will make some money, but not as much as they thought (at first). Or at least, not until the ad inventory goes up. Because Apple will probably throttle the advertisements going to them, or users will be weary of the same ads showing up, publishers will suffer at first. In the long run, publishers will probably end up making more when the supply and demand issues fix themselves. Advertisements will probably start off being innovative, then fall in quality. I have a feeling they will mirror the app store apps. There will be many high quality ads at first, but once Apple requires a steady amount of rich ads, others will develop iAds for advertisers. The ad inventory quality will suffer because of the cost and time associated with creating high quality ads. On a high level, I see a few early issues in the iAd platform, mostly the demand for ads outweighing the amount of initial advertisements. Over time, this will correct itself, but at the cost of the quality of ads delivered. Think of how the App Store degenerated into crappy mirror apps, etc. Apple would like to keep the quality of their ads high, but I can’t see this happening based on the number of ads they need to deliver. This will happen because Apple is offering the iAd platform to all publishers (developers). If they had hand-picked a few to beta test, I have a feeling the supply and demand would match up. Apple knows they’re behind in the game though, so that’s probably why they’re releasing it to all developers. In the long run, I think the iAd platform will be a hit for advertisers and developers. Hopefully the level of ad quality doesn’t suffer so much that it affects the end user too much."

I looked in the preferences for downloads, and noticed that I was connected to their Chicago datacenter. I tried switching it to Detroit and I still got some lame speeds. Then I switched to Phoenix, Arizona. And voila: My hypothesis was that the datacenters were dying from the load of the Steam summer sale. So I tried picking a datacenter in a less sparsely populated area (Phoenix probably isn’t serving that much load compared to Chicago or New York), even though it was further away. I think my hypothesis stands. So if you’re experiencing slow downloads, try picking a datacenter that’s further away. Just wait until my download is finished first. 🙂"

I made an appointment with the Apple Store App for the Genius Bar and the guy who helped us was really cool. We explained that she just bought the refurb and it was pooping out after like 3-4 hours of use. The guy showed us some battery saving techniques (like lowering the screen brightness and turning off location services, etc). At this point I was like, “come on guy, I already know that!” Then he just gave us some paperwork to sign and a new iPod! YESSS. The awesomeness here is that he didn’t question us like we were total idiots and assumed we were right. He didn’t make us do any stupid diagnostic tests to prove we were telling him the truth. This is what set the experience apart from others, like when I call the cable company and they make me turn my modem off and on, etc. Thanks, Apple! The only thing I would’ve changed is that I scheduled the appointment for like 7:30 and they didn’t get to me until around 8. The new iPod is working a lot better, so I’m glad we went in to do the switch. In other news, I am thinking of getting an iPad, because (gasp) I was wrong . In the future I should probably forego the knee-jerk assumptions for new products before I actually try them out. I can probably just say I did it for the lulz again and go on to become the next John C Dvorak . The iPad is actually quite neat. Understanding the iPad HIG goes a long way toward appreciating it. I also wrote an iPad version of my other app, so I’d like to actually try it on a real device at some point."

        "content": "Rework , a book by 37signals (the guys who made Ruby on Rails), is a pretty simple book. It’s appropriately simple, because the book is almost entirely about simplifying things, and the positive effects of doing so. I started reading the book in a protected PDF from the Microsoft library a while back. Unfortunately the license expired before I read the whole thing, so I grabbed a copy from the Ann Arbor library and finished it up. The book is incredibly easy to read and also incredibly short. It clocks in at a deceptive 273 pages. In reality, there is probably more illustration and whitespace than actual text. It feels like 37signals took general ideas from their blog and distilled them into super short nuggets of information. I think that the ADD-like feel of the book both helps and hinders. It drives home the point that you don’t need a lot of words to explain something. You can just be simple, and it’ll work. Personally, I feel it’s too easy to blaze through the book and really forget most of what was read since it’s so fast paced. Good thing I basically read through it twice. For the most part, I agree with most of the sentiments in Rework. The general message is that you don’t have to act like every other company out there. You don’t need to be obsessed with getting big, stalking the competition, hiring billions of people, etc, because being small is actually pretty nice. You can build something that just works, and from there, improve on it. The alternative is taking forever to build a monolithic beast and then finding out you didn’t need all those features. One interesting thing that I read about in the book was in a section about having “less mass.” The book explains that: From here on out, you’ll start accumulating more mass. And the more massive an object, the more energy required to change its direction. It’s as true in the business world as it is in the physical world. What’s interesting is that my former manager who had something like 20-30 years of experience in the industry had used this analogy to explain why my former company was moving so damn slow. He’s a manager that I truly respected and it’s just kind of funny seeing how common a theme mass and inertia is. Within the context of my most recent work experience, Rework actually points out a lot of what was wrong in the culture. I could go on about it, but that’s for another post. I would encourage you to read the sections: “Meetings Are Toxic,” “Strangers at a Cocktail Party,” “Illusions of Agreement,” and “Send People Home at Five.” As for what went right, Rework did touch on some of that, too (“Focus on What Won’t Change,” and “Say No by Default”). More recently, I’ve been trying to take the ideas in Rework and apply them to whatever I’m currently doing. I released an iPhone app just a while ago that was barebones. I got a lot of good feedback and learned a bunch about how the App Store process works. A few days ago I submitted an iPad version of that app. It’s also pretty bare, but I know I have room to improve and possibly even start making money with it. I think that Rework is especially relevant if you are a “starter” type of person, or would like to have that kind of culture at work but aren’t sure how to go about it. I would suggest this book to anyone who works, though. If nothing else, it’s a good way to keep an open mind on alternative perspectives regarding business and business culture."

Apparently the reason for the $12 service fee was that my accounts weren’t properly linked. The teller asked her manager if the fee could be reversed and then told me that he could reverse the fee if I agreed to be shown how to do the online bill payment (I had to log in on their computer). I probably should have just threatened to close my accounts, but I didn’t want to waste more time. Needless to say, the experience wasn’t a good one. I’m closer to closing my Chase accounts than ever before. I’ll probably find a new bank before I do so, though. I really hate how pushy Chase is to try and get me to open more accounts, use their stupid bill pay and use their debit cards (which I never do). The worst thing is that all of these “offers” increase the line wait time and just wastes their customers’ time. Definitely not the way to do customer service.

        "content": "I received an advance copy of Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose by Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos. I am posting the book review today because it’s also the official release date of the book! It’s also the day before my birthday, but that doesn’t really have anything to do with this review. I saw Tony speak at a keynote for the SXSW conference in 2009. The key components of that talk have stuck with me ever since. He basically argued that companies should act more like people. Since they’re made of people, they need to act more holistically while considering more than just revenues. His company, Zappos , has the goal of delivering WOW experiences through service. Basically it’s to make people happy through unbeatable customer service. I was glad to see that Tony decided to distill that talk (and much more) into book form a little more than a year after his SXSW talk. The book is mostly a narrative about Tony’s path to becoming an entrepreneur, angel investor, and eventually CEO of Zappos and getting bought by Amazon.com. I say this book is mostly narrative because about halfway through it starts becoming something else. The narrative is funny and quirky, something I’d expect from a guy whose company has a core value of “Create Fun and a Little Weirdness.” He talks about buying worms for a worm farm, then starting a mail order button empire as a kid, which led to selling pizza in college and then creating LinkExchange (which I totally remember using) while working for Oracle. I feel that Tony and I share a lot in common. I also had many schemes for making money before I had a real job, like selling rocks and doing yardwork, selling Dell coupons on eBay and signing up for random online offers so I could get gift certificates to sites like CDNow (I think Amazon.com bought them). Tony writes about quitting Oracle when he felt his LinkExchange was too good of an opportunity to not devote his full time to, and quitting Microsoft when his company was sold, not waiting for his stock to vest (and losing lots of money in the process): I didn’t know what I was going to do, but I knew what I wasn’t going to do. I wasn’t going to sit around letting my life and the world pass me by. People thought I was crazy for giving up all that money… I had decided to stop chasing the money, and start chasing the passion. Having recently resigned at my own (fairly high-paying) job at Microsoft, I feel the same way. Reading this book was a lot like reading about my own life, at least until the part where he figures out what he does after qutting (I’m still figuring that out, myself). The narrative section goes up to about the point where Zappos finally ends up getting an important loan and relocates to Las Vegas. After that, the book takes a turn and starts feeling more like a business book. Tony starts including lots of email memos to show what was communicated to the employees at certain points, like when the company had to lay off some employees or when they were sold to Amazon. Different Zappos employees start writing entire sections like “Vendor Relations by Fred.” This makes the book feel much more fragmented and difficult to follow. The book becomes less about Tony and more about a shared experience. The problem is that it’s riddled with asides, lists, email memos and more. There’s really no organization towards the end of the book and it feels very much thrown together. While the lessons at the end of the book might be useful, I feel as though there could have been two separate books. One from Tony’s perspective that stays as a full narrative, and another book for business people on how to make sure their company’s culture doesn’t poison its employees. Delivering Happiness is a good book. I believe in its author and in the principles contained within. While I feel it could have been organized better, I still think everyone should read it. It’s an extremely quick read and very entertaining most of the way through. I hope that Tony Hsieh’s message of the importance of company culture reaches more people, and that people have better work experiences as a result. Disclosure: I received a free review copy of this book. My review is an honest opinion of the book. Contest rules! I’m also holding a contest because I got an additional free copy of the book to give away. If you want to win it, retweet this tweet and follow me @hungtruong (so I can DM you). I’ll randomly pick someone to send the book to once I get enough entries (after a day or so). I can only ship to the US; sorry about that!"

Then I realized that Openbook actually shows less than what Facebook does. I went over to Openbook and clicked on the query for “getting divorced.” Then I ran the same search inside of Facebook. Openbook has the same results, but Facebook also includes replies and “likes” to the status messages.

        "content": "My first iPhone application has been approved and is “ready for sale” in the Apple App Store! I decided to do a native version of Anime Nano , which already has a mobile site . This native one loads faster and also doesn’t have ads (yet). Get Anime Nano for iPhone! If you install it and play around, you’ll notice it’s really simple and lacks features. This is on purpose. Instead of spending a lot of time getting it perfect and including all features of the full website, I figured that I would release the most simple functioning app first. I read a bunch of Rework before having to return it (I borrowed a digital copy from a library). Rework basically suggested that software be light and easy to use, and I think Anime Nano for iPhone fits well within that mentality. I plan on iterating on Anime Nano to improve it. I think enabling an iPad version would be the next logical step, as well as including things like the personalized blog list and series, and search. Anyway, if you have an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, please download Anime Nano (for free) and let me know what you think!"

        "url": "/blog/2010/04/21/questions-about-facebook-and-data-portability/",
        "content": "Something that is usually on my mind, either in the forefront or the back of it, is data portability. I like “owning” the data that I create, whether it’s from a tweet or a Facebook status message, or even more mundane like the bit of knowledge via a Last.fm scrobble that I listened to Dexter Gordon’s Wave at 3:27am on August 16, 2007 (I’m thinking this is in GMT?). The point is that data that I create is my property. I would go as far as to say that the online interactions I have, like friends’ activity that I comment on and interact with, is also my property. For example, a friend’s status message that I reply to and that ends up being a long thread. Some services make gathering my data easy. Twitter has a dead simple API and so does Last.fm. I’ve been toying around with gathering location data from Twitter, embedded in photos I take on my phone, and other sources. One website that still confuses me a bit with regards to their policies is Facebook. About two years ago, there was a semi-large fuss made over Facebook joining a Data Portability organization. Apparently it was sort of a me-too move to copy MySpace . Since then, there’s been a Stream API created and you can actually grab stuff from your “activity stream” from Facebook. The thing is, the rules are super vague and contradict each other. For example, the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities states that You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings . This makes it seem like I have the right to collect that content and information that I create, since I “own” it and have control over it. Yet the Developer Policy states: Storing and Using Data You Receive From Us You must not store or cache any data you receive from us for more than 24 hours unless doing so is permitted by the offline exception , or that data is explicitly designated as Storable Data . You must not give data you receive from us to any third party, including ad networks. You must not use user data you receive from us or collect through running an ad, including information you derive from your targeting criteria, for any purpose off of Facebook, without user consent. Unless authorized by us, your ads must not display user data – such as users’ names or profile photos – whether that data was obtained from us or otherwise. You cannot convert user data you receive from us into Independent Data (e.g., by pre-filling user information with data obtained from the API and then asking the user to save the data). Before making use of user data that may be protected by intellectual property rights (e.g., photos, videos), you must obtain permission from those who provided that data to us. You must not give your secret key to another party, unless that party is an agent acting on your behalf as an operator of your application, but you must never give your secret key to an ad network. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account identifiers. This basically says that I have to delete any information gathered within 24 hours. Facebook is making the assumption here that users are not developers and vice versa. I’m not interested in gathering other users’ data; I just want my own. And yet here are two conflicting statements. I’ve already used the Facebook Stream API in the past to collect my data. While the policy states this is not allowed, it’s basically unenforceable. What bothers me a bit is that it is against policy for me gather my own data using Facebook APIs. Twitter allows this, and even goes a step beyond by suggesting that developers cache data to improve performance. To their credit, Google has a “Data Liberation Front” whose purpose is to keep an eye on products and keep data import/export for users as a priority. I see data portability as a big issue while considering the natural lifecycle of a social networking website. As I use Facebook less and less, I still want to have a connection with those who are on it, and I want to maintain a record of what happened. I hate to think that while I “own” this data, I have no right to access it, especially if I decide to leave the service. I started writing this post before realizing that Facebook’s annual f8 conference is actually going on today! I guess I can look towards today’s news to see if anything has been announced re: data portability. EDIT: Well that was fast! I guess they removed the 24 hour limit thing during the keynote today. What this means directly to data portability is still up in the air, though."

I think we won a contest that allowed us to take a tourist flight to Mars, kind of like how people are paying big bucks to fly into orbit right now. When we got onto the shuttle (which seemed kind of small and had a random tour guide driving, like it was a bus), I realized that it’d probably take a while to get there. Like, more than 24 hours. I think that was a low estimate… At this point I really wish I had done more preparation for the trip, like maybe getting some audiobooks loaded up or at least bringing a book to read. I kinda just showed up (my Mom might’ve caused us to be late; this happens in real life). During our trip I kept feeling kind of dreadful. Like, what if we don’t come back (it was the first ever tourist trip to Mars)? And what if our pilot bus driver guy gets killed? Our bus driver/guide said that once we get to Mars, it’ll be really small, so we all have to keep our eyes peeled for it. I thought this was a load of crap, because it’s actually a pretty big planet! I think this also meant that we wouldn’t actually go onto Mars; we’d just fly over and look at it, and then go home. I guess we didn’t go directly to Mars; we stopped at a space station or something first. In the space station we had to form a huge line, for some reason. I remember reading some really specific headlines when glancing at a newspaper. One was about how the space library was charging really huge fees for interlibrary loan . Makes sense if your library is in space, I guess."

        "url": "/blog/2010/04/10/the-element-how-finding-your-passion-changes-everything-book-review/",
        "content": "I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about work, passion, fulfillment, etc. Maybe I spoke too soon when I wrote about not having a Quarterlife Crisis ! So I picked up this book, “The Element,” about discovering your passion. Ken Robinson argues that many people who are bad or disinterested in what they do just haven’t figured out what they’re good/passionate about, or have given up on pursuing the things they “should” be doing. Once people find that special something, they find a positive feedback loop. They like doing it so they do it more, and they get better at it. They probably also get external positive feedback, etc. With this virtuous cycle, they can achieve super awesome things. That’s the book in a nutshell. And I really didn’t have to read the whole book to see all the many permutations of this idea over and over again. I think this book really could’ve been a magazine article (maybe it started as one), rather than an entire book. I feel as though Robinson was scraping the bottom of the barrel at some points trying to fill the thing up. The writing is a bit simplistic (probably to cater to the lowest common denominator demographic), and in some parts it’s just plain bad. Here are some instances that I noticed. Upon describing a woman who dropped out of college when she had her kids, then went back to college, graduated and was offered a big job: By then, she was having trouble in her marriage, and she filed for divorce. This was a difficult time for Susan. Really, Ken? No shit! Another completely non-sequitur to start a paragraph in a section about a crisis in human resources: At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, there was hardly anyone around. It really sounds like you could’ve pulled this quote from a third-grade World History essay. On top of the patronizing language, the author seems to go off on tangents that have barely anything to do with the subject matter. Overall, I do agree with the basic message of the book. I just wish it was more focused and concise. Four stars for concept; two stars for content."

I was trying to think of a way to salvage the rest of the broth and I decided to try to make some soup. Back in Highschool, my friend Kate used to bring potato cheese soup and she’d let me try some. I really liked it and she even wrote the recipe in the back of my yearbook, but I hadn’t tried to make it until now. It was way overdue. I looked online for some recipes. There were quite a few variations. I read through a bunch and came up with a plan. I went to Trader Joe’s and got a few Russet Potatoes (I think a lot of people say to use Yukon Gold), an onion, and a small block of sharp cheddar cheese. It was like $6 in all or something. I put the broth (there was about 2 or 3 cups left) into a big pot and started boiling it. I chopped up the potatoes into cubes and half the onion onto little pieces. Then I threw them in the pot and let them boil for a while. The recipes say 20 minutes or so but I think I did less, maybe 15? Then I separated the potato from the broth, and placed the pieces onto a plate. I smashed them with a fork. It was surprisingly easy to smash them. I mixed them back in with the broth and let it simmer while I grated the cheddar cheese. I added about .5 lbs (the package said .67 lbs of cheese and I used about 3/4 of it. Maybe I should’ve used less. Or maybe more? Anyway, the cheese melted well with the soup and it turned out really good. I think maybe there was a bit too much broth, so the soup was a bit soupier than i would’ve liked. But overall it was a huge success and I’ll now be eating leftover potato cheese soup for a few days."

        "url": "/blog/2010/03/20/sxsw-2010-my-panel-moderator-experience/",
        "content": "I got back from SXSW 2010 a few days ago, and I thought I would write a post about what it was like to moderate a panel while it’s fresh in my mind. As you may know, my panel submission, “ Student Startups: Entrepreneurship in the University ” was selected to be a real panel at SXSW 2010! From the time that I knew it was accepted, I sprung into action and got my panelists together. Ellen from Alight Learning , Ben from Olark (formerly Hab.la) and Rishi from Underground Printing . While I did my research beforehand (I was a student entrepreneur myself, to begin with), I felt the need to cram some preparation a few days before the panel, too. I guess I should have gotten everything ready before the conference started, but I also wanted to get proper feedback from my panelists. One way I prepared to moderate was by reading a few blog posts on the subject that were linked to from the Speaker FAQ . Most agree that one should not over-prepare the panelists. You want the discussion to happen during the panel itself and not before. In the hour before the panel, inside the green room, I had to sort of referee the panelists to avoid discussing too much. Most also agree that the moderator needs to do the most homework. I had to come up with the focus of my panel, questions to ask to reach that focus, and I had to be prepared to follow up with more questions depending on where the conversation went (which included asking questions to get the discussion back on track if it was going off on a tangent). At first the panel was going to be about details: where to get money, what kind of corporate structure to use, etc. When I started thinking about the potential panel attendee, I realized that these questions would probably be really boring and unnecessary. I tried to frame my panel from the viewpoint of a college undergrad who just wants to get something started. I hoped that by the end of the panel, at least one person in the room would decide to give startups a try, or at least be excited enough by the idea to do more research into it. My biggest worries were that no one would come, or that too many people would come. I also worried that people would be mean on the backchannel (as I have witnessed during other panels). I worried that I would not have enough questions to ask and that there would be a bunch of dead silence. Luckily, none of these things happened. The audience was a good size, I treated the audience with respect from the beginning and asked them to do the same on our hashtag, and my panelists were really interesting and led me to ask other followup questions. I don’t think there was much filler content at all. Probably the only truly stressful part of the process was when Rishi called me the day before the panel and told me he couldn’t make it, by no fault of his own. I had to find a replacement panelist within less than 24 hours! Luckily, I am an entrepreneur at heart and rose to the challenge. I went to the trade show floor and started asking the startup-looking companies if their founder was there, and if so, if he/she had started a company while in school. I got incredibly lucky the first time I asked, at Tungle.me ‘s booth. I ended up meeting Marc Gingras , a really awesome guy who ended up working out perfectly. Marc rounded out the panel as the guy who started a company during the dotcom boom. He also has experience being a VC and doing other startups after his first. I really can’t thank Marc enough for spending his time sitting on my panel and helping it become a great success. My basic strategy during the panel was to break the ice by asking the audience to participate a bit first. I stole this from the App-Vertising panel I saw a few days before. I asked who in the audience were students, investors, entrepreneurs or educators. Next, I had my panel introduce themselves and then I introduced myself. I started with an easy question: “I am a student who wants to get into startups, what should I do?” From there I listened to the panelists and tried to anticipate where the discussion was heading. I had a few points I wanted to hit, so if I heard something that related to another topic, I segued into it. For example, I might’ve said “Ben, you mentioned finding your co-founders at a student group, did anyone else have a similar experience? If not, where did you find your co-founders?” The backchannel on Twitter also provided a good source of questions. I’m really glad that people asked them because it kept the conversation relevant to what people wanted to know and it gave me a chance to save my questions for a more relevant time to ask them. I haven’t gotten the official feedback on the panel yet, but I think that it was overall a success. Very few people left in the during the panel and many people were nice enough to come up and talk to me and the panelists afterward. I wish I could have talked to every single person to see if the panel was helpful, but I think they had to run to the keynote right after (and so did we)! I really hope that the panel inspired some people to take a chance and become an entrepreneur. I think that if one person became more inspired after hearing the panel, our mission was definitely accomplished. While the process was a bit stressful and required a fair amount of work, I’d love to either moderate or participate in a panel again, someday. I’ve got to start thinking of panel ideas for SXSW 2011! [Photo credit: Chris Norred]"

        "content": "I have lots of material to post from this year’s SXSW 2010 Interactive Festival. First thing’s first, though: I need to document all of the celebrities that I sighted and took pictures with! The first celebrity of South By came fairly early. While leaving the Windows Phone party on Friday night, I ran into my old friend Pete Cashmore . I can call him my old friend because we used to be in that 9rules thing together and he wrote about Notecentric and MapsKrieg on his Mashable blog. I chatted him up a bit to see if he remembered me (he either did or was being nice). And he was pretty nice, too! He told me about the Mashable party at Buffalo Billiards (that I didn’t actually get a chance to go to). Then I had to run off because there was a free taco truck nearby and Pete was trying to get into the Speakeasy anyway. That same night I also spotted Scobleizer , but I didn’t talk to him because I was looking for additional Korean tacos and I already met him last year. I also met some Jonas Brothers but later found out they were just cardboard cutouts. The next night, at the Frog Design opening party, I was waiting in line and met a cool guy named Mike D’Amico . The line was for a photo booth. I guess we’re both pretty narcissistic. Anyway, some gals ran up to mike and started talking to him. They seemed strangely familiar. I thought they were maybe in a TV show or small-time movie actors. Once they started handing Threadless buttons to me I realized the magnitude of the situation. They were Threadless t-shirt models!!! Kristen and Colleen were both really nice. I took a picture with them, Threadless style, though I didn’t have a Threadless shirt on at the time. We exchanged business cards and I promised them I’d wear my Three Keyboard Cat Moon shirt the next day. Sunday was a slow day for celebrity sightings but that was probably due to the fact that I was busy preparing for my panel the next day. Monday turned out to be a good day, both for my panel (more on that in a later post!) and for celebrity sightings! My friends Sameer and Maureen and I were heading to the 20×2 party but found the foursquare party along the way. The line was huge but somehow we became VIPs by drinking some Vitamin Water and having our pictures taken. The party had a bunch of tables with t-shirts and schwag lined up. I got a Brizzly, Foursquare and something else (some kind of iPhone app company) shirt. While at the foursquare table I saw that iJustine girl. I talked with her for a second and got a picture with her. She seemed nice enough, but kinda had other things to do besides talk to me. She probably needed to go stream her life or something, whatevs! danah boyd was also at the party but someone was chatting her up relentlessly. Sameer got her to say “Hi” (he’s met her before) but she had to run to the VIP area or something. She also seemed nice but kinda busy. Later that night, Sameer and I were in the line for the Mens room and ran into the CEO of Twitter, Evan Williams ! He was wearing the same dress shirt/sweater combo as during his keynote earlier in the day. Sameer asked for his business card and Ev nicely obliged. We didn’t get a picture. That might’ve been a bit too odd, given we were waiting for the bathroom. I heard that Ashton Kutcher was also at the party but I didn’t head up to the VIP area to check him out. Overall it was a very good year for celebrity sightings at SXSW. I really wanted to meet Cashmore last year, so it’s great I finally got to talk with him a bit this time. Next year I hope to run into even more famous celebrities like Guy Kawasaki or Leo Laporte! See you soon, SXSW 2011!"

        "content": "Recently I’ve become really interested in letterpress. It’s basically a form of printing on a movable type machine that results in a print that’s sort of embossed as well. I recently bought a set of cards from Vince Letterpress : Meaghan was really nice because she had originally sent me two blue cards and a yellow. I told her that I had intended to frame them as a set of three and she printed a red one and sent it to me for free. It was really good of her to do that. I think the reason I like Letterpress is that it leaves a very tangible impression. The object itself is a representation of something that’s not quite 2d, but not quite 3d either. In an age of all things digital, when it’s so easy to reproduce something by printing it out on an inkjet or laser printer, it’s nice to have something that’s a bit more difficult to recreate. Sure, someone could scan the card and print it out, but there would be something lost in the translation from a physical object with physical properties to a digital representation back to a physical object. I like that the printer works by smashing into the paper. It creates something that’s different every time. I like that you can touch the card and feel its texture. I like that you can see it from different angles in the light, and how it changes a bit. In the example above, I really like the colors. So far my hobby consists of collecting letterpress’ed stuff. I’d really like to take a letterpress printing class some time. It seems like it’d be a good way to balance my love of new technology with some older-fashioned tech."

        "content": "I recently picked up a copy of Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture . As a self proclaimed cheapskate (I picked this book up from the library, after all!), I was very interested in the subject. Ellen Shell does some in-depth research behind the psychology of why we (humans) love cheap stuff. Some of us go bonkers finding good deals, even when it’s not really economical (driving miles to save a few cents on gas). I’ve displayed this behavior in the past, buying videogames when they’re on sale while never having enough time to even finish the ones I’ve started, let alone the new ones I bought. I’ve chilled out a little when it comes to randomly buying stuff, but the allure of a good deal is still strong. There are also some fun experiments described. Like the one where a person is presented with a crappy Hershey’s chocolate for 1 penny or an upgrade to a premium chocolate for 25 cents. Most people pick the premium. But when the price of the Hershey’s drops to the magical price of “free,” most people go for the free option instead of the “better” 25 cent deal. Shell also describes the history of the discount store. Originally goods were priced according to quality. It was easy to tell that something made well cost more. But people started selling crappy quality goods at super low prices (and thrive on volume). This caused the more expensive sellers to go out of business. The super low prices made poor people feel like kings, being able to afford new socks instead of repairing their old ones! People could afford to just buy new things, which was good because the new stuff they bought would fall apart pretty quickly (think H&amp;M). The basic thesis of the book is that people love cheap things, but cheap things come at a cost. The lower class will always be involved (and basically abused), because if you paid people well to make things, the things themselves would need to cost more. This means that working retail sucks. It also means that the conditions for the people making the cheap stuff (mostly in China and Vietnam and other poorer countries) sucks really bad. If people saw what their need for cheap led to, they would probably be willing to pay a bit more to improve the quality of life of the people making their things. Sadly, most people don’t think about it because it is very out of sight. One interesting section of the book concerned Ikea. I’ve always really liked Ikea because they make fashionable stuff and it is, indeed, cheap. I’ve had issues with their “stainless steel” items from China that rust like the surface of Mars. Overall though, I have a lot of love for their furniture. Learning that they use a hella lot of lumber and their “planned obsolescence” mentality leads to waste makes me reconsider. I’m not sure they’re the devil, but I think that next time I need to furnish an apartment, I may instead think of Crate &amp; Barrel (which has way cute stuff!). As for getting rid of my own cheap habits altogether, I don’t think I can do it. I will say that I am lucky to have the luxury of being able to choose to spend more or not. I don’t shop at Wal-Mart because I think it’s kind of evil and exploitative. One interesting thing to note is how well Wal-Mart does during a recession due to its focus on crazy low prices… I do shop at PCC because it’s good quality food and Michael Pollan says I should spend more on healthy food. I can’t really justify paying more just for the sake of paying more, however. The book closes with a story about a company that goes against cheap culture. It’s a grocery store that focuses on customer service instead of price. People really love the store and are willing to pay more because of it. The store actually has fans. I think this is a great example of competing on another factor and really kicking butt doing it. I think that other companies that do this are Apple (for selling high quality products that people develop emotional bonds to) and Zappos (for focusing on customer service above price and making customer happiness their main goal). There is a special place in our brain that loves cheap, but I think there are also other things that are important to people. Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture is a really interesting look at where we are and how we ended up this way. It says something interesting about our culture, our brains and ultimately our nature. If you buy just one book this year, then Cheap is probably the book for you!

        "url": "/blog/2010/02/21/the-bird-and-the-bee-my-new-favorite-band/",
        "content": "I have been getting really into this band called “ The Bird and The Bee .” They are composed of Inara George and Greg Kurstin. I’m not sure which one is The Bird and which one is The Bee. Or if it’s just a band name. I bet they get asked that a lot. I’m guessing that Inara is the bee, because almost all bees (the worker ones) are female. Anyway, what was I writing about? My music-listening tendencies have been pretty unfocused recently. I just kinda try out whatever music I hear about. The last artist I sorta latched onto was Ingrid Michaelson after seeing her in concert in Ann Arbor back in 2007. I listened to some Andrew Bird but didn’t get super into him or anything. The Bird and The Bee is the first band whose albums I am listening to over and over again, and getting really psyched about. I even bought their single to hear some new songs. How crazy is that!? I will now recount how I first became acquainted with this band. I am not ashamed to admit this is a very “ Stuff White People Like ” story. I was at The Gap, trying on some clothes in the fitting room. Then I heard this song that sounded pretty neat. So I used Shazam to figure out what it was. It turns out it was “You’re a Cad.” This happened on November 29th, 2009 at exactly 1:51pm Pacific Time. Thanks for the extreme data accuracy, Shazam! Anyway, I made a mental note to check out the band, after purchasing a cheap sweater. I actually don’t remember if I bought a sweater, but details make a story more interesting. I put a few of their albums on hold at the Seattle Public Library and loaded them onto my iPhone to listen to on my commute to work. The rest is history. The Bird and The Bee is probably so interesting to me because they have such a unique sound. Their website describes them as a mix of “Brazilian Tropicalia, 60s psychedelic pop, and sparse electronic beats.” Inara has a wispy yet super-focused voice that really adds a lot to the complex arrangements. To say that their “sound” truly defines them would be a disservice, though. In addition to a neat sound, their songs stand out because they’re really well composed. I think a lot of current alternative music focuses on the ambience, and not a whole lot on a coherent melody. The Bird and The Bee’s music not only contains some neat melodies, they also do some fun things like layering melodies on top of each other, making canon-ish things happen. Their songs actually start somewhere and build up to something. Maybe I’m just being a fanboy, but I really appreciate the songwriting skills of the duo. At this point in the post, I should really just let you listen to their music. Here’s one of their songs along with a music video: Polite Dance Song. The concept of the song is wacky and the video fits it quite well. They also have an awesome cover of How Deep is Your Love on the single that I got . Oh, and a wacky song about a weeaboo’s love for Japan . The Bird and The Bee have a new album coming out, apparently a tribute album to Hall and Oates ! I should probably just pre-order this as I’ve liked everything else they’ve put out so far."

As I approached, I noticed an army of people in blue shirts, just waiting to help anyone who walked in. I soon realized that they were just cardboard cutouts. Neat. I walked in and looked around at the unibody Macbooks (the white ones that are now more curvy) and checked the battery life on them. They apparently get something like 5 hours (when I unplugged them and the computer actually calculated) versus my MacBook Pro that gets like 2 if I’m lucky. Then I walked around and noticed something: Apple printed the backs of the cardboard cutouts! They’re in the same poses in the back as they are on the front! If the backs had been blank, I probably wouldn’t have even noticed. But Apple pays so much attention to detail that they decided that peoples asses must be printed. It is likely due to this level of detail that Apple is succeeding where other companies fail hard. I don’t care what anyone says about Apple, they care more about the user/customer experience than probably anyone else out there."

        "content": "As a first (or second, however you may define it) Asian American, I have often pondered about race, heritage and what it means to be an Asian Born in America. I’m an ABC. Eric Liu’s The Accidental Asian: Notes of a Native Speaker is a collection of essays about the Asian American condition on a number of subjects and contexts. Eric Liu and I share a few things in common. We’re “Asians” living in America who have been well-assimilated into society. I found Eric’s experiences as he describes them to be very similar to my own: his parents learned English well enough so that he could learn it as his primary language. His parents encouraged him to be studious but didn’t push in any particular direction. He had to learn how to fit into American society, but it seems he had a head start. He feels that he has lost a lot of his ancestral culture, and possibly made up for it by absorbing the local culture. In many ways, I feel like I can relate with him. Liu’s essays range from the state of the Asian American as the “new Jews” to the idea of Chinatown as a place/symbol to how he himself assimilated into American culture. While some are very relevant today, I felt as though he used a few too many dated references, especially to the Clinton Administration “ Chinagate ” scandal. I was 13 at the time, for crying out loud! The interesting ideas were about old Asian ways versus Asian American ways and the American perception of Asian Americans. Since Asians were good at math, Liu studied English. Liu seemed to do things to fight the stereotype, but in doing so he reinforced that the stereotypes actually mattered. I personally feel as though I am an American, first and foremost. I am obviously Chinese (though my name is Vietnamese), but that doesn’t define everything I am. This is especially true because I was born in the United States. While I have Asian friends, I also have many White friends, and those are the people who I had identified with when I was a kid. I don’t think I even had a grasp of what being Asian versus White was as a young kid. In high school I remember seeing cliques of Asian kids, the ones who were either ESL or less proficient in English than in their parent’s language. On one hand I felt that it was nice that they had their groups to feel a part of (better than being alone), yet on the other hand I felt bad that they were pretty much segregated from the rest of the school and the other students. I guess on some level, though, all cliques had the same properties. I sometimes felt strange walking past the Asian kid cliques. “Do they feel like I’m a traitor?” I used to think. So goes the life of an assimilated Asian. In one essay, Liu points out that while Asian Americans are thought of as the “model minority” today, it wasn’t always so. There’s the whole Chinese being kicked out of Seattle thing, and the Japanese being forced into internment camps. He pondered something that I also pondered directly after 9/11. If an Asian country were to go to war with the United States, what would it mean to Asian Americans living here? I would like to think that everything would be fine, but Liu points out that we’re still not quite as assimilated in American culture as, say, Jewish people. Liu calls Asian Americans the “new Jew” because apparently we are described in the same way as Jewish people were 50 years ago: studious, unimaginative, etc. Maybe that explains why I have so many Jewish friends. Even so, I tend to disagree with Liu a bit on this point since another of his main points brings this link down: Asian Americans are really an amalgamation of a demographic. Within Asian Americans you have Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, Taiwanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans etc. Are we all expected to act as one sub-minority? Does that really make sense? Isn’t it bad enough that most White people can’t tell us apart? One of more interesting points that Liu brings up is that is is yet to be seen how the “Asian American” will organize and identify as a national group, or if it even will. I think I started reading The Accidental Asian because I wanted to gain a little more perspective on the Asian American condition. It’s something that I usually just ignore. Of course I acknowledge that I’m Asian, but I also realize that among being an Asian American, I am many things. I am a Computer Scientist. I am a Information Scientist. I am an engineer. I am a tinkerer. Maybe I’m too young to really concern myself with race issues. Or maybe it’s the fact that being Asian American has never gotten in my way when I wanted to achieve something. Perhaps it’s even helped. Without conflict, I think people tend to focus on other aspects of their lives. This may be why Eric Liu’s observations all seem a bit trivial. He grew up fairly privileged, attended school at Yale and then went on to be a speechwriter for Clinton. There was no real mention of adversity in his essays. Out of the book, I think the worst thing to happen to him was his Asian hair (I can relate). Overall, I think The Accidental Asian is a good read for anyone interested in Asian American issues. Though it is a bit dated, I feel there are enough universal themes for it to still be relevant. I would have preferred a bit more analysis on things like gender issues (Asian male stereotypes and Asian female stereotypes) and how they play into how we see our roles as Asian Americans. As a final note, Eric Liu married a White woman, but his book actually contains less tips on dating white women than this book . Unfortunately, I will need to seek another guide to get more information on the topic."

        "title": "In Defense of Food: Book Review",
        "url": "/blog/2010/01/31/in-defense-of-food-book-review/",
        "content": "According to Michael Pollan, food has been disappearing from supermarkets around the country. It’s being replaced by food-products, which are not quite food. In Defense of Food argues that we should live by some simple rules: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” I had previously read The Omnivore’s Dilemma , and I figured I would continue my food reading with Pollan’s next book. While Omnivore was a hefty 411 pages, Defense is a very quick read; about 200 pages. Whereas The Omnivore’s Dilemma was a narrative adventure, following the path of a few meals, In Defense of Food is more about the history of our attitudes about food. Pollan explores the policy changes that gave way to subsidized farming and “nutritionism,” a form of reductionist science to ultimately dictate what Americans should eat. In that sense, it’s a much simpler book. A lot of the lessons learned in Omnivore’s Dilemma are in this one as well. In Defense of Food seems to focus more on the effect of the “food” we’re eating on our health, rather than the actual production of the food. The second half of the book goes into detail on Pollan’s rules about eating. These are simple tips, like avoiding food with too many ingredients, or ingredients that you can’t pronounce. If you follow all of them, your health should improve dramatically. It’s a bit of a challenge, though, to go against the American culture of fast, processed, artificial foods. For example, as I’m writing this, I am staring at a package of Pepperidge Farms Goldfish Crackers. They contain such ingredients as “thiamin mononitrate” and “monocalcium phosphate,” so I shouldn’t really consider eating them. But they’re damn good, too! Since I moved out of my parents house and began making all of my eating decisions, I’ve tried to strike a balance between healthy and delicious. I’m pretty sure I could manage both, but delicious/easy tends to win over delicious/lots of work. It’s really encouraging to see these food rules, though, in a simple form. I think that I can slowly make a few small victories in my eating (and food shopping) habits that will eventually steer me into better health. One thing I have noticed in many of the books that I’ve been reading recently is the attack on reductionist science. The argument basically states that science relies heavily on breaking complex systems into smaller, easier to understand parts. These parts can be broken down further until they’re atomic, more or less. Reductionist science believes that once everything is broken down and understood on the atomic level, the system as a whole is understood, QED. The unfortunate proof is that systems are complex, and no one ever understood how a car works by overanalyzing the air freshener. In Defense of Food argues that “nutritionism,” the food science equivalent to redictionism, is one contributor to our total lack of common sense when it comes to food. We process foods so they lose nutrients, then we pump them back in. But nutrients might interact with others. Fiber slows the absorption of something, certain vitamins are fat-soluble. Pollan’s solution is to just eat food that isn’t processed to remove all of the nutrition. Barabasi’s book also argues against scientific reductionism. Or at the very least it details the shortcomings of it. One example is that while we’ve fully mapped the human genome, it’s the interactions between genes that really matter. The fact that networks are a great way to model complex systems makes me excited about studying them. Am I getting off topic? In any case, In Defense of Food is a nice companion to The Omnivore’s Dilemma. I’d suggest you read the latter before you read the former. IDoF is a quick read and highly recommended for anyone who eats food or food-like substances for nourishment."

        "content": "Edit: Cool, looks like my blog got posted to from some hack blog called “PCWorld.” I will note that while it is easy to make dumb predictions about the future, it is even easier to go back and look at the incorrect ones. If everyone made accurate predictions about the iPhone, it would’ve existed before Apple invented it. Please keep the comments section nice, or I might pull an Engadget. My mom reads this, you know! Once upon a time, I made a post about how the iPhone was going to fail . I did it mostly for lulz and also to try and get on the front page of Digg. Seriously, that post was diggbait ! That was back when people still went to Digg and people still tried to get on the main page of Digg. The interesting thing is that post got a lot more commentary than other technology posts I made before and since then. Today, I feel the urge to write a post about how the iPad thing will fail. This time, I actually mean it. In essence, the iPad is just a giant iPhone with no camera, no microphone and no phone. What it gains in screen size it loses in a lot of core functionality. It doesn’t even really bother me so much that they took out important features. It’s what they left in. The iPad works on the iPhone OS. This could be a good idea, except that they really didn’t consider that making a device four times bigger might introduce some design considerations. The iPad is quite literally a giant iPhone. Most iPhone games, etc (at least, those not requiring a mic or camera) are supposed to work on it. But when you think about it, what games using the accelerometer will actually work out of the box when you’re dealing with something 1.5 pounds heavy and clunkier than a handheld device? Shaking a tablet is different from shaking a small phone. I’m not sure if the designers were just lazy or if they didn’t care at all about the new scale. The mail app looks like it was hacked into the iPad. It should look like it was designed for the thing, but for some reason we still have the really thin column and a bunch of whitespace. WTF? I suppose that Apple needed to release the thing and do it with an unpolished product. Some apps look well designed, like the iBooks one (clever naming convention there, Apple), but most look like they were just stretched to fit the larger resolution. A lot of companies could get away with this, but I think people expect more from Apple. If Apple wants to control the entire end user experience, they should take that responsibility with a burden. My predictions: Apple will get better at designing apps for the iPad. The best ones will come from them. Most developer apps will look like crap on the iPad. A few will “get it.” Those ones will be successful. Most developers will probably find developing (quality) apps too difficult on the damn thing, give up. People will realize that they don’t want a computing device that only allows Apple-approved software on it. They’ll stick with the Macbook, which can do much more than an iPad and runs any third-party software, including Flash and Firefox."

        "content": "A book that I read recently, Connected, made reference to another book called The Victorian Internet . I checked it out of the library and ended up reading it pretty quickly. Despite the name, the Victorian Internet is not a sci-fi alternate history novel. It’s about the history of the internet before the internet: the telegraph. Much of the book is centered around how the telegraph came to exist. It describes the setup of optical telegraph systems where numerous towers were constructed to the laying of thousands of miles of electrical cable, some across the ocean. This part of the book was mostly a bore to me. While it’s nice to know that there was a long process to standardize codes and international regulations, etc, it just isn’t that salient to me. I do, however, appreciate the author’s acknowledgment that there was a lot of bad poetry written about the telegraph. Example: ‘Tis done! The angry sea consents, The nations stand no more apart; With clasped hands the continents, Feel the throbbing of each other’s hearts. Speed, speed the cable, let it run, A loving girdle round the earth, Till all the nations neath the sun Shall be as brothers of one hearth. The book actually got interesting once it started explaining how people reacted to the telegraph. Maybe it’s a symptom of having gone to a school where sociological and technological problems merge… The name of the book implies that the telegraph had a similar effect in the 1800s that the internet did in the late 1900s. While I was reading I took note of a few things that the author described about the telegraph network that seemed very applicable today. Regarding newspapers, “James Gordon Bennett was one of many who assumed that the telegraph would actually put newspapers out of business.” Funny to think that the extinction of newspapers was predicted more than 100 years ago, and extended to lay the blame on the internet. In a way, newspapers really do seem like they are going extinct. Maybe it’s that the internet is finishing the job, as a natural extension of the telegraph. Another chapter describes love by telegraph. There’s a story of a couple who were married while 650 miles apart, one in Arizona and the other in California. Thanks, telegraph! There was also the story of the telegraph operators who were good chums together. Only once they met in real life did they realize that they were of opposite sex, and got married soon afterwards! Sorry, World of Warcraft, but telegraph did it first! One of the most entertaining descriptions was of a company that “employed thousands of operators … leading to widespread concern that too much power was concentrated in the hands of one company. [It] handled 80 percent of the country’s message traffic and was making a huge profit.” Sound like Google? It was actually Western Union, which seems like it’s being used more for Nigerian scams than legitimate business. Though I guess Google sends plenty of Nigerian spam as well… There are other examples of the internet echoing things that happened a century before it on the telegraph network. I’ll leave it to as an exercise to the reader to actually read the book. The takeaway from reading this book seems to be that the interactions that happen with humans and new enabling technologies were recorded long before the internet. History repeats itself, and if we want to know what will happen next with the internet, we might want to see what happened to the telegraph."

So it is with a heavy heart that I have to give his latest album, “ Your Songs ,” a bad review. HC Jr. is best when he’s singing jazz standards, or songs that have been creatively arranged as jazz standards, like his Christmas songs and his really cool album, “ Songs I Heard ,” which consists of a bunch of songs from kid’s movies. I really like Songs I Heard because it takes familiar songs and transforms them into something unique that Connick can work with. Your Songs pretty much seems like a cash-in album. Harry C basically loaded a bunch of popular songs into this album so that people would buy it. “Oh, it has ‘Can’t Help Falling in Love’ on it! It even has a Beatles song!” The problem with the album, and I’m not sure how the producers didn’t catch this very early in the process, is that the arrangements are so dull that Harry sounds like he’s in pain throughout the album. The arrangements don’t fit his singing style because they’re popular songs, and Harry Connick Jr. is not a pop singer. The thing that bothers me most is that this is a completely safe album. There were no risks taken in the vanilla arrangements. So what we get is a really sub-standard pop album from a really good jazz vocalist. These may be my songs, but Harry: you can keep them! (Yeah, so what if my only reason for writing this review was the cheesy last line? I’ve done worse on this blog!)"

I pity the fool who has to play Mr. T’s part while not actually being Mr. T. I bet he even has a last name with more than one character! My second concern is that people will get shot in this movie. In the TV show, no one ever got shot. They were shot at, but no bullets ever entered anyone. Actually, I think there may have been an episode where a person was shot, but I don’t think it was ever fatal. I hope that they at least make Mr. T (or the dude who’s playing him) afraid of flying. It looks like it from the scene in the plane in the trailer. It’s kind of hard to tell, but I bet he drank some drugged milk or something. Oh, and Liam Neeson as Hannibal seems kind of wrong, but maybe he can pull it off."

        "content": "It looks like I’m continuing my long list of book reviews on my blog. Here’s a review of Linked by Albert-László Barabási (yes, I copy-pasta’ed that). Linked is the story of the birth of graph theory and how early network models evolved to how we understand them today. Barabasi does a really good job of inserting character and context into the early scientists that formed the early ideas about networks. For example, he introduces Euler with a story about how he gave his nephew some lessons and worked on calculations that would some day lead to the discovery of Neptune. Oh, and he died that day, never to see the fruits of his labor. This kind of narrative is what I found lacking in Connected , and the kind I also noticed in Six Degrees . Go Barabasi! That isn’t to say that Barabasi isn’t the king of all prose. One bugaboo I kept running into while reading linked was that Barabasi seems to have a certain idiosyncrasy in his writing. To be blunt, he starts too many sentences with the word “indeed.” I’m not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but in some paragraphs he uses “indeed” twice! I think the max number on a page was three. I have taken the liberty of documenting one of these pages: Please note that this doesn’t mean I don’t like the book or Barabasi’s writing. Indeed, I just complemented his writing earlier in this review. I just think his editor needs to help him with a larger vocabulary. Besides that pet peeve, I thought the book was really well written and interesting. It had my attention up to Barabasi’s discovery of scale-free networks and the near-ubiquity of them in other systems. The book started getting a bit slow around the 13th chapter when the subjects were biology and business. I’m not sure if I was just scale-free fatigued or what. I feel the book was not balanced enough. The beginning, which consisted of a lot of history, was much more interesting than the explanations of how scale-free networks seemed to pop up everywhere. While it is a key takeaway that many of these observed properties of networks seem to be universal, it also isn’t as interesting as evolving a model of network analysis. I guess this isn’t really a fault of the author though. Also, this book was published in 2002, before many of the popular social network websites became super popular. I just looked up Barabasi on Amazon and it appears he has a book due out this year . Sweet! I think that I can safely say that I enjoyed Duncan Watts’ book more than Linked. But it also isn’t a fair comparison because I read Watts’ book first and much of the content of both authors overlaps, so I may have felt that reading Linked was redundant. Linked came before Six Degrees, so maybe a lot of Six Degrees’ success has to do with Barabasi’s book. Either way, both books were good. I’m glad I read both of them. Now that I discovered the existence of a second Barabasi book, I can look forward to reading it in April."

His diagnosis gave him 3-6 months, and for his “Last Lecture” he showed people how to live their childhood dreams. The video really caught on! I watched it quite a while ago and it really is incredibly inspiring. You can see it here . The Last Lecture: The Book, goes into further detail on things that Pausch touched upon during the lecture. It’s a more thought-out version that makes sense as a book, since a four or five-hour lecture might be a bit rough on the audience. Randy’s main points are that if you try hard enough, you can get what you want. Persistence pays off. Enabling others to succeed is often more rewarding than serving yourself. Throughout his life, Randy got to do all sorts of stuff that he dreamed about since he was a kid. Maybe it’s a product of having a one-sided view of Randy’s life, but it seems like this dude is a total saint! He even jokes about it in the book. I personally think that he probably was a really awesome person who deserved everything that he worked for. While it really is sad that he died, he crammed in a bunch of cool stuff in his life! To his credit, he says in his book that the thing that bothered him the most was that his kids wouldn’t be able to grow up with him as a presence. It’s really wonderful that some people can be so selfless, even when they have a very limited time limit. I think we all need a reminder sometimes that our time is limited. In some cases, it can be extremely short . One thing that I have struggled with, given the reminders I have had that life is short, is that I really get antsy when I don’t feel like I’m moving forward. I can appreciate that patience is a virtue, but I also think that being proactive is one of the best things a person can do for him/herself. I often think of my lifespan as a progress bar (think a file transfer dialog box or something) that is always moving towards 100%. But you can’t see how close you are to 100% (unless you’re Randy). So how much of my life would I like to spend unhappy? 1%? That’s more than a year, if you assume &lt;100 year lifespan. Oh, I guess I’m not really reviewing this book anymore, am I? One thing I noticed about the audiobook version is that it’s not Randy reading the book to you. This makes sense since I’m sure Randy would have rather spent the studio time doing stuff with his family. But it’s also kind of weird listening to this dude who isn’t Randy talk about all of his awesome life experiences. Maybe they could’ve just recorded all the possible syllables Randy could make, then piece them into words and sentences? Nah. Anyway, The Last Lecture is a really nice companion to the actual last lecture. It puts things into perspective. I personally strive to make the most out of every day. I hope I have a lot of quality time left doing the things I love. But if I don’t, at least people will know I made the most of it!"

        "content": "I just finished reading this book with a really long title: Connected: The Surprising Power of Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives . Whew. Being a connoisseur of social network research, this book was very relevant to my interests. Previously I had read Six Degrees by that Duncan Watts guy. In Connected, Christakis and Fowler argue that social networks are a natural part of our lives. We’ve evolved to be good at navigating them and using them for our needs. While it’s simple to prove our actions have an effect on people who we are directly connected to, we apparently also have an effect on the people who are connected to the people we are connected to. This effect fans out from us to our third degree contacts (friends of friends of friends). Our actions might affect others’ obesity, happiness, loneliness and promiscuousness. Conversely, people we don’t even know can affect whether we’re happy or fat (not mutually exclusive). I actually saw James Fowler talk about some research that made it into the book at a complex systems seminar at the University of Michigan back when I was a student. He focused on how happiness could spread and talked less about the fatness issue. He apparently caught a lot of flack for writing about how the obesity “epidemic” really is an epidemic. That is, the more fat friends you have, the more likely you are to become fat. You could imagine how this could make overweight people feel: like some vector for a contagious disease known as chubbiness. While the oversimplification seems funny, when you boil it down to human behaviors (as the book describes), it makes sense. People mimic each other. When everyone else around you is overweight, it’s easy to assume that behaviors that lead to weight gain is the norm. It works with lots of other things too. And that’s basically what the book amounts to. Many examples of people in networks spreading ideas, diseases, love, hate, etc. The book also touches on how technology has amplified our natural ability to network into hyper-networks. One criticism of the book I have is that it feels a bit too dry. The book is describing all kinds of interesting phenomena, but it does so in a really scientific way. Don’t get me wrong, I like science, but I also like a story in my non-fiction hardback book. Six Degrees is a good example of a great non-fiction book that tells a wonderful story. The narrative fits together well and the content is interesting. Duncan Watts is good at both science and storytelling. You could compare this against Malcolm Gladwell, who is good at telling a story but stinks at actual science. He kind of makes stuff up and jumps to conclusions that aren’t really backed by anything factual. Christakis and Fowler (which one did more writing?) are great at the science but the story lacks a clear narrative. Extending the idea for Pasteur’s Quadrant , Gladwell is in the “only story” quadrant, Christakis/Fowler seem to be closer to the “only science” quadrant, and Watt sits pretty well in “story + science” quadrant. Freakanomics authors Dubner and Levitt seem to fit into “story + science” though sometimes I feel they like to jump to conclusions like Gladwell does. If I were a researcher-cum-book-writer, I think I’d like to sit in that Watts quadrant myself. Overall, I think the book is compelling and interesting. The ideas from the book have already gotten my head juices flowing and thinking about future network analysis directions. Connected could definitely be improved by including some underlying narrative or cohesive theme, but it’s still worth reading as it is. Next on my plate is “ Linked ” by the guy who was named after that preferential attachment network model thing. Or was it the other way around? I just realized that the set of names for these network analysis books is growing smaller day by day! We’ve already seen books called “Linked,” “Connected,” “Nexus,” and “Six Degrees.” I wonder what the next one will be called? “Affixed?” “Conjoined?” “Hooked Up?” Maybe I should claim the name of my book before someone else does."

The first part of my dream was at some kind of museum. It was a place where I had gone as a kid. I saw a hallway with a bunch of mechanical educational arcade type games. They were old. I think one was of Dick and Jane. I felt the kind of nostalgia that you get going to a place you used to frequent as a kid but rarely as an adult. Think back to elementary school when they’d send you to the same place every year or semester. Like the natural history museum for me. The museum quickly got boring so my dream transitioned me to shopping at a grocery store. I think it was Meijer. Shopping got boring in the dream (which strangely never happens in real life) and I resorted to riding my shopping cart around with another dude who kinda seemed like my friend Matt Strand. But I don’t think it was him. Then some security guards came up to us with “energizer” brand binders (I could tell because they were drumming them like the energizer bunny, except vertically because the bunny has a bass drum and these guys were playing them like snares). They were going to take us to the manager’s office on the 9th floor or something. I tried to make small talk with the guards. Like “I bet a lot of people mess with the shopping carts and ride on them!” I was trying to make it appear less lame that a 26 year old got caught goofing off. Then my second snooze alarm woke me up. It seems impossible that my long dream happened in the span of 10 minutes but I guess that’s how our brains work!"

        "content": "I brought home a bundle of joy yesterday. No, I did not adopt a child or animal. But I do have a new pet: the iRobot Roomba 530 vacuum-cleaning robot! I’ve wanted a Roomba for a while. It makes perfect sense: it’s a robot, which I love. It’s a vacuum cleaner, which I also really like. It’s also kind of a pet. I have to say that the way it moves around is pretty cute. There are really nice, nuanced touches. Like how it beeps as it backs up when it leaves its docking station. Or how it slows down a bit when it knows it’s gonna hit the wall. And it hits the wall a lot. It also plays a sort of sad sound when it runs out of batteries. The Roomba definitely has a personality. In addition to just being a cool nerdy object, the Roomba does a pretty decent job. It picked up a bunch of gunk the first time it swept through my apartment. It seemed to prefer the living room, maybe because it was dirtiest? Or maybe because it liked the feel of the shag rug. I’m not sure. The algorithm that determines where the Roomba goes seems non-deterministic. So it ends up doing something different each time, but I think the algorithm also ensures that it hits all the spots a couple of times, and it apparently knows when it’s found some dirt, in which case it goes back for more. There are some really nice details about the design of the robot. It’s circular, which means it can turn with a 0 degree radius. It has a rotating brush thingy that helps it get stuff that’s in a corner. It’s also pretty short, so it fits under my couch and my bed. It’s only gotten stuck like once, and that was an edge case where it used a table leg as a ramp. So far I am very happy with my Roomba. It’s cute, functional and gives some serious nerd cred. I realize that it’s only a matter of time before my Roomba gains sentience and tries to kill me in my sleep. For now, though, it’s worth saving the trouble of having to vacuum by hand all the time."

        "content": "I recently re-read Ender’s Game. The first time I had read it was in middle school, probably around 6th grade. Now I’m in ~19th grade or so. Or maybe grades stop when you get a terminal degree. Anyway, I thought it’d be interesting to write up my thoughts about the book. I previously wrote about them in web form, yet the editorial quality was a bit lacking. I actually dug up the “OSC” page I had made and here’s a screencap: What you can’t see is that the red text on top blinked. I’m not even joking. So what did I think of Ender’s Game this time around? I still liked the story, but I had quite a different perspective this time. I first read the book when I was around 11-12. The same age as the protagonist when he’s at the top of his game. I must’ve read the book more for the action and less for the things happening behind the scenes. There’s a twist ending that I won’t spoil, but since I already remembered that, the story was a bit different the second time for that reason as well. I think that when I was reading the book for the first time, I wanted to be like Ender. I wanted to be a genius (I always thought geniuses were pretty interesting). I wanted to do things that other people could not. I wanted to be recognized for talent. Maybe things haven’t changed much since middle school, but I feel I have a different perspective now. I see Ender as a victim, more than a hero or a genius. One thing I didn’t find very realistic was that Ender is basically put into boot camp at the age of 6. And he takes all the punishment up until he’s something like 12 years old. Are kids just that good to listening to adults? I think that in real life, there would be a lot more AWOL kids running around asking to be sent home. I guess Ender wanted to avoid his evil brother back on Earth. The book seems much more violent this time, too. I guess that when I was in middle school, I couldn’t get enough of the gore and brutal beat-downs. But imagining little kids kick the crap out of each other is kind of sad. Lord of the Flies is cool because the kids just kind of naturally gravitate to going insane, but Ender’s Game has adults who egg them on. It’s interesting to think of what I remembered from reading the first time and how it translated to the second time I read the book. For example, there’s a description of a “desk” that Ender uses to play a realistic video game. Ender goes from environment to environment, killing giants and being killed in numerous ways. I remember imagining the game looking something like Mario 64, since that was what was around at the time. This time I thought of it as much more realistic. The interesting part is that the game’s specifics were never really described. Your imagination was required to fill in the blanks and the image in my head ended up being different than before. I may or may not continue reading the Ender Wiggin series of books. I remember not liking the next book in the series as much as the first, then quitting in the middle of the third (or simply sleepwalking through it and forgetting the entire plot). Pair that with the fact that Orson Scott Card has some very negative beliefs that I don’t agree with and it’s hard for me to get into his books. I’ll give Ender’s Game **** (pretty good). I guess I’ve become more critical in my advanced age."

        "content": "I’ve sort of been slacking with my Wii Fit schedule, but I just got Wii Fit Plus to see if I could inject some freshness into the routine. Wii Fit Plus is the pseudo sequel to Wii Fit, which includes a few extra activities and some new features as well. One of the first things I noticed was that the female trainer (which I usually use) is showing a bit more skin! Take a look at some comparison shots: Before: After: I also like her new hairsyle. I wonder. If Wii Fit Plus means that the female trainer shows some more skin, will Wii Fit Plus Plus have the female trainer go topless? I guess we have to wait to find out. One new feature that I was excited about was the ability to set up your own routines. So instead of picking each activity one by one, you can save a bunch and just go through them quickly without interruption. This should have been a cool feature, but it was ruined because picking an activity automatically selects the lowest number of reps, and I do the higher number of reps for almost every strength training activity. For example, I do 10 push-up side plank reps. But selecting it in the routine menu automatically picks 6. You could theoretically pick the exercise twice, but that would give you 12 reps. Plus you have to stop and start again (I thought initially the program would be smart enough to just combine them into one exercise). Nintendo lost a lot of my respect for how badly they handled this feature. There are a lot of different ways they could have designed this, all better than the way they did design it. They could have just combined reps as I figured they should. They could also just ask you how many reps you wanted when you picked an exercise. The added complexity would be justified by the fact that you’d only have to do it once. They could have asked for default rep values somewhere else. But instead the interaction designers (I’m assuming they have them, but now I wonder if they really do) at Nintendo decided to pull this shit. Maybe you can tell that I’m pretty unhappy about this feature. In the end, I think Nintendo err’ed on the side of simplicity, which ends up pleasing nobody. I usually like the way Nintendo products are designed, and for the most part I think Wii Fit Plus is designed well, but this feature was just not fully baked. I think I am going to email Nintendo and try and get an actual response on why this feature was done so badly. Overall, Wii Fit Plus is better than Wii Fit because it just adds new features. I’d question whether they are really worth the extra $20 that the upgrade costs."

        "content": "So I saw They Might Be Giants in concert last night. This was a super special show where they played all of the songs from their album Flood plus some other songs as filler. There was actually an opener called “Guggenheim Grotto.” Their music wasn’t too bad. But it seemed really inappropriate as an opener to TMBG. Like their songs were about love and pretty serious without any funny lyrics at all. You could kind of tell the crowd was not into them. I felt they should’ve had a more appropriate opener, but oh well. I guess there aren’t really a bunch of bands that are like TMBG and could open for them. They didn’t actually go on stage til around 10pm, opening with some kind of song about elements. I haven’t listened to their kid’s albums, so this one was new to me. Then they did some other songs before launching into Flood. Along the way they also did some weird puppet show, but it seemed like they had less random stage stuff than the last concert I saw , where they channeled a dead person or something. For the most part they played songs from Flood in sequence, though for some reason they rearranged Racist Friend and maybe also Particle Man. I think some of the fans were like “WTF” because of that. Personally I’ve listened through Flood so many times that it seems like one giant song. So any break in the sequence is pretty noticeable. While I like the concept of playing a whole album for a concert (plus other songs), in practice it seems kind of absurd. Some songs just don’t make sense live, like Hearing Aid or Minimum Wage. But in the spirit of experimentation and randomness I can accept it. While Flood is a really good album, I would’ve liked to hear more songs from other albums, too. They did play She’s An Angel, which was cool. And Famous Polka, The Mesopotamians (which I guess they use a lot as a pseudo closer), Shoehorn With Teeth and Why Does The Sun Shine? But what about Ana Ng and Don’t Let’s Start? I guess you can’t fit all their songs into one concert… As with the last time I saw them (almost exactly two years ago to the date!), TMBG is really good live. Some of the Flood songs seemed a bit under-rehearsed, but besides that they were good. Linnell sang a wrong lyric in Letterbox and I think everyone noticed. Also, random thought of the concert: “Is it weird that there is a giant room of people all singing along to a song about buying prosthetic foreheads to wear on their real heads? I guess not.” Also similar to last time, the band left, then came back for two or three songs, then left again. At this point I was really tired and started walking off. But then they did a second encore! That’s how you know they’re professionals. I just hope they don’t push it so much that each song requires an additional encore, starting from the first song played. That would get tiring. The last song they did was Fingertips from Apollo 18, which I think they also did the previous concert I saw. It’s a crowd-pleaser. Hopefully I will get to see They Might Be Giants again some time. They really are fantastic live (especially Linnell’s piercing voice) and really fun, too."

        "content": "Every once in a while a book comes along that seems like it was written specifically for me. Actually, that never happens. But then I heard about How to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide For Asian Men . And that, my friends, is a book with “Hung Truong” written all over it! I first heard about it from my internet pals JP Meyer and Maria via their Google Reader shared feeds. After seeing the cover and reading the title, I knew I had to get this book. I promptly ordered the thing from a third party Amazon seller for whatever crazy high price it was. It was completely worth it. I didn’t get the book to improve my white woman dating skills, but rather to try and get into the mind of an Asian guy who would write such a book (I am already dating a white woman, fairly successfully). The book is written by Adam Quan, who is apparently “an International Business Consultant” who has “successfully dated women of many nationalities.” The book has a little bit of everything, from a theory on why white guys have more luck with Asian girls versus Asian guys and white girls, to detailed statistics on divorce rates and even score sheets for keeping track of your white woman dating progress. I am not making any of this up! One of the best parts of the book is the inclusion of Asian grammars. There are countless grammar and spelling mistakes sprinkled here and there. It helps to read the book in the voice of a grumpy old Asian male. Here’s an example: The image you projected to the white woman is the very core of your dating strategy. To date successfully, often you must become knowledgeable about the white woman in question. Find out what ticks her. Unfortunately (for anyone reading the book seriously), the advice doesn’t really seem all that helpful. The author suggests that to compensate for being tiny, Asian men should work out to increase their physical size. Another section heading is titled “Avoid Losers.” Yet the book sorta forgets to include some common knowledge about dating, like calling the girl the day after a date, etc. The process that the book suggests seems a bit too structured and analytical. I guess it could help to keep a journal, but should Asian men really be keeping track of their current “points,” gain/loss velocity and possible competition after each date!? It’s pretty apparent that a businessman wrote this. Another distressing thing about the book is its fairly misogynistic tone. For one thing, it treats women as objects, often referring to them as “targets” and the reader as a “hunter.” It portrays the submissive Asian woman stereotype and flips that around to conclude that white women are focused on being headstrong individuals. This is not to say that I didn’t find the book to be extremely entertaining. But there were quite a few parts that had me scratching my head and wondering about those who would take it seriously. I kind of feel bad for the Asian guys who need this book and end up taking its advice. Overall, the book is quite useless for its intended purpose. For unintentional humor, this book rates very high. If I weren’t already dating a white woman and wanted to bag one, I think it’d also be great as a prop. Just take this to the nearest Starbucks (or wherever white women gather in your area) and pretend to be studying it closely. It’ll definitely be more useful as a conversation starter than a reference book. My advice: be yourself. Be genuine. Really listen. Oh, and really do work out to compensate for your wimpy Asian physique. Wii Fit seems to work well for me."

        "content": "I got to see Ingrid Michaelson in concert at Neumos in Seattle last night. I previously saw her for the first time in Ann Arbor, 2007 . Unfortunately, I didn’t get to see her in Ann Arbor last year because she sold out pretty quickly. From what I remember of the last time I saw her (I haven’t re-read my other concert post yet), she seemed really modest and was excited that people in the audience knew the words to some of her songs. After two years of success, it seems like she’s a lot more confident, but also kind of diva-ish. Not that she’s a bitch or anything, but she’s sort of less charming in the way she was before. She still mentioned lots of random stuff like crying a bunch after watching The Family Stone on the tour bus and how much they like all like Mexican food. Before Ingrid and the band came on, there was an opening act guy named Matthew Perryman Jones. I wonder if it’s his real name or a fake stage name! He was pretty good, but his songs were kind of yawn-inducing. He was nice though, and he said that all proceeds of the music and shirts and stuff would go to a child in need. Then he revealed the child in need is his child! What a joker. Ingrid and the gang came on kind of late, and started with Soldier, which is the opener of her new album, Everybody , which I haven’t written about yet. Then she played a mix of songs from her past three albums. The first time I saw her, she only brought her friend Allie, but this time she had a full band, which is kind of necessary for playing a lot of the arrangements in the new album. The older songs felt a little weird with a full band though. To be fair, some of the arrangements were refreshing, like Far Away turned into a much richer song and I think Giving Up almost turned into a country song, which had an awesome effect. This is exactly why live performances are worthwhile to plunk down change for. Ingrid said she was tired because she had taken a nap. I can relate. It’s hard to get back on track after taking an hour nap. She sounded fine, though. Her voice was as nice as I remember it. There were times that she used a little too much vibrato though. But she’s totally still got it talent-wise. I think her songwriting has gotten better as well. I really like Die Alone, don’t get me wrong. But it’s just a little too repetitive. Her new songs are much better in that sense. Oh, also, when she sang Can’t Help Falling in Love, some girl fainted. And she said it happened the previous night, too! Maybe it’s an epidemic. Or maybe people just know they can get Ingrid to come to their rescue and get close to her by pretending to faint during that song… Overall, I think Ingrid Michaelson has improved quite a lot. The lacking maturity factor that I wrote about in my previous posts seems to have resolved itself. Maybe is a really good album. And Ingrid is a really good performer (and so are her bandmates, especially Allie). Oh, and her other girl guitar player is kind of cute. So go see her live if she hasn’t already sold out in your town! Apparently she has sold out everywhere she’s gone so far. Hopefully I will get to see Ingrid again some time soon without a skip year like before!"

        "content": "As some of you may know, grocery shopping is very important to me. It’s one of my favorite adult activities to partake in. Which is to say that grocery shopping is one of those things that you do after making the transition from kid to adult. Or at least that’s what I like tricking myself into believing. In Michigan, I went to Meijer , because it pretty much had everything I needed. I’d also make a side trip to Trader Joe’s maybe once a month for hippie supplies. Now, in a new city, I must figure out where to get my foods and stuffs. Meijer is strictly a Midwest chain, unfortunately. Now, the obvious choice would be to pick the closest grocery. It’s pretty easy to calculate the distance to the closest grocery because I live above the PCC Food co-op thingy . Literally. I am on the fifth floor and they take up the first floor in my building. I could literally jump down to the store entrance. Actually, a firefighter pole setup might be safer and cooler, but I’ll have to ask my landlord about it. The PCC is pretty high quality; it makes Trader Joe’s look like Wal-mart. But things there also cost an arm and a leg (good thing I upped my accidental death and dismemberment insurance (AD&amp;D)). So I go there for quick and inexpensive things, like bananas or other produce, or when I really need something bad (like tofu). Also, PCC doesn’t sell anything that’s not “natural,” so I can’t get goldfish crackers or Drain-o there. There is a Trader Joe’s in Ballard that’s pretty nearby that I’m hitting often. I also just discovered a Fred Meyer (I dunno if there’s a relation to Meijer) that has a Chase bank in it (bonus points, just like my old Meijer!). The Fred Meyer is gigantic and pretty close to Wal-mart vibe. I’ve also gone to Safeway for my unnatural foods. When I shop at the University Village, I can hit up the QFC (which is like Kroger/Smith’s) on the way. I haven’t been to Whole Foods yet, but I don’t see a reason to with the Whole Foods-ish PCC taking care of my overpriced grocery needs. There’s also apparently a place in Ballard called Ballard Market (appropriately) that’s supposed to be pretty decent. I’ve also gone to the Asian market, Uwajimaya, in the International District, but that’s more of a specialty case. Also, I don’t eat enough food to shop at Costco ( orange juice excluded from this statement). As you can see, I am a bit obsessive about grocery shopping. I haven’t found a store that has all the stuff I need/want in one location at the price I’d like to pay. So for now I think I’ll forage around multiple stores, which is inconvenient but somewhat necessary. Ever since I read The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I feel like I should be a bit more careful in the purchasing and preparation of my food. I don’t feel too bad spending a chunk of change on something at PCC. Unless, of course, there’s a random markup and I can get the same thing somewhere else for 40% less. Oh, and I just got a hold for In Defense of Food at the library, so hopefully that will make me a bit less picky."

        "content": "I have had some experience with craigslist before, but never selling stuff. I just looked at some apartments. But since I’m moving and I need to get rid of stuff, I listed a few things on craigslist to sell. One girl contacted me about my coffee table almost immediately after I listed it. Her roommate picked it up and he told me she’s kind of a hawk on craigslist. Many people contacted me about stuff and never replied after I replied to them. Some people just didn’t show up. Lots of people are bad about calling before showing up. Actually, no one so far has called before showing up. This is bad, because what if the thing already sold? The most interesting thing about craigslist interactions is that they consist of two parties who don’t really trust each other, except that they recognize they’re both just normal humans who are probably okay. There’s a lot of implicit trust set in. Like, for example, the dude who picked up my table left his wallet in my apartment for some reason. Maybe that’s like a form of escrow. Then he paid me after the entire table was ready to be driven away. The person who took my couch paid me upfront, before I helped her husband move the couch into their truck. Either way is fine, I guess, if you believe that people are inherently trustworthy. Or at least trustworthy enough to not drive away with your table if you go back into your apartment to get him some tape to hold down the drawers. Also, it would be much easier to just steal from people than set up an elaborate craigslist scam. I wonder if anyone has done research on the psychology of craigslist. There’s certainly a lot of risk/reward built into the system, along with not knowing people, whether they’re trustworthy, etc. There’s also just a mad adrenaline rush when you get a wad of money and someone takes your couch for you! I have a few more things to get rid of, so hopefully the rest of my transactions go as well as my previous ones!"

I don’t see any other panel ideas that are too similar to it and I think it’s a neat idea. Basically I’ll get a bunch of student entrepreneurs and have them talk about the challenges and opportunities of doing startups while still in school. I know a few other entrepreneurs and I’m trying to enlist the help of others. Here’s the proposal: Description: While student startups are not a new phenomenon, universities and venture capitalists are beginning to see the advantages in supporting them. Join a panel of student entrepreneurs in a discussion on finding funding, incorporating a company and balancing homework, work and life, all while attending school full-time. Questions answered during the panel: How are universities starting to support student entreprenurship? What are the legal implications of using university resources for personal business? (copyright) How can I “double-dip” schoolwork and startup work into the same project? What kinds of venture capital support are available specifically for student startup businesses? Into which type of corporate structure should a student startup incorporate? How much money do I need to get started as a student entreprenur? How can I get my classmates to provide free labor? What should I look out for when accepting work from non-company students? (ownership rights) How does one achieve a healthy work/homework/life balance as a student entrepreneur? What happens when I (and my partners) graduate? So far, my pal Ben Congleton has said he’ll be on the panel. Now to find a bunch of other panelists! You can also help by voting for my panel (I should have mentioned this first) here !"

For example, they rejected the Google Voice app using their generic “duplicates iPhone features” reasoning. Isn’t that kind of reasoning grounds for an antitrust case? They also rejected a dictionary app for potentially bad words! Someone think of the children! While I think Apple deserves some credit for popularizing the whole app store notion, they also kind of suck for holding such an iron grip on it. It’s nice to find apps in the store without having a third party directory or searching for apps all over the mobile web. But it sucks when honest developers get screwed because of totalitarian control. I wonder if there can’t be a nice, happy medium. Maybe an app store combined with a way to legally (without jailbreaking) install apps via a third party. For now, the iPhone’s App Store is great for customers, but I have a feeling that abused developers will eventually learn their lesson and go elsewhere."

        "content": "I made the switch from PC to Mac a pretty long time ago. It’s been about two years since I started using my first Macbook and a few months since I went exclusively to using OS X (when my PC crapped out). I recently got bored and decided to fix up my PC and put Win 7 RC on it (I think the thing flipped out when I got a new hard drive and it somehow got two Win XPs into the boot registry thing). I already tried installing Win 7 Beta on my Macbook Pro a few times via Boot Camp and VMWare Fusion. They were both pretty bad solutions. It’s just too much to try and virtualize a modern operating system, and the Boot Camp drivers are just kinda crappy. My main thing was that Win 7 kept crashing in Boot Camp, losing wireless connections and having a really laggy touchpad interface. You may recall that my opinions of Vista were not the most positive. About a year and a half (and an operating system) later, I think the thing is finally pretty good. The user experience is nice. I like the fact that I can hit the window key, then type whatever I want and get a list of programs, etc. It’s really useful because the control panel is so insanely organized that it’s impossible to find anything in a hierarchical manner. I guess that’s a mixed complement/critique. I like the desktop backgrounds, and all the apps I’ve installed so far work pretty well. I didn’t have to scavenge for a single driver, which was really nice. When I managed to buy Windows 7 UK and installed it on my mom’s laptop, however, it was quite a task getting the video card to work (it was an old Dell 300m). The only real complaint I have is that file sharing is still really confusing. I found out how to access my shared folders from OS X, but I haven’t figured out how to access my Mac from Win 7. Overall, though, Win 7 is actually looking pretty good. If I actually had a need for this desktop, I might actually use it more often (besides for playing games). For now I’ll stick with my trusty Macbook Pro. I’m thinking the upcoming Snow Leopard upgrade will keep OS X interesting."

        "content": "I just finished reading Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals . While it took some time for me to read through all 411 pages, it was a really enjoyable experience. From my library account page, I can see I renewed the book 5 times! The Omnivore’s Dilemma basically states that there is something really wrong with the way that America is eating. This is probably already very apparent by the amount of obesity, diabetes and eating disorders that we all hear about on the news. But besides the insane portion sizes and amounts of sugar, there’s also something horribly strange about the way our food is produced. Pollan takes a journalistic approach to get to the bottom of the issue, following the trail of corn to his McDonald’s meal, the life of his CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation) steer, a meal cooked on a “sustainable” farm and his own “perfect meal” that was created solely by himself via foraging and hunting. As a vegetarian, I’ve always been pretty picky about my food. After living on my own and making my own decisions on grocery shopping, I tried to further educate myself on what to eat and what not to eat. Typically, I follow some general rules (sugar is better than corn syrup, organic is better than non-organic) but I couldn’t say I knew the reasoning behind them. That’s the way, Pollan argues, that most of America regards food. He finds it funny that people care more about the person fixing their car than the person producing their food. While an automobile’s upkeep is pretty important, isn’t our health just as important? The book is pretty huge, and there’s really no point in me going through it, writing about the whole thing. There are a few things that I really appreciated about it. For one, it confirms my decision not to eat meat. CAFOs are pretty horrible in terms of causing suffering for animals. They’re also really bad for the environment. I also think it’s healthier to abstain from eating hormone-laced animals. From a great number of viewpoints, it makes sense to not eat mass-produced meat. I simply take it a step further and rule out all meat. Pollan argues that animals evolved with humans to be eaten by them. After all, many animals in nature are carnivorous. While I agree with that, I think that on a personal level, I’d rather not have that blood on my hands if I can help it. In that regard, I think I’m lucky to be living in a society where it’s possible to choose to not eat meat and still be healthy. Another interesting idea is that in order to produce the huge amounts of corn needed to make all kinds of food items, farmers need to use synthetic fertilizers. These fertilizers are created using fossil fuels. So in order to grow corn, we’re using oil. It makes me wonder how efficient the ethanol from corn that fuels cars really is. So not only is the corn that we put into our food not necessarily natural and healthy, it’s also depleting our fossil fuels and polluting the environment. It seems so ironic, but I guess that’s what the government wants to spend money subsidizing. I think I’ve already written a lot about this book. Really, it’s a good read and everyone who eats should take a look at it. But you don’t have to take my word for it! [audio:rr.mp3]"

        "content": "Looking back on my old posts from before I went to school at a hybrid Information/Library Science school, my opinions of librarians seemed fueled by a bit of prejudice. For example, in my visiting days post I wrote: I sat down at a table whose occupants were librarians. Pretty much everyone there was an LIS (library and information services) specialist. This wasn’t really a great first impression, since I applied under the HCI (human-computer interaction) specialization, and to be honest, libraries aren’t really my thing. What, exactly, did I have against librarians and libraries? I think I mostly felt that, from the school’s website (or the parts of the website that I studied), the program was more for people who were generally interested in information from a more technology-oriented viewpoint. So I was hoping to see more technological-minded folks at my table. I still, however, decided to enroll. And I’m glad I did. Slowly, I think I started to understand what libraries are all about. I started using the local library . A lot. It probably also helped that I worked at a library my entire time at the school. I wasn’t studying to be a librarian, but I was exposed to the culture. Computer nerds and librarians make a good team. So did library school actually change me? Or was I somehow intrinsically drawn to the program where computer nerds and book nerds collide? Maybe a little of both. I’ve always had a secret love for organizing and archiving things. For example, pretty much no one in my family seems to care much about backing up files. I, on the hand, am a bit obsessed about it. I still have files from middle school preserved in their original file formats and directory structure in place. Who knows, some day I might want to look back on that stuff. I’m also kind of a nut when it comes to properly organizing and applying metadata (and preserving said metadata) from photos. Oh, and also backing everything up, both on-site and off-site (using multiple online services). I also get really irritated when I go to the library and see something like this: Is that a Drama and Horror blu-ray disc I see mixed in with the Action ones!? Usually I will take the offending discs and put them in the right place. There was also that one time I saw Harry Potter in Comedy when it should have gone in Fantasy . The worst is when a DVD gets mixed in with blu-ray. That’s like the same as a book being in the CD section! Oh man, now I’m rambling. The point is, I think I already had some Librarian/Archivist in me before coming to library school. Hanging out with like-minded people probably reinforced the behavior mentioned above. And probably for the better. If you’re a computer nerd, I suggest you check out libraries (and librarians!). If you’re a library nerd, I suggest you check out computer nerd stuff (and computer nerds!). Together, we can make the world a more information-y place."

        "content": "I’ve become kind of a Vitamin Water fan. Not because I think it’s actually healthy or anything (the second most common “vitamin” (ingredient) is sugar), but because I like the taste. I’ve actually been drinking the stuff for like a year now. Anyway, I recently noticed (like a month ago) that there was a new flavor available called “Sync.” The cool thing about this flavor is that it includes a code on the cap that you can redeem at AmazonMP3 (for some reason it says the music comes from MySpace) for a free song. By “a free song,” they really mean $1.29 of credit, since some songs cost that much, but others actually cost less. Because of this added value of this flavor (the other ones don’t have free songs), I’ve been kind of loading up on Sync. This also leads me to a semi-interesting economics problem. If I regularly bought MP3s from Amazon.com, I’d be doing myself a favor by getting $1.29 worth of “music” for ~$1, along with a free sugary, sorta-vitamin-y drink. This price difference was even greater when I went to Kroger and got 10 Vitamins-Water for $5! But I don’t regularly buy music online. If I like an artist and want to support him/her/them, I’ll buy a CD, because then at least I have a physical representation of something that I can “own.” Not just bits. But what about Sync versus other flavors? While I like the other flavors (and variety is good), I’ve kind of been giving Sync an 8:2 split. So for every ten Vitamin Waters I get, about eight of them are Sync. I mean, I like to have some kind of variety! The Sync flavor is actually pretty good, too. It’s probably just about equal with any other Vitamin Water flavor. One positive about the whole free music thing is that I’ve actually bought a lot of music. Here’s what I’ve gotten thanks to glacéau: Ingrid Michaelson – Maybe Warsaw – Rude Girl Jonathan Coulton – Joco Looks Back (Album) Ingrid Michaelson – Turn to Stone Ingrid Michaelson – When the Leaves Ingrid Michaelson – All Love I basically got a bunch of Ingrid Michaelson singles, a ska song I liked that I didn’t have on my computer and a Jonathan Coulton “best of” album. All artists who I like and want to support. I mean, Jonathan Coulton kinda offers all of his music free anyway, so I saw this AmazonMP3 thing as a good way to send him some money (I also went to one of his concerts , which I assume helped support him (or maybe TicketMaster just pocketed it all!!!)). Sadly, my free ride is nearing its end. The last time I went to Kroger, I bought some more Sync. When I got home and drank one, I realized the caps had changed. No more free songs! The wording on the bottle even changed to reflect the fact that there’s no song in there. I assumed the flavor would have free songs forever, but apparently not. I’ll keep an eye out for the bottles with songs, but I fear they will eventually dry out. Pun intended. The last economics question for this blog post: If Vitamin Water presents an extra incentive with the drink, then removes that incentive later, does it hurt its sales? I used to buy the drink because I liked it. I may have replaced the reason for buying it with free songs. Now that there are no more free songs, will I continue to buy? Or will I feel robbed because I am now paying the same amount for less?"

        "content": "I recently got a new iPhone 3GS (32GB!) and with it a new phone number. I’ve had a Google Voice number from way back when it was called GrandCentral . I never used it because I found the integration a bit lacking. As I now must inform people of my new number, I was thinking about giving them the Google Voice one instead of the “real” one. This is also as Google Voice is getting considerable buzz since it’s finally giving away invites after closing off the service quite some time ago. Here are some pros and cons to either choice. Pros : I don’t have to ever tell people I’m changing my phone number again in the future. Neat voicemail transcripting. Routing calls from phone to phone (I might want it to go to my work phone at certain times, mobile at other times) Googliness? Cons : The voicemail system won’t be integrated into my iPhone There isn’t an official iPhone app for Google Voice yet. SMS doesn’t work with short codes (40404 for Twitter) Calls made through voice won’t count as “mobile-to-mobile.” Other integration issues. Possible dependency issues. For me, Google Voice is pretty cool, but not cool enough to rely on because of its crappy integration. By crappy integration, I mean that Google Voice just simply cannot expect to integrate itself well into other companies’ phone systems. There are a number of examples of this. One is that if I want to send a text to someone, I need to use Google Voice to do it instead of my phone. This adds a layer of obfuscation to the process. Here’s what the help doc on Google Voice says: Call, Voicemail and SMS Issues: Receiving SMS on phone from 406 numbers When you send an SMS through Google Voice, the SMS appears to be sent from your Google number. When someone sends an SMS to your Google number, and it’s forwarded to your mobile phone, it won’t appear as from the sender’s actual number (e.g., the SMS may appear from 1-406-xxx-xxxx). This is so that when you reply to the 1-406-xxx-xxxx number from your phone, the SMS you send appears to be sent from your Google number and will be saved in your Google Voice inbox. Holy crap, that’s just confusing! Another example of Google Voice not playing well with existing companies’ systems would be mobile-to-mobile calls. If I call my sister using Google Voice, the call probably won’t count as “free” since it’s going to Google instead of directly to her phone number. Though apparently if you add the Google Voice number to T-Mobile’s “Faves” you could get some pretty interesting free call results… Another peeve I have about Google Voice is that they’ve decided to make the mobile apps for Blackberry and Android thus far. I wonder if this is because the iPhone is a competitor to their own Android platform or if they just decided it would be easier, or for any other reason. It kind of shows a “ Microsoft Moment ” for lack of better term for Google; writing software to serve their own ends versus writing software to reach their customers on the platform they use. I don’t have any numbers to back this up though (are there more Android+Blackberry users than iPhone?), so at this point I’m just complaining because I have an iPhone and it doesn’t have an app. For now I will ditch Google Voice (or just not use it) until it can be integrated effortlessly into my own mobile phone’s system. The whole point of using Google Voice is to simplify things. I can see it’ll be a really complicated road ahead for Google to actually implement this, but I hope they do. It almost surely means they’ll need to work with phone companies directly. This will probably take time and lots of money. I’ll just stick with my own phone’s capabilities until then."

One of these things is riding a Segway around the historic battlegrounds. I guess that counts as enjoying history as well… Emily, Katie and I set up an appointment at SegTours of Gettysburg for a “Segway Experience.” This did not include an actual tour. While we were getting ready for basic training, the lady asked us if we’d mind going on the real tour (she claimed she wanted to get more practice doing the tour). We were really happy to get a free upgrade since the reason for choosing the “experience” was to lessen the burden on our pocketbooks. Basic training consists of Segwaying around in a parking lot until you get the hang of it. There are also cones involved. I got going pretty quickly. It probably has to do with the fact that I do Wii Fit a lot and thus am quite aware of my balance most of the time. The Segway accelerates backward and forward based on how much weight you put forward or backward. Staying stationary is kind of a challenge as you must keep your balance completely in the center. The video above is of basic training. There was an older couple who also did the training but didn’t feel confident enough to go on the tour. They were nice though; the older gentleman was smoking a pipe on his Segway. The actual tour had us going through the Eastern battlefield. I must say, it was really fun going through alleyways and roads on the way to the actual battlefield. We also went through a hotel parking lot and passed a swimming pool. It’s really fun just effortlessly accelerating around while everyone else needs to walk up a hill. While the others complained about the Segway being a lot of work to ride, I thought it was pretty decent; just like standing. What did I learn on my tour? That I want a Segway. I should really just get something more reasonable like a bike (which I think would provide the same kind of exhilaration, but with pedaling). Segway-riding is really fun and I hope to do it again some time. Oh, and history is also good, I guess."

        "content": "What the hey!? Michael Jackson died today (yesterday)! Well that’s kind of a bummer. I mostly spent most of the evening listening to his music (I went to the library and grabbed History) and watching music videos on YouTube. Also, I just remembered about the random Super Mario Bros. sprite animations that some Japanese person (sikamako) made using graphics from the old Genesis game, Moonwalker ! I had only previously linked to one. So I thought that in tribute of MJ, I’d link to all of them. They’re all really weird: Super Michael Bros. I think this is the original one. I don’t remember where I got it. Seems sort of normal enough. Just MJ running through a few Mario stages. Michael Quest Michael Quest is a little weirder. Basically he comes in and pwns a bunch of video games. Then some red ninjas come in? Then MJ is revived by Luigi? And he turns into the metal thing from Moonwalker. Yeah, this really makes no sense. Just watch it. Michael Fantasy It actually gets weirder. There’s a flashback to Michael Quest (of course). Then the princess rides a gigantic Zangief from SFII to destroy the earth. This is foreshadowed before it actually happens, so then a bunch of random video game characters try and stop it. And of course, Michael Jackson saves the day again. Michael Forever I believe this is the last one. I think Michael finds some Dragon Balls, revives some characters, then has to stop Princess Peach again, this time riding a giant E. Honda… There’s a lot of Japanese pop cultural references (like Doraemon, Dragon Ball, etc) and I probably don’t understand all of them. Suffice it to say that MJ is still a badass in this one. Crisis averted."

        "url": "/blog/2009/06/23/blade-runner-blu-ray-edition-review/",
        "content": "I haven’t ever watched Blade Runner , and since I saw it on Blu-Ray at the library I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to catch up and earn some geek cred. The movie seems to have all the ingredients necessary for sci-fi cult success: Harrison Ford, matte painting backgrounds, robots, Harrison Ford. But something kinda went wrong. Spoiler alert from here on out! Blade Runner takes place in a future where androids are kind of indistinguishable from normal humans. But they rebelled against us and now we want to kill them all. This makes them want to kill us. Man, things get complicated quickly. People who hunt down androids are called “Blade Runners.” Harrison Ford is a blade runner. There are some androids (actually they’re called replicants) that Harrison Ford needs to kill. This movie has a really simple plot. Blade Runner is apparently supposed to be really good. The Blu-Ray version has like, five versions of the movie. Either this means that the movie was so good that it was worthy of having five versions, or it sucked so bad that they needed to fix it multiple times! I am thinking the latter. The issue is that Harrison Ford’s character is supposed to be a badass blade runner who retired to get out of the game. But really, he’s just lousy cop with incredible luck. Blade Runner is like an exercise in how to perform Deus Ex Machina bailouts, one after another. Example 1: Harrison Ford (his movie name is “Decker” but let’s just call him HF) is trying to trick one of the replicants in her dressing room. She figures out he’s a cop and starts choking him. She obviously has the upper hand. But then some girls walk into the dressing room so she splits and then somehow Harrison catches up to her and guns her down. Very sporting. Example 2: One of the replicants sees Harrison killing replicant 1. He obviously has an advantage. He sneaks up on Harrison and starts kicking his ass. He’s also about to deliver a final blow and the other “good” replicant saves his life by shooting the bad guy in the head. Example 3: Harrison lets the replicant catch him by surprise and she jumps on his head, twists it 180 degrees backwards. For some reason she lets him go so she can do some kind of backflip finishing move. She really should’ve just snapped his neck or something. Harrison has a chance to get up and shoots her in mid backflip. This also seems unsportsmanlike. Example 4: The replicant boss guy kind of plays around with Harrison, breaking his fingers and chasing him around. But eventually gives up since he’s (the replicant) gonna die anyway. Harrison lives to see another day. So really, Decker just lucked out every single time. It makes sense; how is a human supposed to beat a super-strong replicant? Decker’s only real skill is that he’s incredibly lucky. This sort of puts him in the same league as other HF characters like Han Solo (remember when he chases that stormtrooper into a room with a billion stormtroopers?) or Indiana Jones. But the movie portrays him as some kind of a Dirty Harry or Rambo-esque killing machine. He’s more like Mister Magoo or Maxwell Smart. But somehow I don’t think that connection was intended by the filmmaker. Besides the whole plot thing, some critics apparently had problems with the pacing. I thought it was okay, except there are long stretches of Decker stuff, then long stretches of replicant team stuff. As if there were two separate plots and movies going on. I mean, it seemed like they showed two days’ worth of Decker action then two days’ worth of the other guys, but they happened around the same time span. So there’s some weirdness in continuity. The plot also seems to only lightly address the heavy plot points. For example, the moral implications of giving life to these replicants and then limiting their lifespan. That’s in addition to basically making them illegal and then killing them. Instead the movie tends to antagonize them even though they’re really the victims in this story. It turns into a simple cat and mouse hunt rather than anything particularly meaningful. One thing the filmmaker got right: The future sure has a lot of Asians in it! Japanese, Chinese, etc. I sure am glad we’re represented (though also sort of tokenized) in the future! I really have no idea why this movie is considered a classic. Maybe I’m being too hard on it. It was, after all, released in ‘82, before I was born. But plenty of sci-fi movies made before then stand the test of time. I feel as though Blade Runner is just a bit overrated. Just to give Philip K. Dick a chance, I grabbed “ Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? ” from the library. I think it may end up being a more thoughtful exercise."

        "content": "I cook sometimes. It’s pretty fun and my food actually turns out pretty delicious sometimes. Today I made a new dish which I will call “PoBroccoFu Delight.” It’s the second time I used potatoes in a stir fry environment and the first time I successfully did so. I figured I’d write down the recipe so I can remember what the heck I did. Ingredients: 1 medium-sized potato 1 pack of broccoli (there were three stalks in it) 1 tofu carton, firm some random onions a little bit of garlic salt some chopped garlic (from a thing of garlic lover’s hummus that was too garlicky) some “flavoring” that my mom gave me some “vegetarian stir-fry” sauce The first thing I did was cut the tofu into ~1cm thick slices and fry it. While this was happening I also washed the potato and then chopped it into bite-sized pieces. It’s good to parallelize your cooking because it makes the process go much faster. Just don’t forget to start the rice cooking like I did or else you’ll have to wait on it to finish before eating. I didn’t peel the potato because the skin tastes kinda good and it has a nice texture. The reason I wanted to use potato is because I had it previously at No Thai! (which is unfortunately not vegetarian) and I like the potato in stir fry motif. After the tofu was done frying, I set it aside and threw some more oil and the chopped potatoes in. The oil kinda flew around a lot, which I do not like. It got the kitchen floor all oily and slippery. Anyway, I left the potatoes in there to fry a bit and turned them occasionally. Then I got to work cutting the broccoli into just the head parts (florets?). The potatoes need more time to get cooked, so it’s a good idea to cook them first. I didn’t realize this the last time I used potatoes and got fairly uncooked potatoes in my stir fry. Gross. The time it took to cut the broccoli was just about enough to let the potatoes cook. I also chopped some of the tofu (about half of it; I kept the other slices for maybe fried rice later or a quesadilla) as well. I put some garlic salt on the potatoes and then remembered that I had a bunch of garlic from a package of Garlic Lover’s Hummus that I spooned out of the hummus. Too much garlic is gross. I had it set aside and I figured I’d just throw it in (garlic is good). Then I threw the broccoli and tofu in. I also added some of the random flavoring seasoning stuff my mom gave me a while back (I always joke that it’s MSG, but I think it’s really some kind of mushroom-based flavoring). I also used the rest of the “Vegetarian Stir Fry Sauce” that I got from the Asian grocery. I just realized this post is really unscientific. Oh well; it still turned out well. I added some onions (because really, why not?) and then added some sesame oil in addition to the other olive oil that I always use for cooking. I stirred the contents around for a while (hence, stir fry). I was a bit worried it would be too “dry” but it turned out fine. I would’ve probably added some water or more of that stir fry sauce but I ran out. I figured it’d be okay. The broccoli has a really nice natural flavor when it’s cooked, and the potatoes add a nice texture when they’re fried. They also absorb a lot of flavor. The tofu also absorbs lots of flavor and works as the protein of the dish. I think that’s about it. Despite the fact that I didn’t put a whole lot of effort or thought into the meal, it tasted really good! Hopefully I can make it again and reproduce the results:"

        "content": "I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction books lately. A lot has been written about Malcolm Gladwell’s books so I figured I’d grab a bunch from the library. I just finished reading “ blink .” I haven’t read The Tipping Point or Outliers just yet. Anyway, I thought I’d write a quick review. Blink tells the story of our subconscious (Gladwell uses “unconscious” which kinda bugs me) brain’s ability to make split-second decisions. Basically, he argues that we’ve evolved to “thin-slice” certain experiences (recognizing when a fake statue just doesn’t look right or hearing a singer who turns out to be a natural). That ability can be used in other contexts if we could just determine the important variables and block out everything else. Gladwell is a really good writer; his stories are interesting and they flow well. Unfortunately, the actual substance feels like it lacks the scientific rigor that I’m used to. For example, he has a chapter on the aforementioned thin-slicing – only taking in the important elements of a situation and deciding based on those. Later, he discounts thin-slicing because it leads to us stereotyping entire ethnicities and cultures. He gives an example where music executives hear a singer who they know is a natural hit (and cites Fred Durst as an expert, which makes me throw up in my mouth a little). Unfortunately the executives fail when it turns out that actual listeners don’t like the artist. Another story is about a wargame that the army set up where the advanced system succumbed to paralysis by analysis. It was a really weak example of thin-slicing and had very little to do with the theory he described earlier. I think he just wrote that chapter to fill up the book. The book is full of inconsistencies and it seems like Gladwell is trying to tie everything into a cohesive theory. The thing is he fails at it pretty horribly. What we end up with is a bunch of nice stories and no overarching theory of anything. They’re just stories. Are they interesting? Yeah, but they contradict each other and end up making the book weaker in its narrative. As a counter-example, Duncan Watts has a way of writing interesting stories and linking them all together in Six Degress (how appropriate). Also fun to note is that I believe there’s some kind of nerd feud going on between Watts and Gladwell . I tend to believe Duncan Watts because he’s a super badass and has numbers to back up his theories. I dunno if I’ll read any additional Gladwell books at this point. I’ll probably try some other authors first and go back if I run out of other stuff to read."

        "content": "Yesterday was my birthday. I’ve been aware of this giant list of free stuff to get in Ann Arbor on your birthday at ArborWiki, and since my last day of work was on Friday and I’m basically on vacation, I figured I’d try and get as much free stuff as possible. This is my story. The day started pretty late. I was up kind of late the night before writing my post on the Quarterlife Crisis and then set the post to show up at like 9:30am. But I slept in until around 10:30 and didn’t get out of the house until after noon. I had to print out coupons and basically plan out my day. The first stop was Northside Grill . They offer a free entree until 3pm. For free! I went by myself since everyone else was working. I saw this in front of my parking spot: Maybe I’m the only one who finds the sentence “DO NOT READ” to be slightly funny-ironic. Anyway, I went in and got some tasty potato pancakes. If you go to Northside Grill, I highly recommend them! I also got some coffee. While paying, the person behind me overheard that it was my birthday and suggested I go to Cupcake Station to get a free cupcake. After Northside I went to Zingerman’s Deli to get 6 free bagels. I went in and told the girl at the counter that it was my birthday. She told me to just grab the bagels and bring them to her. At first I put the bagels into really small paper bags. I think they could only hold like 3 bagels. So I got two small bags. The girl thought this was dumb and got me a bigger paper bag. Then she didn’t even check my ID! I really wanted to prove it was my birthday to her though, so I showed it to her anyway. I was hoping this could turn into a good craigslist missed connection (you didn’t want to see my ID, I showed it to you anyway. I’ll share some of those free bagels with you for breakfast!). After Zingerman’s I felt like I needed to recharge. So I went home and drafted an email for a Birthday Dinner Extravaganza. Then I chatted up my good friend KDT who happens to be on vacation as well. I picked her up and we went to Caribou Coffee for a free coffee drink (requires you to get on the email list prior). I walked in and asked the dude what the best drink they have is. He didn’t even blink and said it was the Turtle Mocha . I decided to get that. He kept pushing me to add more and more espresso shots. 1? 2? 3!? Every time he hit the extra shot button, the register read “Moose it!” I guess that’s their code for extra shots. Luckily KDT helped me drink the beast or else I probably would’ve been completely moosed. From Caribou we went to the other Zingerman’s, Bakehouse and Creamery, for more free stuff. The Creamery had lots of good gelato, of which I sampled each one before deciding on Mint Chocolate. KDT also tried a bunch. The guy gave us a huge lecture on the difference between gelato and ice cream. Thanks, guy! I also got 6 more bagels at the Bakehouse. Sorry if this is not kosher, Zingerman’s! After eating the gelato (remember, I had samples), I felt kinda gross. Too much heavy free food. We walked around the campus for a while with a prospective student at SI and then went to Pizza House . I got a free Carrot Cake! I couldn’t eat most of it though. So I shared it with the 6 other people there. After Pizza House, we passed the Cupcake Station for a free cupcake. I thought I could just get a free one but they made me buy one, get one free. I didn’t wanna just say “nah, I’m too cheap to purchase one cupcake” so I begrudgingly got one for me and one for KDT. Hers was a “Red Wings” cupcake. I got a chocolate-filled one. I met up with 9 of my friends at Grizzly Peak for dinner. I got a GP pint glass, a $10 gift certificate and a free dessert (cherry cheesecake), but I had to buy dinner. I have to use the gift certificate within a month. I totally forgot to take any pictures at this point. People weren’t ready to call it a night at that point, so we walked through the rain to get to Stucchi’s . Like, massive rain storm. I must’ve been hit by at least 400 individual raindrops. When we got there, I really couldn’t stomach the extra ice cream, so I got a scoop on behalf of my friends (buy one get one free). This picture is sort of staged; I ate like, a spoonful of it: Afterwards I met back up with KDT and had a cupcake candle ceremony and her co-op friends sang me Happy Birthday. It was an unlicensed performance , but I think it’s okay because it was a private performance. Overall it was a fun birthday filled with free stuff and good company. I hope next year’s is just as fun!"

One thing I really like about Firefox (at least these beta versions) is that they support multitouch gestures on my Macbook Pro. Pinching zooms out, un-pinching (spreading?) zooms in, three finger swipe up goes to the top of the page and three finger swipe down goes to the bottom. This is really cool. One of the weirder ones is that twisting with two fingers lets you go back and forth between tabs. I thought it was wacky at first but now I think it’s very useful. For some reason, the default value for this gesture is disabled in the newest version (beta 99). It’s also disabled in Shiretoko, the nightly build. I tried looking in the preferences to control this but they weren’t in there. Then I remembered about:config. To get the twist thing back, type “about:config” into the address bar. Then find the settings that say “browser.gesture.twist” The setting for “browser.gesture.twist.left” should be “Browser:PrevTab”Â  and the one for .right should be “Browser:NextTab” like so: Voila! Your twisty tab changing gestures will be back!"

        "content": "Today, I turn 26. I think I can officially have a “quarterlife crisis.” Yes, I know that’s pretty generous, assuming I’ll live to 104, but hey, with science and technology, maybe life expectancies will shoot up… Though I used the term previously, I recently read about it at Krunk4Ever . That led me to an article about the phenomenon , which led me to a book on the subject . I checked the book out from the library (Shapiro Undergraduate, AKA the UGLi) and figured it’d be an interesting read. Basically, the phenomenon is that people these days are on a fixed track for much of their lives, up til around their twenties. They go to grade school, do well in that, go to college, do well, and maybe go to grad school. After getting a terminal degree, they actually have choices to make. They need to decide what they’ll do for the rest of their lives. This can seem daunting, apparently. I suppose I myself feel that way, though mostly I think it’s empowering and exciting. The article I read was concise and informative. The book is a bit too long, too colloquial and seems to talk down to the reader a bunch. There’s also lots of random references, like a testimonial that uses Back to the Future to drive home the point about rejection (Marty’s dad is a wuss). Basically, the book is composed of a bunch of examples of people who had quarterlife crises and what they did to get out of them. Here’s one of my favorite excerpts (of the amount I read (I only got about halfway through the book before deciding it’s a waste of my reading time)): … I realized that I don’t want to make marriage my goal, because I’m afraid that if marriage is a goal for me, then I’ll settle for some less-than-perfect man when I hit 30 just because the time is right… I have a backup plan: if I’m not married by 30, I’ll buy a cat (I already have two). And then if I’m still single at 35, I’ll buy another cat. And then, if I’m still single at 40, I’ll buy another cat, which means my goal in life is this: at the age of 40, I’ll either be married or have five cats. I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess that Sandra has an ALA-accredited degree … Librarian! Maybe one thing that just annoys me about the book is it’s full of whiny twentysomethings complaining about their lives that aren’t really that bad. Everyone wants a job that’s fulfilling and interesting. But those don’t come easily; if they did, everyone would have them. The book claims the profiles are from multiple ethnicities and regions of the US, but it reads like Stuff White People Like . This is kind of amazing because the book came out years before the blog. I guess my own experience has been a bit different. For a while I didn’t know what I’d end up doing, but I was pretty confident I’d be okay in the end. I just realize that as bad as things might seem, they could definitely be worse. I’ve also been extremely lucky, getting into a great graduate school program, securing a job before graduation, etc, so maybe I have enough direction that this crisis doesn’t apply. I’ve had a few life experiences that have shown me that living life to the fullest is really important. There isn’t really time to doubt yourself and get into a slump. After all, the quarterlife crisis assumes you will live to 100. It assumes that you will have much more life ahead of you. While that may be true, I’ve seen firsthand that life can be cut very short. I think the trick is living with intention and enjoying life howevér you can. Roll with the punches; play it by ear. This doesn’t mean to forgo planning, but don’t sacrifice too much for the distant (unpredictable) future. It sounds cliché, but really, I think it’s a good motto to have. Some people are not even lucky enough to reach their quarterlife crisis. That seems to make the “crisis” seem a bit more manageable. While this is a pretty far-out comparison (being unsure of your life is better than being dead), I think it helps to put the thing into perspective. Be sure to check back in ~25 years for my mid-life crisis thoughts!"

        "content": "I’ve been messing around with iTunes and the DJ functionality. It seems like all it does is pick random songs out of the library and shows them in the order they’ll be played (unlike shuffle, which just randomly jumps around). Typically, I like to put my iTunes library on random when I’m listening. This allows me to hear a bunch of different music in my library. If I don’t like a certain song, I’ll skip it, unless I’m not really paying attention. I find that the most important piece of metadata in my iTunes library is probably “play count.” This is a pretty good indicator of how much I like a song. It’s a bit off sometimes though, since I might really like a new song with a lower play count because I haven’t had a chance to listen to it 80 times. I use a smart playlist that sorts on “play count” to determine which songs to stick into my iPhone on sync since the phone can’t hold my entire music library. Generally it works well. Perhaps there could be another measure like “normalized play count” that takes into account how long the song has existed in my library. The iTunes DJ is pretty lacking in terms of how you can weigh what will randomly show up next. You can basically click a box that says “play higher rated songs more often.” I don’t rate my songs (the metadata gets thrown away pretty quickly as I move from computer to computer or Mac to PC, etc), so this feature doesn’t do a lot for me. I prefer the implicit rating (play count) versus the explicit rating (star rating) because the implicit way to do it is natural and doesn’t require me to do anything extra. I’d like there to be a “play songs with a higher play count more often” feature. This could be bad, though, because it’d lead to a sort of rich get richer deal. So weighting would be important. I’d say it’d be a good heuristic to give each song a probability of “(playcount + 1)/(total number of library plays + # of songs)” to be played. That way the more popular songs (the ones I like more) are played more often, but other songs still have a chance to be played as well (and skipped). There might be other better algorithms for weighing songs based on play count that don’t lead to an unnatural skew (which would mess up the point of having the feature in the first place). Another thing I could do is prune all of the songs I skip most out of my library. I’m too much of a digital packrat to do that, though, so I guess a smarter algorithm will have to suffice."

        "content": "So today, Microsoft unleashed its new search engine, Bing . Apparently it was gonna be called “Kumo” before that (which I liked more). Live.com just redirects to Bing now. First thought: Thanks for wasting the four letter URL namespace, Microsoft! Second thought: Bing.com basically looks like a re-named Live Search. People were talking about the mouse-over video search results starting automagically. I thought I saw that feature at the Microsoft booth at SXSW a few months ago. While I’m not totally familiar with the original features of Live Search, it really seems like this is just an incremental update, if not just a renaming. Giving the search engine a fair chance, I guess it’s okay. The search results for my name are good! First one is my blog and the second one is my portfolio. Microsoft also recognizes my Facebook profile as the real Hung Truong instead of that other car Hung Truong that Google links to. Another thing that’s kind of nice is that Bing actually links to the website directly in the search results. Try right click copying a search result link in Google and you get something like this: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hung-truong.com%2F&amp;ei=1ZMkSv3gDonUNNfQvYYF&amp;rct=j&amp;q=hung+truong&amp;usg=AFQjCNGifmoNxXdlqaiytpE2QMgHxLkl6A&amp;sig2=Uj7WesESTLWJEXHkfqK2Fw The same thing in Bing is just: http://hung-truong.com/ One more funny thing is that Bing is soooooo biased towards Microsoft, and you can tell already. Type the letter ‘w’ into Bing and the 7th auto-suggestion is “Windows Vista.” Google comes up with nothing MS related. The now famous example is that if you type “linux” you’ll get linux windows linux microsoft linux vista WTF!? Despite the wonkiness, I hope Bing does well. Because someone ’s gotta kick Google’s ass for the sake of competition. While I’d rather see it from an independent player, someone’s really gotta step up search and make it better. Actually, Yahoo is doing some neat stuff with semantic web thingies. Maybe MS and Yahoo can double-team Google or something."

This is funny (probably only to me) because it makes me think there might be three levels: Custom Search, Customer Search and Customest Search. Maybe there’s also a Customestest Search available after that."

        "content": "I had a dream that I was in prison for some reason. I guess the reason is irrelevant. I imagine I was innocent and was unfairly accused of committing some crime. Anyway, since weapons are not allowed in prison I decided I would carry a pack of playing cards around and I’d the use cards as some kind of shiv if I got into a tussle. I think the idea originates from when I read about a book (I think this was in some kind of magician’s manual) that explained it was possible to get so proficient at throwing cards that one could, if thrown with enough velocity, lodge a playing card into a watermelon. I’m not sure if this is even really possible. I should look it up or ask it as a reference question to a librarian. Okay, after a brief digression, I found the book: Cards as Weapons . But apparently it’s just a hoax/parody. Oh well. Anyway, back to the dream. As expected (think about Chekhov’s gun ), I eventually got into a major prison fight using cards (my opponent also used cards to fight back). We actually fought with two cards in each hand, sort of knife style or something. The prison guard broke up the fight and had to punish us. This is where the story gets interesting. He used the face value of our cards to determine how severely to punish us! I have to hand it to my dream guard, he sure knows how to make things interesting. Is that just me complementing my own subconscious? I don’t know. The guard was gonna add up the value of the cards we used as weapons and probably put us in “ the box ” for a duration of time appropriate to the value of the hand. Or something. In the middle of the guard figuring out the value, I woke up. Good timing, I think."

        "content": "A while back I wrote a post about rejection and how I dealt with it. I also mentioned a book that I had on hold at the library that seemed kinda related. I got the book and read about half of it. Then I got really busy and had to return the book. After putting it on hold again and getting it back I finished it. So here’s my thoughts (I’m totally a completist so I really have to read the ENTIRE book before I count it as finished). Mindset: The New Psychology of Success , has a really simple message behind it. Depending on your perspective, or “mindset” on life, you can really affect your own learning and personal growth. Basically, people with a “fixed” mindset believe that a person’s qualities are predetermined and set in stone. So people who are good at math won’t fail and those who are bad at math will never be good at it. Conversely, people with a “growth” mindset will understand that with practice and reflection, people can improve in just about any measurable quality. They see failure as a challenge and thrive on improving themselves rather than proving their superiority. (quick anime example: Rock Lee is totally growth and Sasuke is totally fixed) I suppose I’ve been trying hard to adapt to the growth mindset, even before reading this book (see this post for more on that). Previously I think I probably did have a sort of fixed mindset in that I felt I was pretty smart and got through all of high school fairly easily. In college I stumbled a little bit because Computer Science forced me to think in ways I wasn’t used to thinking. I came into an intro course that had hundreds of students of which, by the end, only a fraction remained. I made friends with a guy who had programmed all his life. Another one of my friends had never programmed before. The experienced guy did well on talent, my other friend dropped saying it was too hard and I had to work really hard to keep up. Though at the time I felt a bit inferior to everyone else because I actually had to study hard and struggle, looking back I’m really proud of what I accomplished. Computer Science courses basically taught me that with hard work, I could understand really complicated problems and work out solutions. As for the book itself, It’s very easy to read. In fact, I think it might be a little too easy to read. I think I spent too much time in the past two years reading nothing but academic papers. While I appreciate the colloquial language of the book, it feels sometimes like I’m being written down to. Also, some of the examples and suggestions seem really cheesy, for lack of a better word. Example: If your child displays a fixed mindset, turn dinner into a conversation on how each family member learned something. Soon the kid will be policing you and making sure you show a growth mindset! Sounds like a scene from Family Circus (not the Nietzsche version ). I’d also have to say that the first few chapters really contain the meat of the book. They explain the two mindsets, give examples of each in action and spell out how each one affects a person’s outlook on learning and growth. After the third chapter or so, the book just goes into examples of the mindsets in different contexts: sports, business, relationships, parenting. A good deal of these chapters feels really redundant and a little boring, honestly. I guess they’re useful in reinforcing the ideas, but not completely necessary if you actually read the first three chapters. The last chapter is a workshop of sorts for changing your own mindset. I’d say it’s worth a read as well. Overall, I think the book is an interesting read and the concepts it introduces have a lot of potential. I wouldn’t label the book as self-help; it’s more of a psychology book that you can actually apply in your own life (sort of like Stumbling on Happiness ). At the very least, it’s made me more perceptive of how I react to situations as well as how others around me react."

        "content": "So today is the very near anniversary of me starting Wii Fit. My first day was actually May 23rd 2008, but I think If I wait to post something I might forget to do it in two days. So here’s my anniversary post. It’s actually kind of interesting that for the last few sessions I’ve been feeling pretty tired. Today I felt really energized though. I have no idea why. I was sick the past few days but today I feel pretty much at 100%. Maybe it’s because I got a lot of sleep while sick. I also had a Twig and Berry salad from Zingerman’s today for lunch. Anyway, when I started Wii Fit about a year ago I was obese (according to the machine) and weighed about 202 pounds or so. Today the Wii Fit declared I am merely overweight and that I weigh about 179.9. So within a year I lost 20 pounds. I actually lost the 20 pounds between May and November, I wanna say. Then between November and now, I think I hit some kind of ceiling (or floor). I’ve sort of slowly been losing again. I think it might be a seasonal thing. Besides the lost poundage, I’ve been consistently feeling better (physically) ever since I started, and have been getting better and better. I’m also considering  using a cutting stack just to get those last few pounds off. These days I can walk to and back from campus very easily when a year ago it’d feel like a hike (it’s a little over a mile each way, I think). I believe my general endurance and energy levels have been better, too. I haven’t only been doing Wii Fit to get healthier though. I’ve also been trying to eat better and live more healthily in general. No more soda (pop) for me. I’m pretty happy with my progress with Wii Fit so far. I wish I had done better between the November-Now time points, though I will admit that I made non-pound progress (I am now doing 20 push-ups instead of 10 and lunges are doable when before they were insanely hard). Hopefully I’ll be able to report back in a year with even better numbers and results. Bonus actual anniversary update: (5/23/09) I look at my time completed in Wii Fit and it appears that I did 83 hours and 33 minutes of working out. Not too bad. I know I did less in the beginning and have been ramping up to about 34-45 minutes of workout each session though I don’t do it every day. I’ll probably have more time to commit to working out over this summer though."

I liked the chapters and eventually subscribed to the Freakonomics blog (which sadly only has excerpted stories in its RSS feed). It’s been kind of overdue for me to finish reading the book. I finally checked it out from the library last month and finally had enough time (sick time) to finish it today. There have been a lot of reviews on this book, so I don’t think I need to go there. I’d rather just give my reactions to it. Basically, after reading the book, and assuming the work that’s done in the book is in the realm of economics, I’d really like to become an economist. Seriously. Do economists just sit around at universities all day and think about interesting answers to difficult questions? I’m sure not all of them do. Maybe just a select few who are able to look at the world differently. Maybe it’s a stretch to try and relate my own field of study to the book’s. Maybe not. In my former (I just graduated!) program, a lot of importance was given to contextual inquiry, incentive-centered design, user-centered design, etc. Basically, you can understand a problem better if you understand the context and the people who are experiencing it. I’m actually surprised that there wasn’t formal game theory introduced into the book, though they did touch on that with the example of how a real estate agent’s time would be much better spent trying to get rid of a house than work a little harder for a much smaller commission (volume versus quality). I think that one of the overarching ideas of the book is that incentives drive the behavior of people. People cheat because it benefits them and they can get away with it. They don’t always do what’s best for them, though they might do what seems best given their situation. The world is much more complicated than a few variables in a regression analysis (though it’s still a pretty useful tool!). Also, correlation does not imply causation . The book takes a strictly practical approach (“if morality represents an ideal world, then economics represents the actual world”), which is nice, if you can handle having some of your underlying beliefs questioned. In fact, I think the main thing I learned from the book is to really question “common knowledge” and “popular opinion,” because it almost always seems to be informed more than just fact. I like that this book takes research (and a number of research methods like statistical analysis and surveys) and explains them in a intelligent and easy to understand way. It’s probably why my professor used it as part of the class readings (or maybe she just likes the book). It makes me yet again wish I had still applied for some PhD programs (though whenever I do, I again remember how crappy applying to grad school is and they sorta cancel out). I wonder if this book will have the effect that in twenty years or so, people who read this book and encouraged their kids to become economists will cause a huge uptick in economics degrees…"

        "content": "I attended a sorta all day symposium last Friday at the University of Michigan titled “ Bookishness: The New Fate of Reading in the Digital Age .” While a lot went over my head (I am not as prolific a reader as many of the presenters), I think I still got some cool ideas from it. Leah Price spoke about book fetishism. How, as the book is considered less and less the de facto vehicle by which its contents are delivered, it becomes more of a fetishized object than just a “book.” In other words, there are computer screens, Kindles , audio books and other ways for us to digest fiction and non-fiction works. Because of this, books become special objects. The act of reading a book instead of a screen or anything else becomes something special and deliberate. I tend to agree a lot. Just as part of me enjoys wearing glasses because many people do not, and the act of wearing glasses sort of differentiates me from other people, so does reading a physical book. On top of the fact that leisure reading of books seems to denote socioeconomic status (and the kind of company you keep), I guess I also just like reading. Besides, I don’t have a TV, so what else am I supposed to do with my free time? Paul Courant brought up a lot of issues with digital vs. physical intellectual property that has a lot to do with other mediums as well (and not just books). He pointed out that digital copies of things do not currently afford the kinds of things that physical copies do by virtue of simply existing in real life. He argued that there’s a lot of information contained in physical artifacts. When you walk into someone’s house, you see the books on their shelf and can make an estimate of who they are by what books they’ve read. Someone later pointed out that it isn’t necessarily which books they’ve read but which books they’ve bought! Another point is the legal ramifications of DRM of digital goods versus the common sense physical item. Courant asked hypothetically if he’d be able to leave his Kindle (and the books on it) to his kids when he dies. He has a number of books passed down from generation to generation. Will that stop with digital distribution? I tend to like the romanticized notion that physical items have a particular charm and historical value. I also think that digital information can also have some valuable information, especially in the form of metadata. The digital photo from your Canon SLR may not have the same qualities as film, but it could also contain metadata like where the photo was taken, when it was taken, camera settings and other stuff that’s very valuable. We might not be able to put things like Bill Gate’s computer into a museum like we do Galileo’s sketches, but think how cool it would be to have the revision history of a future great novel (assuming novelists keep their documents in a version control system…)! You could see all of the steps that the writer took, things they wrote and erased, and the order in which they produced a work. Now that I think of it, WordPress keeps a revision history of sorts, so I guess we’re not too far off that idea. It’s interesting to see how the “death of the book” is being described. It seems as though the general message of the day was that books were already dead (and long live the book). The decoupling of the book and its contents happened a long time ago. But for now, I think as long as people continue appreciating them (and I think enough do), the book will still exist as one of many vectors for the dissemination of information."

        "content": "At some point in the last week or two, I graduated from the University of Michigan School of Information with a Master’s of Science in Information. Yes, that last sentence was totally for SEO purposes. I figured I should write a blog post about it since I made a big deal about grad school in the past. So much so that I even made a blog for it . Maybe I should cross-post there. Nah, that blog is long-dead. In fact, it was totally dead until I just checked it and fixed a php bug that’s probably been there for two months… Oops! It’s fun to look back at my old posts and see what I was thinking (or attempting to portray what I was thinking) at the time. I went through a bunch of my posts when I was writing this post up, so I guess I can skip a lot and focus on the University experience. When I went to visiting days , I just coming from an interview with Google that I thought I had aced. Apparently I was wrong about that. I came in with a sort of nonchalant attitude. I think this was kinda good (being too serious is never a good thing) but also kinda bad (I might have not taken the visit as seriously as I should’ve). At the time I thought there were a pretty large number of non-technical peers for an HCI program, regardless of how interdisciplinary it was supposed to be. In hindsight I think this concern was reasonable for a CS person. I guess I don’t think of myself as a CS person anymore, though. One shock of the program I had to overcome was that people outside of it don’t know what to think of it. In my numerous job fair experiences , I noticed that recruiters really didn’t know what to do with me. “You have a computer science background, but you don’t want to write software!?” Well, sort of but not really. I lucked out and talked to a recent graduate who worked for Google. He told me that the ideal position I was describing had a name: Product Manager. That exchange really helped me solidify my goals for what I wanted to do after I graduated and what I should accomplish before I graduated. I should also note that I’m pretty lucky that I have a background in CS. Many of my classmates and peers in the program do not have a CS background, which makes finding an internship or job even harder for them. In a field that’s so new, we have a lot of explaining to do about why the skills we’re learning are valuable to employers. I’m able to explain it in relative terms (I’m like a software engineer + 1) whereas others have to define who they are from a blank slate, at least in terms the recruiters can understand. I had some great opportunities to do academic-style research. I did two independent studies: one on an audience-aware public display (using bluetooth, facial detection and a large touch screen display) and another on the reputation system of a large social network, CouchSurfing! For the latter I co-authored a paper. We’ll see if it gets into the conference June 1st! I tried to make sure that I experienced a full range of academia including normal classes, research and being involved with a student org. I think I did a good job, though I feel I might have overextended myself a bit. I sense this post is getting a bit tl;dr, as many of my posts tend to drift towards. So maybe I’ll just conclude. Back when I started thinking about applying to graduate schools, I did so because I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. At this point, I think I have a better understanding of what I want to do, generally. I should probably try and escape the ivory tower of academia, at least for a while, and see if doing real industry stuff is a good idea. Then again, I have been doing my own thing for as long as I’ve been programming. I had thought of applying to PhD programs but that process was cut short when I remembered how much I hate applying to grad school and also after I got a job offer in November. I think that making the leap and attending school for another two years was definitely worth it in terms of professional and personal growth. I don’t know if I can say the same for spending ~$70 for a cap, gown and hood that I wore for one ceremony…"

In addition to the “viral” quizzes that are really annoying (and occasionally interesting), the increase in random fan pages is really making the site hard to tolerate. Facebook wants to make fan pages like people. That’s fine, if you’re only allowing people to have fan pages. The fan pages seem to have been designed for entities who want to have a presence on the site. Like companies or celebrities, etc. Lately there have been fan pages for random shit like hugs, rain, flip flops, music, etc. Who is supposed to be the owner of the rain fan page? Who decides what rain says? I think groups were a fine way of indicating that you supported something. But fan pages are supposed to be pseudo-official (at least when celebrities make them, they are required to show proof of identity). This mixture of official and random-shit fan pages just makes Facebook seem unprofessional. I am all for developing tools and letting people use them for what they may. But maybe there should be some rules about superfluous junk like fan pages for “wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tubeman.” OR! Maybe I’m just getting old. *sigh*"

        "content": "I saw Kurt Elling w/ Ernie Watts at the Michigan Theater last Thursday. The program was billed as “Dedicated to You,” in which Kurt re-envisions songs from Coltrane/Hartman’s ballad album . I really like this album, so I approached the concert with some enthusiasm and also some apprehension. The instrumentation was kinda interesting. There was a combo as a base: Piano, Bass, Drums, Sax. Then there was a string quartet called ENRON or something (err, it was ETHEL) included in the instrumentation. This made the music seem a bit more fancy, but also more… orchestrated. I thought it took away from the jazziness of the performance. Like a real jazz performance will be a bit impromptu. The strings can’t really improvise along with the rest of the band (at least not in 4 part harmony) so everything is a little more rigid. Anyway, I think the set included all the songs on the aforementioned cd, but in different arrangements. Some were converted into non-ballads and I think one was played at ballad speed but in a double-time feel. Can’t really remember everything because I wasn’t taking notes. I do recall that I didn’t really like the arrangement for “My One and Only Love.” I thought it should’ve been given a real ballad treatment instead of the uptempo version that wasn’t very long. I mean, the concert wasn’t bad or anything. Not at all. Elling was a pretty good singer. Even though he kind of overdid the loungey moving away from the mic and then getting closer to it to change dynamics thing. You know what I mean? He also had some funny movements. He has a good voice, but he also seemed to mess around with the vocals a little too much. That’s okay for people who are familiar with the subject matter but for people hearing a standard ballad for the first time it makes it harder to listen to. I wonder if listening to the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra (a definitely old-school group) is making me kind of snotty. LCJO gets criticized for not being more modern. But I like the old school sound! There were times when the Elling group really got in the groove (or as we jazz musicians like to call it, “in the pocket”), which was great. I really like the straightahead jazz sound. I guess I really shouldn’t complain though. I was happy with the concert for the most part. Towards the end Elling brought out some old jazz singer dude. I didn’t know who he was at the time but I just looked it up and it was Jon Hendricks. He came on for the last two songs and scatted. The first was Bessie’s Blues , a Coltrane tune that wasn’t on the ballad cd. I think this was one of the times the group really jelled. Then they played Bye Bye Blackbird. Kurt sang the Miles Davis solo of it using some made up lyrics. It was kind of cool because I think a lot of people recognized that it was the Miles Davis solo and appreciated it. It’s also kind of cool because it requires secret jazz knowledge to pick up on it!!! Oh, and after I looked it up I learned that Jon Hendricks actually did this in 1986. So I guess Kurt was doing a tribute to Jon, while Jon was standing there. During Bye Bye Blackbird, Jon was taking a solo. It looked like he was taking a longer solo than everyone had anticipated, so I think Kurt was trying to figure out how to signal to him that the song needed to end. I mean, they were probably cool having him take the solo. But he most likely didn’t do a rehearsal with the guys. So it was pretty entertaining watching the guys figuring out how to end the song while the guy was taking a long ass solo. That’s how jazz people roll. The closers were definitely the right choice because they had high crowd-pleasing potential (blues and a well known standard). I think everyone left happy, including me. While I think the source material for the concert is timeless, and perhaps shouldn’t be messed with, they did an okay job and the concert as a standalone event was good. It’s kind of hard to please and live up to standards when you leave yourself open to comparison with Johnny Hartman and John Coltrane… ALSO: After doing even more research (lookin’ on Youtube) it seems as though Kurt sang with Bob Mintzer, one of my favorite mustached modern composers. Though apparently he didn’t sing “My Foolish Heart” on the album which I really, really like, he did sing it live with Bob . Neat-o."

This makes sense if you’re poor or really care about getting a good deal. Recently at SXSW, I considered the concept of customer service as explained by Tony Hsieh , the Zappos guy. Random thought: crap, I still need to finish my epic SXSW post! Tony argued that by focusing on customer service and, a step above that, customer happiness, you could grow your business based on word of mouth and repeat business. This makes sense for a retailer. It’s pretty wonderful how successful Zappos has become just by treating the customer like a king. Lately I’ve been working on projects that rely on software written by other companies. This concept is not new. I’ve been very frustrated by interacting with systems that don’t work well. Thinking back to the Zappos talk, I wonder if the customer service (and happiness) concept couldn’t be translated to giant software companies. Web apps are cool because they are relatively easy to build and the users are the most important part of them. They create much of the data and interactions between each other. Web apps have the potential to be highly scalable. What often ends up happening is that a small number of engineers work on an app that millions of people use. This is the case at places like Facebook and Google. Facebook’s job site currently states that it has less than 200 engineers and just a few days ago announced it had reached 200 million users. That’s a ratio of about 1 million users per engineer. I’m sure Google has similar insane ratios. What do these ratios mean for “customer service?” Basically that it doesn’t exist. And this leads to great frustration when I have an issue with the software. For example, I needed to rename a Facebook Page for work because there was a typo in the name. I filled out the contact form. Never got a reply. I did check the FAQ and yes, it stated that page names are not changeable. But why the hell not? It’s just a record in a database. The problem isn’t really that the name isn’t changeable; it’s that I get the feeling that no one is listening to me. I also had an issue with Google Apps and their gadget within Sites not working in IE. This is a pretty obscure error but upon inspection of the Google forums (which are actually kind of useful), it appears others have the same issue. But even though multiple users have complained, the Google spokespeople are happy to claim it’s an edge case and dismiss it by giving out urls to help articles that don’t resolve the issue. Again, it seems like they don’t care. I also had a problem with Google Forms being extremely volatile and absolutely not working correctly. I was literally wondering if anyone had run any kind of QA on the software before releasing it. Simply put, the software was not ready for deployment. Who could I voice my opinion to? No one, because Google is a faceless giant who doesn’t care what I think. And they shouldn’t care, because this user frustration is not hurting their bottom lines. For every frustrated user there are a thousand who aren’t frustrated. Those users will probably just go away and avoid putting more strain on Google’s massive infrastructure. Good riddance, right? I can’t imagine there is a good solution to the problem of too many users and not enough support. Forums help, but they can’t completely solve everyone’s problems, especially when the problems exist in bugs in the software. I wish companies would pay more attention to their “customers” when they had real issues with their products. But these companies are just way too massive to give personalized help. I imagine that some day there will be a massive backlash against this style of software design. Internet scale companies have a way of alienating users and making them feel as though their opinions really don’t matter. They take a “we know best” approach and make blanket decisions that will be good for 99% of the user base. When users protest a redesign of Facebook in aggregate, they might wield more power, but how influential are they, really? I guess open-source software might be able to fill niches where these giant companies fail. Case in point: WordPress, which I’m using to write this blog post (but who knows where my blog will reside in the future?) is thousands of times better than Google’s Blogger. My theory is that after Google bought Blogger, they moved it to their servers and promptly stopped caring about features, usability and general quality. In my opinion, Blogger is an anachronism. It sucks hard. WordPress, on the other hand, has been constantly improving thanks to contributions from volunteers. This is also probably the reason that WordPress kicked MovableType’s ass. So open-source software is quicker to improve and react to user needs. But how do you open-source social software that relies on network-effects like Facebook? I guess a decentralized model would work. Maybe a social network based on a protocol instead of a website. Does that sound a bit like twitter? Maybe, but probably not enough. For now, we’re still stuck accepting that we’re lowly users, unable to affect the status quo of applications owned by giant companies who don’t care what we think. Unless, of course, we are employed by those companies and really want to make a difference…"

        "content": "I just read some bad news that Microsoft is cutting back on its Live Labs group due to the “economy.” Microsoft spokeswoman Stacy Drake McCredy said the economy had forced the company to rethink the group’s mission. The death of Live Labs as it has existed, combined with Google’s decision to cut some of its more experimental products, raises the question of whether these kind of futuristic initiatives are falling out of fashion among leading internet companies, or are just a victim of this recession. This saddens me because I got really excited after reading an article in Fast Company about Gary Flake’s Live Labs and how innovative it was going to be. It seemed like a step in the right direction for a company that has a reputation for being boring (see John Hodgman in the Apple commercials). Microsoft has a ton of money. They should be spending it on research and development. The article mentions that Google is also cutting back on spending on 20% projects and killing off many of its labs projects. This is a situation where Microsoft shouldn’t be following Google’s lead. Instead of having a knee jerk reaction to try and save more money, they should be willing to take at least a few risks with some opportunity for a high return on investment. I’m really sick of seeing companies rationalize stupid behavior by invoking the “economy” as the reason. Perhaps, as the actual Live Labs Blog indicates , this is a move to focus the projects rather than spread themselves too thin. I’m not quite sure I buy this explanation, even as I notice that many Microsoft Live products seem under-promoted and downright bad. Live Mesh stinks compared to Dropbox, a competing startup. Inexplicably, Live Mesh does not share its storage capacity with another Live product, Sky Drive . Why one of these services hasn’t made the other obsolete is completely beyond me. Bad management? Bad communication? Something else? All of the above? It’s possible to focus on products and retain people to work on them. I was really excited about the potential for Live Labs. Now, it looks like they’ve been neutered and will be working on search. Yes, search needs work, but why sacrifice Live Labs for it? Hopefully there will still be a place in Microsoft where people can freely innovate and not worry about just the bottom line…"

        "content": "Last night I went to see Andrew Bird along with like 100 of my friends, lots from the School of Information. Is there something inherently Informational about Andrew Bird’s music? The opening act was a slightly avant garde group called “ A Hawk and a Hacksaw .” They had a guy on accordion (who played bass drum and cymbals with his legs), a girl on violin (?) and later a weird string instrument with what looked like a trumpet bell, a trumpeter and a tuba player. I noticed that they kept playing in weird time signatures (7, then 5, then 3, which is not totally weird but less common). The songs they played seemed a little too insane, like they were basically showing off. The lines were all really fast and it was hard to get a sense of any actual melody. They were pretty entertaining, nonetheless. Andrew Bird then came on by himself. He kept manipulating foot pedals so he could put things he was playing on infinite repeat. It was pretty cool. I wonder how he times it perfectly like that. I didn’t really know this before (I listened to his albums a few times previously) but he’s pretty much an expert whistler. He’s really good at whistling. He’s also really good at playing violin and guitar and singing. Which makes him a quadruple threat (quintuple threat if you count the foot pedal hijinks). He played a bunch of songs, many of which garnered lots of applause. I liked the “Nervous Tic Motion of the Head” song. I also like “Heretics” but he didn’t play that one. Those are like the two Andy Bird songs I really like. “Fiery Crash” is also good, and I think he also didn’t play that one. The other songs were all good too, but I just wasn’t as familiar with them as I would have liked. The mise-en-scene of the stage was pretty interesting. He had these giant horns in the back that looked like the old-school phonographs, but bigger. There was also a double horn thing that spun randomly, perhaps to indicate the climax of a song. I’m not even sure there was sound coming out of them, but they looked cool! Overall, Andrew Bird was a great performer (seeing him switch between instruments and hitting pedals on the ground and singing is entertaining by itself). His songs are also delightfully pretentious, with interesting lyrics (he rhymes “philharmonics” with “hooked on phonics”). Oh, and also, he seems to really like pentatonic scales (shoutout to Mr. Blakey, my high school band director for making us learn about scales!). If this concert were an eBay transaction, I’d have to leave a positive, “GREAT PERFORMER FAST CONCERT AWESOME SINGING A+++++++++ WOULD SEE AGAIN!!!11!11”"

        "content": "So there was this Microsoft ad that came out during an NCAA game. It featured a cute girl, Lauren, trying to decide which computer to buy. The voice of the ad (some omniscient being?) told her if she could find the kind she wanted under $1000 he’d buy it for her. The computer she wanted at the Apple Store was too expensive. She chose a Windows PC instead for $700. A lot of people have claimed the ad is a huge success. It hits Apple in its weak point: price. That may be true, but there’s also this thing called “value.” Apple computers have always been about quality. Software quality, build quality, design. While it’s true that the upfront costs of a Mac are higher than a PC, you get what you pay for. There are tradeoffs associated with buying an HP versus a Macbook. The specs are not the computer. I would argue that the amortized price of a Mac is probably about the same as a PC (or better). They’re built to last (even if Apple forces you to buy a new one every year or face inferiority). I’ve gone through too many Dell, HP and Toshiba laptops whose hinges explode. You can’t use a laptop after the hinge explodes. I haven’t had a Macbook explode yet (though the plastic did start coming off; it won’t happen on my aluminum Macbook Pro). Dell is trying to get into the premium PC market, which is great. But that sorta negates the price argument. In this economy it’s smart to play the price card, and people pay more attention to upfront costs than maintenance costs. Also, it’s not the best idea to try and sell your product by having a “real” person shop for PCs when the person turns out to be a professional (SAG) actress . It makes it seem more staged; this definitely is not a Pepsi Challenge. But hey, whatever. I think MS got their point across. Plus I forgive Lauren because she’s way cute! I just hope her back can handle lugging around a 17″ computer. Personally, I would advertise netbooks since they’re super cheap and Apple doesn’t have an equivalent, yet."

I don’t need people finding my (private) Facebook profile anyway. 4 is my Twitter profile. 5 is a LinkedIn profile of a Hung Truong that isn’t me either. 6 is a link to a person wiki of some kind called “AboutUs.” It’s basically an auto-generated wiki about my portfolio. I’ll count this as one in my favor. 7 is a news story about the Hung Truong that killed a police officer! Hopefully I don’t have to remind you, but that Hung Truong is not me ! 8 is a weird PDF about a Hung Truong who broke some laws by selling herbal medicine. Again, not me! 9 is a CNet page about me, my portfolio and Notecentric, for some reason. 10 is a page about a Dentist named Hung Truong. So I have the top 2 results for “Hung Truong” and 5/10 results are about me in some way. Not too bad!

My first thought was that it was sad that Earth Day was downsized to last just an hour. My second thought was that, while the activity is a nice gesture of wanting to help the environment, it probably does little to actually affect anything in the long term. I’m no electrical engineer, but the way I understand it, power plants adjust their output according to power usage. So they use less fuel at night and more during the peak hours of the day. Turning your lights off for an hour will probably just make the power plants less effective unless they anticipate or quickly adjust to the lower amounts of power being drawn. It’s sorta like how having a one-day gas boycott doesn’t really do anything. Earth Hour seems like a sad indicator of how lazy we are as humans. It’s like a band-aid. “If I turn my lights off for an hour, I’m saving the planet!” You could also just switch to a different type of lightbulb and have a much better amortized effect on the environment, or ride a bike instead of driving. Who’s willing to bet that the same people who switch their lights off for an hour also leave their TVs and other standby electronics plugged in when they’re not using them?"

Personally I couldn’t be happier with the way things turned out, so I generally say good stuff, but I guess I could also tell them to leave and never come back if I wanted. Anyway, it seems as though I’m the only person who ever wrote a blog about applying to grad schools. Because a lot of people who meet me at visiting days tell me they’ve read my blog. This is kind of weird and kind of flattering as it means my page rank for certain queries is high, and also that these people know stuff about me before even meeting me. One guy even knew about my side project, Anime Nano and listened to my podcast! I playfully referred to the people who knew me from the internet as my “stalkers.” Hopefully I won’t ever have real stalkers. The crazy kind. Anyway, it wasn’t weird hanging out with these people or anything. I was actually pretty stoked to meet a “user” of one of my sites in real life! Plus I’ll never actually see these peeps again since I’m graduating before they come here. And yes, I intentionally titled this blog post to get another entry high in the Google query for “SI Visiting Days,” though it seems that one of my peers is beating me at the moment."

        "content": "I sorta participated in the HackU event that Yahoo sponsored at my school. I say sorta because I got back in from SXSW on Tuesday night (post about that forthcoming) and missed the kick-off. First off, I gotta say something about the name. HackU. Is that like a pun on something? Anyway, on Wednesday the Yahoo guys went over some stuff on semantic web, search monkey and BOSS. Apparently, the customized search results are the “carrot” on the stick for content producers to markup their content semantically. The Yahoos noted that the customized results provide better click-through rate. While that’s a nice way to think about incentivizing the semantic web, I see a few flaws. First off, the increased click-throughs are probably due to the pretty graphics and stuff. What happens when everyone has customized search results? The search results page gets cluttered and looks like crap. Furthermore, an increase of click-through in a search engine that has 20% of the search engine market (says Comscore… the numbers for my sites are more like 2-3%) is not much. In my case I’d probably be better off spending my time doing other SEO stuff for Google. Yeah, this is kind of harsh to say (I didn’t say it to the Yahoo guys’ faces) but it’s also realistic. Honestly, I do hope search monkey and BOSS end up being successful, for Yahoo’s sake. As far as swag goes, I picked up a brown Search Monkey shirt on the way out. Oh, and they served some tasty Indian food. Anyway, I missed the Yahoo events on Thursday. Apparently they did some presentations, then went to a bar. Instead, I had fun at the video game archive and my student org, SCSI. Then on Friday, the 24-hour hackathon thing started. I got there at 4pm and ate some food (it came in waves, burritos, pizza, snacks, Red Bull, soda, etc). They had a different shirt this time, a black one with a wizard on it! I started trying to figure out what to hack on and came up with an addition to a site that I’ve slowly been working on, What is Hung Doing? Note to self: I think I need to write a blog post on WiHD as well. Basically, I thought it’d be cool to add my location to the site (I was hoping that Google Latitude would be able to do this but I guess it doesn’t offer an API). I used Fire Eagle and the iPhone app called Sparrow to update my location. To grab the location I just made a new application on my server. I dunno the best way to present this info. I’ll fix it up later. I got the location stuff working and promptly decided to go home around 2am. No 24-hour hacking for me. On Saturday (today), I got up and ran some errands. I bought groceries and got a haircut, then raced back to the CS building on North Campus to do my presentation for WiHD. There were some really neat hacks that were shown off today. One of my friends from the School of Information even won 3rd place. I ended up with a novelty award: “Wannabee Internet Stalkee” or something like that, because WiHD basically enables stalkers. But hey, if it keeps them online instead of around me, then it’s okay, right? Finally, I picked up my final shirt (It has a dragon and a kung-fu guy on it) and went home, along with my award: Not too bad for just hacking away at my own project. It’s nice to see Yahoo come and show some goodwill to our school, especially since they skipped out on the career fairs this year. I wonder if they’re even hiring. Either way, I got three shirts, an official Yahoo Faceball , a random puzzle ball and an award, so I’m pretty happy."

Almost two years ago, I wrote that: Now, I actually use the Facebook updates now and then, but it seems like people who use Twitter do this to the max. Like they update multiple times a day. Are these people so self-centered that they think everyone needs to know what they’re doing? … In Twitter, the ability to update is the entire application itself. To me, Twitter is simply a subset of what Facebook already provides. Why would you ever need both? This historical post is both illuminating and funny for a number of reasons. Apparently in the past I hardly updated my Facebook status at all. These days I probably do so at least once a day, and usually multiple times a day. I guess that’s just an indicator of how social norms have changed in regards to sharing personal information online: what was thought of as “oversharing” in the past is basically normal now. It’s also funny that I recognized that Twitter was a subset of Facebook. Recently I’ve come to believe that being a subset is actually a feature. I think Twitter hit critical mass for me somewhere in the last few months. So really, my previous opinions of it being pointless weren’t necessarily incorrect. It just didn’t hold any value for me. Now that the value of Twitter (in my own usage) is improving due to network effects , I use it more often. I think the appeal of Twitter comes down to this: There is a much better signal-to-noise ratio at this point using Twitter versus Facebook. On Facebook I get updates about everything that everyone I have ever known (and befriended) has ever done! I don’t care about pictures of drunk cheerleaders who I was friends with in undergrad. But Facebook feeds them to me. I really should remove them at some point, but oh well, such is social networking. For now, Twitter has a much more relevant set of messages. I’ve also noticed that people are much more likely to respond to me via Twitter, versus commenting on a Facebook status. Probably due to the noise/signal thing again. It’s easy for me to simply “unfollow” someone who is not providing me with relevant or funny information. Sadly, the relevance factor of Twitter is probably a temporary quality. Facebook used to have a low S/N ratio until everyone joined it. Twitter may face the same problem if it can grow like Facebook did (lol at scaling). It’s interesting to look at all of this in the context of history. I used ujournal before I used Xanga before I used livejournal before I used MySpace (ick) before I used Facebook before I used Twitter before I used (fill in the blank)…"

When Wynton announced that they were gonna play “Blues Walk,” I expected a pretty uptempo major straightahead bebop blues. But apparently there is a difference between Blues Walk and The Blues Walk . Wynton is pretty good at telling random stories. Like he talked about Lee Morgan and his funny-named albums: “Delightfulee,” “Cornbread,” “The Rumproller.” One of the band members mentioned “The Gigolo” and then Wynton Marsalis made a quip about how that’s why Lee Morgan isn’t here with us today (he was cheating on his girlfriend and she shot him. Sometimes, though, I really think that Wynton is making shit up! Okay, not really. He just knows a lot about Jazz and Jazz history. And classical music. He’s pretty much a genius.

        "content": "I have written about Jonathan Coulton in the past . Last Friday, I got a chance to actually see him perform live, in front of my own eyes! First, however, the opening band had to play for a while. The band in question was “Paul and Storm,” which I like to call, “Paul and the Storm.” But apparently Storm is a human being. And it’s a guy, not the female X-Man (oxymoron?) who controls lightning. Their first song was about how they’re the opening band, and no one paid to hear them and we hope that they leave soon so Jonathan Coulton could get on stage. At least they have a good sense of humor about it! Their songs were pretty interesting for the most part. They had a way of choreographing things (Paul was always doing something with his hands) that kept it interesting and their harmonies were pretty sweet. They also gave out random prizes like an uncomfortably small Batman mask and monkey keychain that lit up and made monkey noises. Before the show, Jonathan Coulton asked for requests from the audience via The Twitter. I like calling it “The Twitter.” Don’t judge me for that. Anyway, I requested “ Octopus ” and the song he plays on the John Hodgman audio book . I figured he probably wouldn’t play the Hodgman one since Hodgman wasn’t there to read his part. But I really like that song. Especially the part where he whispers “Dungeons &amp; Dragons, monsters and magical spells!” I didn’t request the more popular ones because I figured he has to play First of May and Skullcrusher Mountain and Code Monkey . Oh, I should mention I went with my friend Kathleen. We both noticed that the entire Ark was a nerd herd. Like seriously, all kinds of nerds were there. And it was okay to show your nerdiness! I think this is probably how it feels to go to a comic book or Star Trek convention. There were lots of references to nerd stuff like Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan ( Botany Bay ?) and Hitchhiker’s Guide. Also, it was pretty apparent that the crowd really knew Coulton’s work. Because at the funny parts, no one really laughed (Like during First of May, for example) except maybe as a polite gesture, and during Skullcrusher Mountain, JoCo let the audience sing the chorus once. And it was loud and perfect. This sort of scared both me and my compatriot. Also, everyone knew what to do for the audience participation in “Re: Your Brains.” JoCo pretty much owned this crowd. And the crowd was generous to JoCo, showering him with gifts like a Starbucks gift card, a half pony/monkey monster (to please him), a toy monkey with banana candy inside of its transparent stomach and for some reason they had him sign a cake (I dunno if he got any of it). Overall the show was good times. Coulton sings in pretty much the same voice as he does in his recordings. So I can safely say that he’s not being overproduced or something like a boy band. Though it should be noted that he cannot sing harmonies with himself live. That’s what Paul and the Storm are for. At one point in the concert I realized just how weird his songs were, and that the audience was just as weird. The moment was when stated, matter-of-factly: “ This is a song about a giant squid who hates himself .” And then he played the song! Coulton did the whole “this is the last song” and then came back as an encore, and noted how cheesy it is to do that. But it’s sort of necessary. Unfortunately he only played two songs for his encore and didn’t come back for an encore #2. But you gotta leave the audience wanting more. I wanted to hear “ Tom Cruise Crazy .” I guess it’ll have to wait for next time."

        "url": "/blog/2009/03/04/managing-rejection-and-success/",
        "content": "Over the past few years, I’ve found myself in a number of situations where I’ve been rejected. I read an article via BoingBoing on why some people see failure as crippling, while others see it as a motivator . Pretty interesting stuff. I have the book on hold at the library. I guess I fall into the latter category as I haven’t really let my numerous failures drag me down. When I was fresh out of college (for the first time), I got an amazing opportunity to interview at Google. If you were a CS major in 2006, Google was pretty much the holy grail. In my mind, it definitely was (well, maybe second to Facebook, but they never got back to me). Like many of my adventures, I wrote about this in a blog post . Long story short, I was rejected. I think at that point I was a bit cocky and thought Google was a sure thing. You should never have a sense of entitlement; that leads down a pretty depressing path. Getting rejected was a good wake-up call that I needed to improve myself if I wanted to end up with my dream job. At the time I thought I had missed an amazing opportunity. This may have been true; I’ll never know what my life would be like if I had started working at Google. Looking back, though, I think the rejection was really a blessing. Maybe the reason I’ve been able to rebound from rejections in the past was that they’ve always been balanced with acceptances. At the same time, I was looking at grad schools. Rejection after rejection (after rejection after rejection ) came in. But luckily there was a acceptance as well. And it was the school I wanted to go to the most , with full funding ! During the time between my graduation (and Google rejection) and the start of grad school, I had some fun making random web apps like MapsKrieg . This actually led to an opportunity for me to work with a startup called LiveByCampus. It was a pretty neat experience. Who knows, it might also lead to another opportunity some day. In grad school, I had a lot of fun trying to get internships at companies I thought were really cool. And since I was developing all these new skills, I’d get hired for sure, right? Okay, I actually tried to be a bit more humble this time around. For a while, I was very successful in replicating my previous results of being rejected by Facebook , Microsoft , Apple , Zazzle and a number of other companies that didn’t even bother replying to me to tell me I was rejected. I guess I was sorta in a slump again. Then I was selected (along with my teammates Adam and Gaurav) by RPM Ventures to start a company over last Summer. I realize I haven’t really written much about Troubadour Mobile (our website is very outdated) on my blog. Perhaps I should. To make a long story short, however, Troubadour Mobile turned out to be the best possible internship I could’ve had. Sidenote: There’s this psychological idea that people will look back at events and see that what ended up happening was the best thing that could’ve happened. I read about this in Stumbling on Happiness . In some cases, people who lost limbs ended up saying it was the best thing to ever happen to them. I don’t think I’m showing this behavior here, but I acknowledge that I could be. End sidenote. At Troubdour Mobile I had an awesome experience in entrepreneurship. We started an actual company. We got stock certificates! We paid taxes this year! We printed t-shirts! We didn’t, however, get business cards. I guess we were too busy writing an awesome prototype application for the iPhone! I learned a great deal at Troubadour and had a blast. While I was very happy with the company, I wasn’t sure if I could take the plunge and attempt to live off of a scantily funded student startup after graduation. So I once again began looking for other opportunities. And I still found myself with some rejection (isn’t there some kind of three-strike rule for getting rejected by Facebook?). But I had much better luck this time. I think that the Troubadour Mobile experience had a lot to do with it, but I’m not entirely sure. I successfully interviewed at Orbitz in Chicago (great company and city, btw) and then at Microsoft in Seattle (also a great company (and city), despite what I’ve written previously in this blog, hahaha!). And so I find myself here in the present. I’m finishing up grad school and will be graduating in May. I’ll be starting as a Program Manager at Microsoft in September. Hopefully I’ll have some time off over the Summer to chill (I’m also going to SXSW with Troubadour Mobile in a few weeks!). It was through a series of failures and successes, rejections and realizations that I made it here. I think I learned something like a microcosm of this during my stint in entrepreneurship: you don’t just come up with a grand idea and implement it, making millions of dollars. An idea is prototyped and polished before it becomes successful. You come up with a million bad ideas, improving every time. In the same way, I learned from all of my rejections and improved myself along the way until I was able to land what I think will be a sweet job. Yet I’m sure that this isn’t the end of my failing and learning process. So what’s the big take away? I think it’s that you can never be sure what counts as a true failure and what counts as true success. You can only try your best and keep adjusting along the way to try and get to where you want to be. Had I not been rejected by Google, I would have never gotten the chance to go to school at Michigan, meet many of the great friends I have now and end up with an awesome position at Microsoft. I can’t say the alternate universe version of me at Google wouldn’t have turned out better, but I can say that I am very happy with the way things turned out in this universe. I also think a large part of success has to do with skill, luck and perseverance. While I believe I’m skilled, I also know I’ve been very lucky. While dumb luck helps a lot, I’ve also tried very hard to make my own luck. To me, this means creating opportunities, working harder to reach out to people and being proactive. You could wait for an opportunity to fall into your lap, but it’s always a good idea to try and speed up the process with a nudge. tl;dr ? If you find yourself overwhelmed by what you perceive as failures and rejections, stay positive. Keep trying. Failures always come with a bit of information about how we can improve for the next time. And if you keep improving, it’s only a matter of time before you find success."

Mucinex tears families apart. Families of the mucus variety. Anyway, I used it and it seems to be okay. It didn’t work in the elaborately theatrical fashion as the commercials would have me believe, but I think I have less junk in my chest now than before."

The Aebersold track is fun and all, but playing with it makes me feel as though I’m playing as the accompaniment, rather than with the accompaniment. So here’s a sans-backing version of My Funny Valentine. The sound quality came out okay, though the silent brass makes it sounds a bit stuffy and adds a lot of backpressure to the horn. But I guess it’s still better than playing without a mute and pissing off my neighbors. It works great for practicing; recording not so much. The headphones are also pretty sweet. I haven’t used them that much. I mainly use them for listening to This American Life while doing dishes. They block outside sound pretty well. Oh, and in case you’re wondering, yes, I stole stuff from Miles and Wynton. I hope they don’t mind. Previously: Each Day is Valentine’s Day .

Basically, the people in charge need to be able to make new pages and edit the existing ones when I leave. I was trying to figure out how to do this without a CMS. Because I can’t just throw a CMS into the web server. I have a friend who wrote something for his portfolio that involves making an xml file, then using the xml to make an HTML page. I was curious to see if this was some kind of common paradigm, and if so, if there were frameworks I could use. The ideal situation would be if I could just set up some XML schema for people to fill in content and then somehow create the HTML from that. Then whoever was updating it would just update the XML (which would be fairly easy since they wouldn’t worry about markup, just the data). I came across another old friend’s framework, Onion ML , while searching for a solution. It’s pretty funny that I went to undergrad with this guy but just found his site by looking up my own keywords. The Onion ML thing led me to XSLT , which seems to be the solution to my problem. Apparently XSLT is a way to transform XML into HTML (or something else that’s useful). Unfortunately, XSLT seems a bit more complicated than I was hoping. It looks like the style is defined in one file, then the XML is in another, then there needs to be a way to smash the two together (at running time). I guess there are ways to do this using javascript but I haven’t gotten that far yet. So what’s the point of this post? I dunno. Probably just to document my thought process on how I got this far. Next step is to see if XSLT can make the job easier or make it needlessly complex (it seems to be a technology that was popular in the early 2000’s, if all these Google searches are correct)."

The contest deadline was the day after Christmas, which was cool because I had some free time to make an entry. You can see my entry above. Click on it to see the big version. Here’s the text that accompanied it: I have a shiny new Macbook Pro running OS X 10.5 for development since it’s got those command line tools I know and love. (I don’t use spaces normally but it’s a good way to show everything) Quadrant #1: vim is better than Emacs, let’s just get that out of the way (I hope the Facebook judges agree)! I use vim for most of my coding unless I’m working with something slightly complicated. For local editing textedit works well. I might also go with DashCode or TextMate if I feel like getting fancy. Quadrant #2: I use XCode because it’s required to do any coding on the iPhone. Just between us, XCode blows. It’s pretty retarded in the autocomplete and syntax highlighting departments. Quadrant #3: Firefox and the Firebug plugin are the best thing to happen to design/CSS coding since… sliced bread. I really love Firebug. Oh, and I use Cyberduck for FTPing if I’m not feeling like using scp. Quadrant #4: My wallpaper consists of dinosaurs with lasers. It’ the awesomest picture I’ve found so far. When I find an awesomer one, I might think about replacing it. As per the explanation of why I won: Vim + not-windows + xcode blows + dinosaurs with lasers = win I mean, can you beat dinosaurs and lasers? Yep, I pretty much won because of the awesome wallpaper I utilize. It really is pretty sweet. You should follow my example and use it as well . Maybe it’ll win you a contest someday! For my trouble, I get: An iPod Touch 16GB A RipStik Classic A pair of Sennheiser HD-280 Pro headphones A limited puzzle T-shirt (I’ll post a picture when I get it) A job at Facebook (editor’s note: I wish!) I also get the privilege of having lunch with some Facebook engineers when I’m in the area. This is probably the neatest prize of all since Facebook is way cool and I’ve never been to their headquarters before. I’ve been to the Googleplex, the Appleplex (I don’t think it’s really called that) and the Microsoft Campus in Redmond, so this is pretty much the last stop in the list of software places I need to see before I die. Anyway, I’m way grateful to Facebook for liking my entry enough to make it the grand prize winner. I had fun making it. I’ve gotten a raincheck on having lunch with Facebookers, so maybe during Spring Break or over the Summer I’ll report back on how it went."

I was dreaming that I was half-asleep. Maybe I really was half-asleep and just hallucinating. I’m not entirely sure. Anyway, I dreamed that I was sleeping in my parent’s bed. In-between both of them. Kinda funny huh? That’s not what made it bad. I also dreamed there was something flying around the room. It was kind of hard to tell what, but I sensed it was leathery. Like, say, a bat . Then, as I realized the flying object really was a bat, it decided to fly onto my neck and bite it! You know how in dreams you sort of do things in slow-motion? So sometimes you know something is inevitable, but you still try to stop it anyway? This was how the bite felt. As the bat bit me (I swear I felt pain), I woke up like in the movies where someone wakes up from a bad dream. I literally checked my neck to see if a bat was biting me. And to see if my parents were in my bed. Luckily neither of these things happened. I went back to sleep. Then I had another dream. This time, I was watching TV, waiting to leave to the airport. As I was watching some sitcom (unfortunately I can’t remember which), my dad told me, “hey, aren’t you late for your flight?” I didn’t realize that it was 3:15 AM, and my flight left at 3:30 AM! I hurried to the airport, picked up my ticket (which looked like a receipt) from a drive-up booth (apparently this was faster) and went into the airport. Somehow, I went a special way that I didn’t have to go through security! I sorta pretended to get into line from the end, just to make sure no one accused me of jumping the security. Then I think my flight must’ve left, because I was just sitting in the airport. I noticed that someone left a bag lying around. I thought it might be a bomb! But it turns out it was just a bunch of metal tools that the guy wasn’t allowed to take, I guess. Now that I think of it, I wonder why they would’ve been allowed into the “sterile” area. Anyway, I took the tools and for some reason there was some kind of pawn shop in the airport. I sold the tools for $8 and some change! I think it might’ve been $8.11. I’m not sure. The third dream I had was where I was in some kind of RPG video game. I was semi-in the game and semi-playing the game. At one point I stepped outside of a dungeon, then went back inside. Then I fought a battle in which I lost. AND I REALIZED I DIDN’T SAVE THE GAME! But then apparently I had saved it when I stepped out of the dungeon. So I guess this wasn’t actually a bad dream, just a potentially bad situation that never happened…"

        "content": "A few weeks ago I made a trip with a bunch of colleagues/friends to go see some Jazz in Detroit. We went to a place called “Baker’s Keyboard Lounge,” which is apparently the oldest jazz club, ever. That night, a group played which I would describe as a “mixed bag.” The rhythm section was outstanding, but the sax player was okay and the trumpet player (who was, sadly, also the bandleader) was in serious need of some lessons in improvisation. Most of the people I went with weren’t Jazz connoisseurs. I sort of think of myself as an intermediate one since I’ve been involved with Jazz (playing and listening) since middle school. Anyway, I promised I’d make a Jazz primer for those interested, and I kind of let it get onto the backburner for a while. I could’ve just grabbed some tracks but I wanted to comment on what to listen to or what I liked about each track so it would be more accessible (Jazz is hard to get into if you don’t know what to look for). Basically I went through my music collection looking for tracks that I thought were representative of something. Either of a standard tune or an artist or a genre. I tried not to duplicate songs or artists. It was kinda hard. I found what tracks I could that were available on AmazonMP3. So if you wanted, you could download almost the whole mix legally! The MP3 widget and my liner notes follow: 1. Antonio Carlos Jobim - Wave One thing I always suggest to do when learning Jazz standards is to learn the words. The words for Wave are really cheesy. Example: “When I saw you first the time was half past three/When your eyes met mine it was eternity” Antonio’s famous for “Girl From Ipanema” but Wave is also pretty classic. 2. Art Blakey - My Romance Art Blakey is a weird sorta monolith in jazz. I think he’s famous for having a group (The Jazz Messengers) that’s always featuring new talent. When the musicians “graduate” from the group, new ones take their place. Former members include Lee Morgan, Freddie Hubbard, Wynton Marsalis and Terence Blanchard (so what if I mention just the trumpet players? They’re good)! I also like this song because of the lyrics and the group just sounds really great live! For more on the actual song, see this post that I wrote when I had the song stuck in my head ! 3. Bill Evans - Autumn Leaves Autumn Leaves is like the quintessential Jazz standard. By “standard” I mean that if you’re a gigging musician, it’s a song you need to know. Since everyone knows the standards, you can just get a random group of guys together and instantly jam out. There’s a lot of versions of Autumn Leaves that I like (including one by Chet Baker) but I thought I’d include some Bill Evans love. 4. Bob Mintzer – Oye Como Va Bob Mintzer is a Jazz saxophonist who does contemporary sounding (but not too contemporary) arrangements for his big band. Oye Como Va was made famous by Santana, but it was originally composed by the Latin Jazz dude, Tito Puente. Bob Mintzer always changes something up when he puts his own spin on things. Here, he messes with the head itself. When the trumpets come into the melody, they play the it syncopated. He’s also kind of known for adding “noodly parts” (as my old Jazz Band director Glenn Kostur would say) in the background. You could listen to a Bob Mintzer tune a few times and still not catch everything going on in the background. 5. Bobby Shew – Cubana Chant Bobby Shew is from Albuquerque, just like me! Once I went to see him when he came back and I got him to autograph my shoe! Unfortunately it was the bottom of my shoe and when I walked around for a little the autograph faded away. TRUE STORY! Bobby was primarily a lead player (played high notes) and later on started doing improvisation as well. He’s not as good as many players, but at least he’s better at improvising than Maynard Ferguson… Cubana Chant is a tune that I played in my high school combo my senior year. I probably still have the video, actually. Maybe I should post it online some time… It’s sort of interesting because the changes (the chord progression) is basically rhythm changes (from I’ve Got Rhythm) but in a minor progression. Rad. 6. Charles Mingus – Haitian Fight Song Charles Mingus is a badass bassist. A lot of his compositions are outside of the “norm” of Jazz. I guess Haitian Fight Song is actually pretty “in” when you think about it. I played “Fables of Faubus” in high school, but I figured I’d include this because it’s a bit “easier” to listen to, being a minor blues and all. 7. Charlie Parker – Scrapple From the Apple Charlie Parker’s nickname was “bird,” mainly because he had an actual bird’s beak and feathers. Just kidding. Scrapple From the Apple is your typical early bebop tune. A sorta complicated head followed by some pretty complicated solos. Pretty much just dudes trying to one-up each other. This tune is pretty much synonymous with Charlie Parker, so I figured, why not? 8. Chet Baker – There Will Never Be Another You This is one of my favorite standards. It’s not really that well known, though, I guess. The lyrics are cool and so are the changes. It’s not too often that the lyrics to a song match the music perfectly. This is off the album “Chet Baker Sings,” so it’s nice to hear him play and then sing (like a girl). 9. Clifford Brown – Blues Walk Clifford Brown was a super awesome virtuoso trumpet player who could play bebop insanely well. He died young (at 25) but he left a huge impact on Jazz anyway. Clifford died in a car crash. My friend Mark says that’s why you don’t let women drive you around! Anyway, Benny Golson wrote “I Remember Clifford” in his memory. Ironically, it’s a ballad (and not super fast bebop as Clifford was famous for). Also, this is why you never hear recordings of Clifford Brown playing “I Remember Clifford,” unless you’re stuck in some kind of paradox alternate universe. But he does play Blues Walk pretty damn well. Check out near the end of the song where Clifford and the sax player (sorry, unnamed sax player) trade ever decreasing amounts of measure! Pretty sweet. 10. Dexter Gordon – Confirmation Dexter Gordon is a tenor sax bebop-ist who I got into because my friend Mark (also a tenor sax bebop-ist) was into him. Dexter Gordon has a helluva lot of recordings. One thing that’s apparent is that he’s pretty good. Another thing that’s apparent is that if you listen to more than one solo of his, you’ll hear him play the same riffs in each one. Nothing wrong with that, but Dexter Gordon makes it kinda more apparent than any other Jazz artist I’ve heard (besides myself, since I always use the same three patterns). Confirmation is another bebop tune that has an extremely complicated melody. It’s like they made it hard on purpose just to show off. 11. Dizzy Gillespie – Manteca Dizzy Gillespie is the trumpet player that’s famous for having the puffy cheeks and the funny trumpet with the bell at a 45 degree angle. If you’re a trumpet player, don’t do that (unless your name is Dizzy Gillespie)! Dizzy is also famous for being a pretty good bebop player and pioneering the Afro-Cuban style of Jazz. If you’re wondering what that is, just listen to the percussion. 12. Ella Fitzgerald + Louis Armstrong – A Fine Romance I like vocal Jazz. Ella and Louis did two recordings singing together. It’s funny because it makes me think they were a couple, with them singing so many love songs together. Their recordings are also funny because Louis’ raspy voice is continually juxtaposed by Ella’s super smooth voice. Also, Louie Armstrong says “bitches” in this song! 13. Freddie Hubbard – Up Jumped Spring Up Jumped Spring’s got a pretty interesting melody and changes. Freddie Hubbard has a really sweet tone. It’s like a perfect combination. Plus he composed this song himself, so I suppose it makes sense that this is a good recording… Current Events Alert! Freddie Hubbard died on December 29th, which comes after I made this list but before I published it! 14. Harry Connick Jr. – Basin Street Blues ..."

It was pretty good except for the fact that I ordered a blue corn spinach enchilada and I got a normal enchilada, but I only realized it after I ate about 90% of it because I was hungry for green chile. Anyway, after the lunch we went to scope out the area. The “Brick Light District,” as it’s called, is fairly new. It wasn’t there when I went to UNM. I saw this store that had a sign: “ Tokyo Hardcore Pop Culture Shoppe .” We went in. The first thing I noticed was a Domo-kun plushie. Pretty cool. Then I noticed some other random Japanese culture stuff. Hello Kitty stuff, birthday candles that spelled out “omedetou,” vinyl toys, etc. It kind of reminded me of Wizzywig , except with less emphasis on video game and anime pop culture and more on fashion and toy culture. I talked to the store clerk girl for a little bit about the store. Apparently there are less people that come in who are “our age” and more really young people and fairly old people. Interesting. She said they opened maybe a few months ago and that they’re getting cool new items in regularly. I’m pretty happy that a store like this exists in my (former) town. I think it adds a lot to the vibe that Albuquerque is one of those culturally interesting cities. I think I read somewhere that we’re somewhere up there with Austin and Seattle, etc. So I hope the store does well. Also, the girl at the counter was really cute, in that Suicide Girls kind of way."

        "content": "Today, December 18th (it might be the 19th by the time I finish this post), is my good friend Wolfie’s birthday. His name is John, but his nickname is Wolfie. It might seem weird for me to write a post about my pal’s birthday. I guess the reason I’m writing it is because Wolfie passed away this Summer while on a trip in Barcelona, Spain. He would’ve been 25 today. I could be sad and dwell on how unfair it was that Wolfie wasn’t able to even see his 25th birthday. But when I think about him, it’s really hard to be sad, or mad, or anything besides happy. We had some really good times, and I’m really glad I was able to meet him. He was one of my best friends for a good portion of high school. And we had great antics. Like the times we (and Patrick) went to the state fair and annoyed people on the expo floor, or the time Wolfie sneaked into David Tod’s house to steal a picture of David Tod in a bunny suit on Easter, scanned it and replaced it while I stood lookout a la Hitchcock’s Rear Window, or the time we recorded a drum, guitar and trumpet track of a song with just the two of us, or all the random junk we did on band trips. He didn’t have a lot of time here, but he sure packed a lot into what he had. I guess it sounds cliche, but it’s true. And in a way, Wolfie has really inspired me to make the most of my time. I really hope that I never end up sleepwalking through life, aimless, because that would be a waste of time that I have, that Wolfie never had. While I’m writing about lessons, I also want to say that throughout everything that happened, Wolfie’s mother, Mera, has been nothing but positive. She sent an email (which I won’t reproduce without her permission) reminding us to celebrate his life, all the good times, etc. She’s really the sweetest person I’ve ever met. Much love to her (I hope I can catch up with her before I leave town this time). She’s an inspiration and I hope I can be more like her someday. In conclusion: Happy Birthday, Wolfie! I miss you."

I just finished my final stuff yesterday, so the semi-annual dream came right on time, last night! It always involves some random class I signed up for at the beginning of the semester that I stop showing up to. Then I realize, maybe on the bus or something, that I totally forgot to do any work for it!!! This semester it was some made up class on something analysis. The reason I didn’t go is because the teacher was really bad. For some reason the teacher was Jay Boyden, a grad student assistant from when I was in marching band in undergrad. No idea why he was in that role because he’s actually a good teacher! My series of dreams last night also involved some interesting sub-plots. One was that I was using my computer to show my brother something, then the browser was being really slow switching from Youtube to whatever other tab I had open. So I blamed this on the OS and remembered I had a copy of Vista! So I formatted the hard drive out of frustration and was going to find the Vista disc. But then I realized I had left the disc in Michigan, and for some reason I was in New Mexico for the dream (I wonder what my computer was doing in NM while my stuff was in MI). So I just had a formatted computer. Then another sub-plot was sorta in the world of “ I Am Legend ” and sorta in the world of “ Fallout 3 .” There was a town I was trying to get to but a zombie town was in-between it! I think the zombies couldn’t get out at night. But it WAS at night. Luckily some motorcycle gang was there to shoot flamethrowers at the zombie town so I could pass. Before this happened, though, there was huge pomp and circumstance. Like the motorcycles all came in formation and stuff. Then the zombies were kind of trash talking the gang. They said something like, “you guys are done for when you eventually run out of gasoline!” Then the gang torched the zombies and I was on my way. So yeah, I’m looking forward to my final semi-annual post-final bad dream some time in May when I graduate!"

        "content": "I have been noticeably absent in this blog and others this month. So in typical Hung Truong Blog fashion, I felt like I should write about what’s going on in my life, including my everlasting job hunt. I know some have gained quite a lot of pleasure in reading about my various job hunt activities . Job hunting is kind of fun, especially when you’re in school and you don’t actually have a dire need for a job (well, I already have a job, but I know it’s gonna run out when I graduate). Anyway, last weekend I interviewed at Microsoft for a Program Manager position. You might recall that I interviewed with Orbitz a few weeks prior. I got an offer from Orbitz and let the recruiters at MS know. Then the MS recruiters hurried up the process and let me interview with them. Pretty cool! I ended up declining the Orbitz offer (but it was awesome and I would have taken it if I hadn’t gotten a better offer, more on that later). Um, I realize at this point that in the interest of actually getting a job, I should be neutral when I talk about companies. Luckily, all of the companies I’ve dealt with so far have been class acts. So I don’t really need to hold anything back. They’ve been awesome. The whole experience of job hunting has been a real eye-opener for me. From exploding offers and figuring out offer goodness, I’ve been learning a lot. So anyway, I flew to Seattle and got there at around 11am. I got a rental car (a Toyota Highlander SUV) and drove to the Pike Place Market , which is apparently one of the really cool places to see. I got lunch there and wandered around various shops. Then I decided to go to the Seattle Library , which is really super awesome. And being a student at a library school, I knew I needed to check it out. The library had multiple floors of awesome. The decor in there is like Ikea, except cooler! And it’s in a library! On my interview day, I tried leaving early but it took me a while to find Building 19 (the HR building) where I was supposed to meet with my recruiter. Microsoft campus is huge-ass. I was a little late. 19 is probably the spiffiest building I encountered, with its sorta dim lighting (for mood), Microsoft Surface to play with, and Rock Band! There were a lot of other students there waiting for their recruiter to get them. They all seemed kinda nervous. It was hard to get them to even acknowledge I was trying to joke around with them and get a posse to play. Then, I was about to start a song when my recruiter called my name. Ah, well. From 10-4 it was interviews. They were each an hour long, except for a “lunch” interview which lasted 1.5 hours. And I had 30 minutes to sort of pass out after lunch before the final two interviews. _Note to people looking for info on questions they ask in Microsoft interviews: don’t bother. I’ve noticed that a lot of people find my blog while they’re looking for interview questions to prepare for their own interviews. The thing that people don’t understand is that everyone asks different questions. And you don’t need to know the answers beforehand anyway. The whole point of the questions is that you answer them on the spot, and that the process of answering the question is what the interviewer wants to see. So if you knew the answer already, you might do worse in the interviewer’s eyes because they’d be like, “what the heck? This person doesn’t think!” Also, most of my questions were about me, so you’d have to do a lot of studying about Hung Truong if you wanted to ace my particular interview questions. The interviews themselves were thoughtful and pretty cool. The people interviewing me were really smart and all seemed like cool dudes to work with. I mean, as a self-respecting geek I know that Microsoft has a certain reputation for software. The thing is that a company as big as Microsoft will inevitably have great products and not-so-great products. Also, I read this article in Fast Company about Gary Flake , my new(est) role model! MS is finally entering the web space like they mean it and it’ll be interesting to see how they approach it and how it will affect the other big players (Google and Yahoo… to some extent). Finally, I had a chance to have dinner with a current MS employee. I chose my former classmate, Sameer . He and his wife took me to the Space Needle Restaurant, which was incredibly touristy and awesome. Oh, and expensive. Thanks for footing the bill, Microsoft! Seriously! I know that most of my job hunt posts end in some kind of failure post ( example 1 , example 2 , example 3 , example 4 , etc). I’ve gotten pretty used to rejection over the past few years. But! It seems I’ve gotten better at interviewing! For I got an offer! I can’t (and probably shouldn’t) disclose certain things, so let’s just leave it at that. I have about a week to make my decision. I will probably make another post when I do make a final decision. And then we’ll finally have a proper burial for my series of job hunt posts, once and for all (or at least hopefully for a while!)."

Not because I forgot, but because I happen to like Sonny Stitt. The songs are all pretty good. I think it’s parts of a live set that he did a while back. Stitt is just really freakin’ good, and not as repetitive as some people (Dexter Gordon, I’m looking at you!). My favorite part of this album is probably the cover art. Seriously, I think they looked through all pictures of Sonny Stitt and found the one where he looked baddest."

        "content": "There’s an instrumental version of this song by the Art Blakey Trio that I’ve liked for a while. One day, I don’t remember quite when, the random feature of iTunes played me the vocal version on the giant Clifford Brown collection I have. I like learning the words to songs, especially Jazz standards, so it was a surprise to me that the song actually had words: Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe Falling in love with love is playing the fool Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy Learning to trust is just for children in school I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full I was unwise with eyes unable to see I fell in love with love with love everlasting But love fell out with me What’s interesting is that there are two rhymes for each line. Like how ‘trust’ rhymes with ‘just’ and ‘fool’ rhymes with ‘school.’ It’s easier to do in this song since there’s only like, eight lines and most of the time they’re just rhyming ‘love’ with ‘love’ anyway. I like the idea of a song about falling in love with love. It’s meta! The only way to get more meta would be to write a song about this blog post about a song about falling in love with love! Someone should totally do this. At first, I thought the line was “caring too much is just a juvenile fantasy” because all the instrumental versions I’ve heard give that note extra “syllables.” I guess instrumentalists can take more liberties with the song than vocalists. Sometimes I think adding more “syllables” is a bad idea, but it works in this song (maybe because I heard it that way first). I started listening to a bunch of different versions of the song on Last.fm. The Sarah Vaughn version is pretty damn sweet!"

But did you know it can sorta make you sick!? It can. Apparently the process of makin’ antibodies can give you the side effect of fever and also making your arm (the one that is shot) sore. I was pretty much out of commission with a huge headache and general blah feeling on Friday evening. I was thinking about the flu shot. It doesn’t contain all of the flu strains; just the ones that “scientists” think will be around during flu season. So these “scientists” just pray that the flu strains they picked will be the ones that people will be inoculated with. This kinda doesn’t make sense to me. If a large portion of the population is immune against many different types of flu, wouldn’t that make less competition for a strain that isn’t in the flu shot to take control? It’s basically like giving one flu the monopoly on humans. I’m not sure it works that way, but it seems to make sense. I suppose there’s very few strains of flu so that makes it less likely that one flu would take over. Plus tons of people don’t get the shot anyway. I’m not an epidemiologist or anything, so don’t take my word for it! Either way, I hope I don’t get knocked on my ass by the flu like last year!"

Actually, someone should teach John a lesson in “Michigan Time,” being 10 minutes late for everything. As I got there, he was saying some random funny stuff about the guy who directed Hancock having two (!) copies of Frank Herbert’s Dune in his bag in an airplane. Wow. Then some Q&amp;A about voting machines and mole men. And he read some words. Out of the very book I was to purchase! A line formed for signing, and I kinda got there at the end because I thought I needed to grab a book for him to actually sign. I must’ve waited maybe an hour or two? Probably closer to two. When my moment came, I made sure to point out to John that I had corrected his spelling of Albuquerque , only to have him burn me by spelling it even more incorrectly . Then he wrote “Sorry about New Mexicoe” in my book. What a bastard! Just kidding. Apparently John counts the number of books he’s signed. He yelled the number of the next person in line to prompt them to approach. I’m #1165. I should also add that Hodgman was really nice. Very polite and receptive, even to crazed fans. I guess minor celebrity hasn’t gotten to his head yet. Except for the random ALL CAPS words he throws into his writing. THAT IS ALL. Oh, and about the picture, I dunno what happened. Maybe Hodgman is shrinking or I am entirely tall, or maybe he was just leaning over a bunch? It’s totally going to be my Christmas card!"

There’s 11 tracks but three are live, and there’s some duplication (live vs. studio, and acoustic). So I’d say there’s more than a single’s worth of stuff but not quite an album’s worth. Ingrid continues to do cool stuff with her awesome voice and funky phrasing. It’s pretty unique. Her actual songwriting seems a bit amateurish or at least good but not super great. I guess her style is lots of repetition, which doesn’t work when applied to every song. It’s like the “Green Eggs and Ham” of music. But that’s her style so that’s cool I guess. I also noticed that her style seems to be using more vibrato and running around with her voice. I’m not too impressed by it. It’s especially noticeable on “Over The Rainbow.” She can do cooler stuff with her voice than that, I think. Finally, I’m kind of disappointed that she’s not wearing glasses on the cover!!! As a glasses-girl lover I am appalled. Well, not really. But I went ahead and threw the album cover into that “virtual try on glasses” thing I used to pick my own glasses: Much better! Anyway, there’s some cool songs on here. Plus the proceeds of the CD go to standup2cancer.org which is nice. My favorite song is probably “Giving Up” (which doesn’t sound like it should be on a cancer fighting CD, but whatever). Also, I am pretty bummed that the tickets for the Ingrid Michaelson concert in Ann Arbor are already sold out! I guess she has a pretty solid fanbase here. Maybe she should book in Detroit or something. *Hint hint*. I already saw her last year but it’d be cool to see her again, especially before she gets uber famous (which should happen pretty soon)."

What weirds me out is that I was playing Pokemon before they were even born! Apparently there’s a lot more Pokemon around now. I know the original 151 and some of the ones after that, and I have Pokemon Diamond (or is it Pearl), but seriously, there’s too many for me to remember. My niece and nephew both have their own favorites. One likes the scary legendary ones (I told him they look scary and he disagreed), Palkia, Dialga and some other ones. And the other likes Togetic, the evolution of Togepi. Yes, I remembered that! Is it strange to have this much common ground with 8 and 6 year-olds? I guess it’s kind of cool, but sad at the same time. Pokemon is pretty freakin’ rad though, and I look forward to battling them at Christmas time when I see them. Bulbasaur, I choose you!"

        "content": "So I’m looking at jobs and stuff, and I’m also applying for something at Yahoo. Most employers’ job sites are pretty bad. I’m not sure why, but it seems that companies think that if the company is good enough, people will try to apply for jobs no matter how bad the actual process is. I’ve seen good implementations in the past as well as horrible ones. Google’s is actually not too bad (upload your resume and transcript, pdf is okay) while Yahoo’s is probably the worst. First off, when I talked to a recruiter from Yahoo at Michigan, I was told that as a “green” measure, Yahoo wasn’t taking paper resumes. Okay, that’s pretty cool, I guess. Power to the Purple. But then I attempted to actually apply online. The Yahoo careers site doesn’t take pdfs. It doesn’t take .pages either (which makes sense because those are actually directories!). So I convert the .pages to .doc and upload it. For some reason, the random filler stuff from the template (latin words, etc) makes it into the parser and pre-fills my resume with junk. Also, I found it very funny that the Yahoo resume parser thinks “Ann Arbor” is my name, and not my city! Another thing I noticed is that there’s a list of universities, but for some reason, it’s only the big ones. University of New Mexico is not on there. Luckily for me, I’m going to a big-name school now! There’s also a field for “Other University.” Way to make community college kids feel good, Yahoo. Finally, in order to get my resume in there, I have to copy and paste. That’s right, COPY AND PASTE. All the formatting I did to make my resume easy to read and cool-looking has gone down the drain. Getting resumes that are easy to read is apparently not important to Yahoo. You might think that I would hold my tongue since I’m applying at Yahoo. But seriously, the Yahoo Careers Site is horrible. It needs work. I’m sure Yahoo is a fine place for a career; I’m also sure that Yahoo would be happy that its (prospective) employees would call a spade a spade, and recognize when there’s a problem with the site. Who knows, I might even end up fixing the Careers site as my first gig at Yahoo. That is, if they’re willing to hire someone who can see problems and is not afraid to point them out."

Apparently SAX is 1337 when it comes to memory efficiency while DOM is incredibly inefficient. Seriously, Python was taking more than 1gb of memory to parse a 39mb file! Perhaps my actual use of the minidom stuff was incorrect, but either way, I’ll probably try doing stuff in SAX if the file happens to be even remotely big. Lesson learned!

Basically it’s crowdsourcing ideas for the best ways to help the most people, then $10 million dollars from Google goes to fulfilling those ideas. I put “contest” in quotation marks because the media seems to be portraying the thing as “submit a great idea and win $10 million!” But that’s not really the case at all. The “winners” of the process will win nothing (except “good karma” as Google explains) and the job of making the ideas into reality will go to some organization chosen through an RFP process. So really, the people who will benefit from the ideas (and whichever organizations get the $$$) are the real “winners.” I guess this process makes the most sense, but I have questions about how an organization would be chosen (it’d need to be done very fairly, non-biased to US-centric ideas, non-imperialistic in origin or intent). Also, where is the incentive, besides karma, for people to submit ideas? There’s something to be said about social entrepreneurism. If it’s really a great idea, others should be able to take that and do something really positive while also making money. If that’s the case, maybe Google can choose to fund startup companies that can execute the idea. I think that’d be a really cool angle to hold an actual “contest” of sorts. I’ve been thinking about what kind of submission I would send to Google. I think it’d be for: A non-evil search engine whose mission would be to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. One that doesn’t censor any of its results and doesn’t do business with governments that engage in censorship."

        "content": "Today and Yesterday were fun days since the engineering career fair was going on at north campus. Having started my own company (I’m the President!), I might not need to be looking at jobs this very moment. But I’m also looking at PhD programs and other stuff to do after I graduate, so I figured I should scope out the job scene as well. You’re already familiar with my past job hunting experiences, I wager. Or if you aren’t check out some posts here in the archives . I stuck to the engineering fair this time (there’s also a normal career fair going on at central campus). The experience seems to be more of the same for me this year. The thing I noticed is that there’s a large number of smaller, lesser-known companies who don’t have many people talking to them. Then there’s the big guys: MSFT, Apple, Intel who get huge ass lines of people waiting to talk. I kinda feel bad for the smaller guys, but don’t talk to them anyway since they seem pathetic. I mean that in a sympathetic way. I’m sure they’re great companies though. The first day, I went to talk to Microsoft, Apple, Expedia, Amazon and a few others. A brother of a friend did an internship at Microsoft, and so I have a higher opinion of them than I had before. They seem pretty into the whole student life thing. In the evening, they had this experimental tech fiesta thing. Basically a bunch of newer products with the people working on them, explaining how cool the stuff is. There was stuff like: Zune (the software, very cool), Startup Labs (which I am definitely applying to), Silverlight (which I’m still not convinced will be good) and a random dude playing Halo for what seemed like hours. Yeah, he basically just sat there the whole time. The startup labs thing seems to be a incubating thingy based in Cambridge. Way cool. Apple was pretty standard. I talked to them, explained I made a company that did iPhone apps, etc. They seemed to just want me to do an online resume or something. And this time I didn’t get a free song or any shwag at all! Amazon was probably the worst of them all. Every time I talk to people from Amazon, they just don’t get me. I wanted to talk about cool stuff, but they got wrapped up by testing my “engineerness.” Like, they asked me how I would sort a large array of numbers that wouldn’t fit into a single computer. “Well,” I said, “the answer you’re looking for is probably distributing the work to multiple computers and merging the lists back together after each computer is done with its share.” I seriously was just patronizing the person. Then they threw the “How do you find a loop in a linked list?” Actually, first they asked me if I knew what a linked list was. I wanted to say something like “DUDE, I HAVE A DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE! PLUS NO ONE USES LINKED LISTS IN REAL LIFE!” But basically I was happy to finally leave. Amazon might be a sweet company, but their recruiters blow hard. I also talked to a dude from Expedia who worked in their labs. He was really funny and really cool. I think he enjoys his job a lot. He was trying hard to see if there was a spot I could fill in the org, but it looks like their labs department is too small right now to hire on a random generalist. Which is kind of what I love to do. He was super cool though, seemed kind of crazy in a good way. I also noticed one of the most exorbitant career fair booths I have ever seen in my life. It’s the one in the picture at the top of this post. I should’ve taken more pics. I don’t know what ArcelorMittal does, but they can afford fucking plasmas in their brushed steel pagodas! It was like an experimental Ikea home or something, seriously! The second day of the career fair (today) was much quieter. I talked to Yahoo, imo.im and Arbor Networks. A classmate of mine did an internship at Yahoo this summer and turned me onto their stuff. The guy I talked to happened to be working in the mobile dept at Yahoo and dug my iPhone app that I demo’ed for him. But I said that I wanted to do more project lead stuff like product management. Unfortunately, it seems like business people do the PMing at Yahoo, which is totally different from most orgs. I think Microsoft and Google both hire PMs with engineering backgrounds. Anyway, the dude said to apply anyway and my resume could find its way into the right hands somehow. imo.im is the company I blogged about previously . They sent me a t-shirt! The recruiter, Marissa, remembered me and basically reiterated stuff from last time. I also did a raffle and ended up winning a shirt again. She’ll mail it to me. Honestly, imo.im seems like a pretty sweet startup gig, but the recruiter explained that they’re looking for extremely talented coders and algorithmers. I imagine the interview process would be grueling. It makes sense, though, since they’re a startup and need to have as much manpower for their size as possible. Arbor Networks is a network security company here in town. I talked to the guy, thanking them for giving me a shirt the last time I talked to them. I didn’t think there’d be much overlap between my interests and theirs, but we started talking about network visualizations. I wonder if we were on the same page. Either way, I’ll check out their company again since their recruiters seem cool. Finally, Facebook had an info session tonight. The dude who interviewed me last year was here again. This time the presentation seemed really too technical and boring versus the one last year which was more fun and about the company itself. They gave a lot of code examples, but I’ve developed FB apps before so it was old news to me. I’d be more interested in hearing about FB’s future plans, but I doubt they would reveal stuff like that. Last year I had interviewed for an engineering gig. I think I was a bit too rusty for that. This time, I hope I can prove my worth in more than just coding, but in analysis, business stuff, and creativity too. Overall, the career fair was pretty fun. It’s too bad that some recruiters are completely clueless, but the good ones are really good. It seems a bit silly sometimes for recruiters to show up all the way in Ann Arbor just to say “email us your resume,” but I guess the impression is what counts."

They probably have no say in whether or not their game gets DRM slapped on it, so it’s punishing them for something out of their control. DRM sucks, but I dunno if it’s “okay” to act like a baby and give the game 1 star if it’s really better than that. But hey, I haven’t played it so maybe it really sucks. Probably has to do with the years(!) of hype the game got that couldn’t possibly be followed through in the end. In other video game news, I got Disgaea 3 and have been playing that for a bit. It’s pretty much the same as Disgaea 1-2 but it’s still fun. I’m a bit dissapointed that the vector graphics are still pretty low res. If it’s the PS3 I’d like to see at least a few more pixels on those characters. 3D would probably ruin the game, but higher res would be very much appreciated. I also got Resident Evil 4 for the Wii but haven’t played it yet. Too scared of dogs jumping through the window like in the first one… Fuck that was scary!"

You can see it here (it should have this post on it by the time you can read this, too). The initial release is really barebones and somewhat crappy. There’s no commenting system (it just tells you to add one). I like the way that the system formats images within imported blog posts, but everything else seems like an afterthought. The Twitter imports had a picture of some random Asian dude before I changed it to my own picture. Why not use the Twitter user image? Also, when you click through to a blog post, all of the text just pops out, unformatted. It turns everything into one long paragraph. I’m all about paragraph breaks. Besides a few supported feeds, Sweetcron kinda just imports RSS generically. Like my delicious bookmarks don’t have anything special. Just the text and a link to the bookmark. At the very least, Sweetcron should have support for all of the things that FriendFeed does. And by support, I mean it should intelligently handle any categorization and formatting of the content. I guess Sweetcron is strictly for the hardcore such as myself, but I was hoping it’d have a little more going for it upon its first release."

I wanted some thicker frames this time around but the plastic ones I tried on didn’t feel too great. So I ended up getting a pair of metal full frame glasses that are sorta dark green and have this weird temple design. The lady at the eye place was really cool and helped me try on a bunch of frames. Many of them looked kind of girly or totally bad for my face. The lady definitely knew what was up with what worked and what didn’t. Unfortunately, the frames that I really liked cost a lot and weren’t included in my vision plan. I dunno if this was her ulterior motive or if she was just picking from all the stuff equally. She probably has some kind of incentive to pick more expensive frames; but she did suggest only the ones that I agreed looked good. Anyway, it went between two good frames but the green ones won in the end. If I can’t get a green DS or a green Wii, at least I can get green glasses. They should be ready in a few weeks. I’ll just pick them up right when school starts since I’ll be out of town for a while in the next few weeks. As a bonus, here are some funky frames I found that didn’t make the cut (but I didn’t bother taking pictures of the actual frames I ordered, whoops!):"

        "content": "A few weeks ago, I saw that SXSW Interactive was accepting applications for panel ideas. I’ve been playing a lot with analyzing social networks and network structure in and out of my coursework at the University of Michigan, so I wrote a panel proposal for a walkthrough of network theory and how it’s relevant and useful to companies and products that have some kind of social component. My general motivation for proposing this is that I’m sure that a lot of companies have some really interesting network data about their users that isn’t being put to good use. Sure, a company like Microsoft or Yahoo will have their own research labs ( this paper from Yahoo Research about the evolution of social networks is totally awesome), but smaller companies will most likely lack the resources and skills to do interesting network analysis. Hopefully my presentation will serve as a good starting point for people with access to rich network data to produce some really interesting data and maybe even share it. This kind of data is usually difficult to get access to, so it’s kind of a shame if the data exists and isn’t being used. Anyway, check out my official submission here . It’d be cool if I could get some supporters to vote and comment on the thing, but I guess that might become kind of spammy as well. I also checked out a bunch of the proposals on the SXSW Panel Picker. Here’s a few I think look interesting: Ruby Sinreich , Understanding Social Networks, Beyond the Graph – This one seems probably the most similar to mine, so it makes sense that it looks really interesting to me. It looks like rather than focusing on theory, this panel will be more practical in nature. Mussie Shore , Bustin’ Social out of the Network – This one looks neat mainly because the speaker founded a mobile software company that was acquired by Google and now works on OpenSocial. Plus there’s a ton of positive comments already (wonder if he’s got his possee on this). ian nieves , Discovery: The Future of Friend Search – Searching people is a problem that I’ve always had an interest in. Using network centrality measure makes sense to rank which people come up in a search. I’m interested in seeing what kind of algorithm this guy is using for friend search. Russ Unger , Friendship is Dead – I just love the idea of this panel. The fact that people aren’t really people anymore; they’re just items to collect in Facebook. Kind of like Pokemon. I haven’t gotten through all the panels but I’m hoping to skim through all the sections I might find interesting. Hopefully my idea will be interesting enough to be selected. Remember, sign up for a SXSW account, check out the Panel Picker , and vote for stuff (including me )!"

        "content": "After Life (also called “Wonderful Life” in Japanese) is a film about what happens when you die. I’ve been wanting to watch this movie recently because a few people close to me have passed away in the last year. I was originally introduced to this film a few years ago in Japanese class by a classmate who was a philosophy grad student. After Life has a somewhat positive view on the afterlife, so I thought it’d be nice to watch. The film’s afterlife is actually really similar to the world as we know it. Seasons change, electricity goes out and people get cold when it snows. The difference is that new visitors to the afterlife have a week to choose their most precious (大切な!) memory to immortalize in film form. Apparently they’ll watch their memory and then go on to yet another afterlife where they keep only that memory with them. The idea is both liberating and excruciating at the same time. You can forget all the bad things that happened in life and cling onto one great memory. But you also have to leave all of your life’s work and focus on the one most important moment of your life. The film works in sort of a pseudo-documentary/narrative mode where the dead counselors help the newly departed choose their memories. What follows is a candid look at the lives of 10 or so people. Some won’t stop talking about their womanizing ways while others think it would be cool to choose Splash Mountain. Apparently a lot of high school girls pick Splash Mountain. In the midst of all this, there’s also a plotline concerning the relationship between two of the counselors. It turns out the counselors are dead, too. They’re all people who weren’t able to choose a memory. There’s a love story of sorts going on between them which kind of begs the question: why doesn’t everyone just choose to stay in the limbo afterlife instead of making a movie memory? They could literally live forever. Maybe people living in the limbo eventually fall out of love or get bored and decide to end it? I could imagine a number of Hamlet-style soliloquies proposing “to choose or not to choose?” One of the recently dead, a young punk, starts messing with the counselors. He asks if he can use a dream as his memory, or even just make stuff up. He’s sort of the voice of reason in the movie. He asks the questions that I’d ask and prys much more than the other deceased. While watching I realized that the actor was also Morita in Honey &amp; Clover , another Japanese movie I recently watched. Apparently he’s also in Casshern! After all of the dead people choose their memories, the counselors get to work making their memories into mini-movies. After Life works because of its absolute earnestness. It really seems like a true documentary where these people are choosing their ultimate fates. They seem completely genuine when they’re describing the happiest moments of their lives and genuinely happy to see those moments recreated on set with actors portraying them. It probably helps that the director did a lot of actual documentaries before working on this movie. After Life is a great movie because it successfully suspends disbelief. For the 118 minutes of the film, I’m convinced that when you die, you make a movie about your life, watch it, and relive that memory forever. That alone is wonderful, given our uncertainty of the afterlife while we’re still living. So yeah, that’s what I have to say about After Life. It’s quirky, funny, thoughtful and genuine. I really dig it."

I really have no idea how the bat got in, since the only windows open were the ones with screens. Maybe the bat squeezed through one? Or maybe it was a lame assassination attempt? We may never know the truth!"

But there was so much hype leading up to it that the movie was kind of wasted. My co-workers were really psyched about the movie. So listening to them continuously talk up the movie had its effect on me, I guess. If I had come in with no expectations, the movie would’ve been incredible. It still was, and it met the hype, but sometimes I feel the best way to go into a movie is with no expectations at all. When I went to see Wall-e a few weeks ago (or maybe it was just last week), I had no idea what the movie was about. Okay, so I knew it had a robot in it. And that was about it. I ended up enjoying it a lot! I think we, as viewers, should just let the damn story tell itself. No spoilers, no trailers, maybe just a title. Knowing as little as possible about a movie going into it probably gives the best chance for me to enjoy it."

        "content": "So early last night, I noticed that one of my sites, Anime Nano, was flipping out and throwing 502 proxy errors. I tried to do some simple troubleshooting but it seems as though the problem came very suddenly, and I figured it might go away very suddenly as well. The thing about this particular problem was that I had made no changes to the server. So the problem should fix itself! Unfortunately, life is not so simple. When I woke up in the morning, not only was the site still throwing errors, it was also affecting my other websites as well. MapsKrieg, Notecentric, Basugasubakuhatsu, etc. So I figured I should find out what is going on. I sent a support request to MediaTemple, my host, in case it might’ve been something on their end. It took a while for them to reply, but they eventually just told me it was something taking up all the memory and that I should try to optimize the site. Not too helpful. But I don’t really expect MediaTemple to provide this kind of support anyway. And it turned out it wasn’t their fault. Upon closer inspection, the site was really behaving weird. I could tell by the logs that the site was actually rendering things, but it always took about 189 seconds. This was odd. I’ve had experiences before where the rendering took less than a second but the page still took more than 3 seconds to load. But 189 seconds! That was a bit too much. I had suspected it was something to do with the mongrel cluster that I had set the site up to run on. Basically, I followed the script that MediaTemple provided and I still don’t have a great understanding of how mongrel cluster works. That’s definitely bad. I tried stripping the view of everything but the content for layout. I got rid of before_filters and tried running the site on the mongrel clusters as well as the webrick server on port 3000. The same thing happened. It took way too long for the site to load. Thinking it might be easier to test on my local machine, I got the site and database from svn and mysql and, strangely, it worked fine on my PC. Now things were slowly fitting together. I was reminded of a post that someone made on Anime Nano about how their feed wasn’t being aggregated into the site. Apparently their feed was unreachable from my server. I had previously chalked this up to weirdness on their server, but I wondered if it wasn’t a problem on my server. The thing about each pageload taking almost exactly 189 seconds pointed to a timeout issue. Then I realized there was a piece of code in Anime Nano that I hadn’t written. It was a plugin for Text Link Ads that I used for some ads on the bottom of the site. That plugin was grabbing a feed of ads and parsing it to show links automatically on the site. If their site was unreachable, it’s possible that Anime Nano was just waiting on grabbing that snippet of code and timing out. And that’s exactly what happened. I commented out the text for the ads and the site immediately started working again. I’ll have to look into how I can prevent this from happening again before reinstating the ads. So what did I learn from this whole experience? You should probably understand how code works before randomly integrating it into your site (I added that code a long, long time ago and forgot about it). Also, relying on a third party to provide some information before loading your site is just plain stupid. I can’t believe how badly thought out I had made the organization of the site."

        "content": "So I’ve been playing Wii Fit for a while. One of the really neat things about the program (it’s not really a game, right?) is that it automagically graphs your progress as you lose weight. It’s pretty nice getting positive feedback when you put hard work into something. I think this is one of the very well thought-out features of Wii Fit. Anyway, I was looking at my weight going down and figured I’d do some rudimentary linear regression on it. I’m pretty much just eyeballing it because I don’t want to throw stuff into R or Matlab. It seems as though I’ll reach a threshold (away from Obesity) around the end of August. Though I’m basing this on a linear fit. It’s possible that the actual plot will end up looking more like a power law since it’s easier to lose weight when you’re way overweight. The point is, I’m losing weight and it’s nice to try and see when I might reach my goals. I also think it’s worth noting that Wii Fit seems to overestimate my weight. Because when I use my bathroom scale my weight is always lower than what Wii Fit says. I guess I could adjust the “weight of clothing” but since I always pick the same thing I don’t want to mess with the consistency. Now, if Nintendo had programmed some regression in automatically, I’d have to give it a 10/10 for science! But for now I’m pretty happy with just the graph functionality. It’s fun seeing large local fluctuations with a general downward trend. Now, if I can only keep this graph from turning into a parabola like with my DDR Diet…"

But finally, I have a neat iPhone 3G that does cool stuff. It started this morning at around 5:30. I woke up (though I only got like, 3 hours of sleep since I had taken a nap earlier and messed up my sleep cycle) and took a quick shower. No breakfast. Just took a vitamin water (these things are kinda good!) and a coffee granola bar for energy. Gaurav (from Troubadour Mobile ) picked Adam (also from Troubadour Mobile ) and I up. We drove to the mall and saw a bunch of peeps. We also saw some officemates from CampusRoost (yes, that’s a slick mention!). They told us that the AT&amp;T store on Liberty had like, zero people and we should go there. When we actually got to the AT&amp;T store, it was around 6:30ish. There were actually about 30 people in line. Apparently everyone showed up around 6:15 or so. There was a really cool line wrangler named Steve that kept everyone reasonably informed. We found out there were like, 40 phones. So we should be able to get one. Adam and Brent didn’t want to settle for white ones. Or 8GB ones. But I think eventually Adam got a black 8GB and I dunno what Brent did. At 8am, the line started moving, and it was moving well. But then disaster struck! It seems either Apple or AT&amp;T didn’t have the resources to take a billion people in the US all wanting iPhones at the same time (and having to activate them in the store). The activations were apparently taking around 45-50 minutes each when they should’ve taken 15 or so. Eventually, the AT&amp;T people let us just do most of the steps in store and then activate at home. By the time we were done, it was about 11am. I went home and tried to activate the thing for about 15 minutes. iTunes was just being bad. So I went to sleep. I woke up at around 2pm and tried to activate again. This time it worked after about 30 minutes of trying. I’ve been loading up apps and trying them out. It’s pretty cool. My favorite so far is the PhoneSaber."

Geez, Bubble Man was so awesome! It’s amazing that Capcom is actually making a new Mega Man game with NES style graphics. I think the only reason this is possible is that digital distribution (Wii Shop channel, PS3 Store, Xbox Live) makes it extremely cheap to distribute. I imagine an 8-bit game costs less to develop than, say, Grand Theft Auto 4. So Capcom should be able to make its money back through nostalgic fans. I, for one, will probably be getting it. Depending on my level of nostalgia vs. the price of the thing. I remember the NES Mega Man series kind of jumping the shark anyway, when they started running out of “Men” to use. Seriously, Pharaoh Man? CLOWN MAN!? I hope the bosses are a bit more original and kickass this time around."

Anyway, the shirt colors fit the UNM colors. Pretty sweet! Now fast forward to… now. I’m at the University of Michigan, and our colors are “Blue” and “Maize.” Our sworn enemy, Ohio State, has the colors of “Scarlet” and “Gray.” Which is basically the same as my old school’s colors. Kind of hard to disassociate with. Anyway, I’ve noticed that while walking around with my red Google shirt on, people seem to give me more dirty looks (than usual). Like I was at Meijer last week and I could’ve sworn I noticed some hostility. I figured the Google shirt (remember, imagine the cup above as a shirt) reminds them of the Ohio State shirt: That might just be my crazy theory, but I think it works. I’m sure from a far enough distance, the red Google shirt could look like the Ohio State shirt. And I’ve given my fair share of dirty looks to people wearing Ohio State stuff in Ann Arbor. How dare they, right? I think it’s time I get a blue and maize Google shirt. What say you, Google?"

        "content": "So I’ve been playing Wii Fit for a while, and I’ve noticed some weird stuff happen. For example, some days I’ll just get the male trainer (I typically like the female trainer) and he’ll say something like “Hey there, I’ll be your trainer for today” but he goes away after one exercise. Also, my normal trainer will just say random stuff sometimes, like she’ll act sleepy and talk about how she didn’t get enough sleep last night. Hey trainer, let’s try to keep it professional, huh? I don’t want to know about your personal life. Another random thing I noticed was that my playing time would just randomly reset sometimes. I finally figured out what was going on last night. It turns out that Wii Fit just counts the minutes you work out per day. So since I was playing late last night, the time reset. I think it would make more sense to count minutes on a per session basis, but whatever. The whole midnight cutoff thing works too, I guess. Finally, I noticed that my trainer’s hairstyle changed! It’s in a short ponytail now: Before it was sort of a short hairstyle. Don’t ask me why I noticed this. Let’s just say it was only about last week that I noticed she didn’t actually move her lips. I’m not usually staring at her lips… Previously I thought it would be cool if you could “dress up” your trainer. I guess that’s kind of a uniquely Japanese thing that culturally people might want to do. I guess it’s cool if the trainer just has a mind of their own as well. I think that the outfit for the female trainer might’ve gotten a bit more conservative. It looks like in the old Wii Fit commercials she’s wearing a shorter top (and showing more tummy) as seen here: Anyway, I should probably be paying less attention to the actual trainer and more attention to working out. Which is working pretty well for me, actually."

Investigators said that the charge could be upgraded to intoxication manslaughter depending on the outcome of toxicology tests. Officers at the accident scene Sunday said Truong was nonchalant and at times laughing as if he were impaired by drugs or alcohol, or had a severe mental deficiency. C’mon, other Hung Truong! You’re giving Hung Truongs like me a bad name! Also, I happen to be 25 now, so there shouldn’t be any confusion as to which Hung Truong is the “bad” one! Perusing Google News, I also dug up this recent story about a Canadian Hung Truong : Hung Truong, 39, of Markham, faces charges of arson endangering life and production of a controlled substance. Seriously now! Aren’t there any other good Hung Truongs (besides me, of course) around to spread the good name(s) of Hung Truong!? I got us that WSJ article , but how much more can one Hung Truong do!? Also, this sorta reminds me of a time way back, when a Google search for Hung Truong brought up this news article : Last week, women from 13 different rooms told police a stranger entered their rooms while they were asleep early Sunday morning. Six women said the man climbed on them, pulled off their clothes or fondled them. Man, I’m glad I upped my Google PageRank !

But I pretty much didn’t get anything else done. I don’t care what anyone says; old school 2D D&amp;D games like Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale and Torment rock. They’re just too damn fun to play. I don’t know what it is. Maybe it’s how your enemies explode into chunks if you hit them hard enough. Maybe it’s how Magic Missile grows more powerful as you gain levels. Maybe it’s the actual role-playing. But once I start one of these old school adventures I can’t stop until hunger or weariness takes priority. Which is just about to happen. But I thought I’d blog about it first. (I guess Baldur’s Gate is then a sort of offline equivalent of World of Warcraft, which I never really got myself dependent on, thank god) I tried playing Mass Effect kind of recently. It just doesn’t have the same fun factor. I mean, what kind of RPG expects me to actually aim a gun? The KOTOR games at least handled all the blaster shots and stuff. Why does everything have to degenerate into FPS? Oh well. I still never beat any of the Baldur’s Gate or Icewind Dale games (or Torment) so I guess if I ever run into a period where I have a lot of free time (probably will never happen) I’ll have plenty of things to do. P.S. This time I rolled a Half-Elf Chaotic Good multi-classed Fighter/Cleric. Usually I go for the Ranger but I found they kind of suck. A vanilla Fighter would be too boring so I multiclassed!

While it was pretty cool and definitely displayed all the neat stuff you can do with the PS3, I felt like it was getting out of “MGS” territory. Metal Gear is supposed to be sneaking around and grabbing people, snapping their necks and stealing stuff from them. It’s about shooting their heads with so many tranquilizer darts that they look like the dude from Hellraiser. Basically, I think the Metal Gear Solid franchise peaked at around the end of the boat part of Metal Gear Solid 2. Don’t get me wrong, Metal Gear Solid 3 was also good. But it just felt like the series has been losing its original focus and going after too much, especially with the whole behind the back camera thing. Also, in terms of story continuity, the Metal Gear series has just gotten insane. I “sort of” understood what was going on after Metal Gear Solid 1. But after the insanity of #2 (with the entire game flipping out at the end when you find out you’re really just in a simulation or something) and the prequel hijinks of #3, it’s too much to handle and tie up in the final 4th iteration. There’s a downloadable encyclopedia that you can get on the PS3, but that thing would take forever to load! I agree with the Beta-Waffle gu y that the boss battles seemed a bit contrived. In all the other games, you’re taking down an elite force of bad guys and you know you’re gonna fight them at some point. Remember in MGS1 when you were wondering exactly where Decoy Octopus was? In MGS4, you just kind of know that you have to fight these B&amp;B chicks. And they don’t really have a back story until you’ve finished fighting them. And their back stories are dumb anyway. The bosses just turned out to be really generic and more tedious than anything. Finally, I just couldn’t get used to the controls. They’re so messed up! You have to press R1 to aim, and R2 to shoot, but you need to press triangle to get to first person mode. When you’re in first person mode, you have about 0 mobility. So if a guy finds you and you need to shoot him, you go through a crazy set of button presses that will probably end up failing because he’ll shoot you first and you’ll just fall down. The controls just don’t work for the kind of FPS fighting that’s expected in some points. Having complained quite a bit, MGS4 still is a pretty neat achievement. The graphics are great. The story is epic (but makes no sense). There’s lots of inside jokes referring to previous MGSes. But just like in the game itself, it looks like Snake’s job here is done. It’s time for him to take a vacation. At least we’ll always have the continue screen yelling. “Snake, what’s wrong? Snake? Can you hear me? SNAAAAAKKKKEEEEEEE!”"

I need some eye candy while I exercise, not some dude! Also, one day I got all the way through my workout and went to do the plank thing. After doing the plank thing my time reset to :01 minutes. It basically erased all of the previous things I had done. Not that it really matters. It didn’t erase the calories I burned (OR DID IT!). As far as my health goes, I have lost a few pounds since starting, but not enough to reach my goal in time. So the game let me readjust my goal. I think previously I was trying to lose 5 lbs a week or something, which is kind of difficult. I’ve also noticed a marked improvement in my strength. All those push-ups and stuff paid off. Which is to say I can actually do some push-ups now when before I just collapsed under the weight of my torso. My posture is probably improving as well. So anyway, I think the fact that I have stuck with the Wii Fit stuff for a whole month is probably some kind of achievement. Maybe I’ll celebrate by eating a whole tub of ice cream.

It’d be cool if new exercises were to show up as downloadable content or something. I’ve been feeling pretty good lately as well. Besides the major pain factor of the “plank” exercise, most of the stuff isn’t too bad. I think I’ve already been building muscle, and now the actual weight loss might begin to show. I’m also trying to eat less. “Normal” portions in the US are way too big, so I’ve been trying to get small stuff for lunch and share things when possible. It seems to be having a positive effect. I also seem to be more flexible during the yoga stuff. Who knows if I’m doing it right, but the Tree thing is a lot easier for me to do (and my foot actually can go up that high now). I’d like to get a Wii and Wii Fit for my parents since they’d probably enjoy doing the exercises and could probably use the exercise themselves. Too bad it costs a bunch and the equipment is still in high demand and short supply. Overall I’d say the product is pretty sweet, and if you have enough self-motivation paired with the game’s motivation (it says stuff like, “I see you were too busy to exercise last night…” when you miss a day) you can easily live a healthier lifestyle."

Okay, it’s not really in honor of my birthday; I’m just doing it because I have some free time today. Anyway, one of the things that Anime Nano needs to do is run a crontab of a function from a Rails model using a crontab. If that made no sense to you, don’t worry. Just enjoy the pretty picture of the rails logo above. If that made sense to you, wow, you’re pretty hardcore. This is something that I remember spending time getting to work the last time I set up my server. But unfortunately I didn’t write about how I did it, so I had to spend an hour or so figuring it out again. Apparently, crontab runs in a different environment than the root user. If you try to run a script for Ruby using “ruby script/runner” you’ll just get nothing. No error message, just nothing. I did something on the previous server that set the crontab environment, but I have no idea what I did. I searched. I didn’t find the answer. So what I ended up doing (this is for future Hung when he has to eventually move his sites to an even newer server) is sticking some lines for my environment into the crontab itself. I just ran ‘env’ and got a bunch of stuff. Comparing the ‘env’ command run from the crontab itself (I just piped the output to a random text file) and running in my shell, I saw a few differences. Most notably these ones: GEM_HOME=/usr/local/rubygems/gems GEM_PATH=/usr/local/rubygems/gems RUBYLIB=/usr/local/rubygems/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8 And voila, my crontabbed rails script/runner model script thing ran. Hopefully writing this post will save me some time in the future. Oh, and happy birthday to me."

        "content": "The weekend is here, and I’m trying to use my “free” time as effectively as possible. I just finished a book that I borrowed form the library, Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age by Duncan Watts. The book is basically an overview of the evolution of Network Science, the thing I’m studying in grad school. I’m technically specializing in “Social Computing,” which includes the study of stuff like complex systems, graph theory, sociology, etc. Since it’s a relatively new (or recently popular) field, there’s a lot of overlap with other fields. And as described in the book, it is very interdisciplinary. Much of the book covers things I studied in SI 508: Networks. But in the sense that Six Degrees is more of a historical recollection than a textbook, there was quite a lot to take in. For example, Watts starts by describing previous attempts to map out social networks at a time when computing power was non-existent. The complexity of the problems ensured that the researchers could only dream of solving their problems until the next generation of scientists (and computers) arrived. The book then follows a fairly linear path from the study of random networks to small-world networks to scale free networks. Then we get to read about network dynamics: epidemics, cascades, percolation. Finally there’s a neat section about multi-scale networks and complex systems that exist in our everyday lives. There are a few recurring themes in Six Degrees that I noticed. First is that physicists seem to be spoken very highly of (possibly because Duncan Watts is a physicist?). If you ask me, Computer Scientists are actually pretty good at solving problems, too… Secondly, there is a common “critical threshold” that systems can pass. A sort of on/off switch that determines whether a network is a small-world or whether a musician enjoys platinum success. Another is that innovation really occurs when people with differing backgrounds and ideas work together. That last one is something I really want to stay aware of as the school I’m currently attending has a great number of smart people, all with their own unique interests and projects. I felt a certain sense of appropriateness while reading a book entitled “Six Degrees.” While I don’t know Duncan Watts directly, quite a few people I do know were referenced in the book, either in the actual narrative or the bibliography. Cris Moore, a researcher at the Santa Fe institute was my professor at UNM for one of my algorithms classes. For that class, I did experiments with random graphs, determining at which average degree distribution the “giant component” emerged (which is possibly why I went down the path to study social networks, eventually). Lada Adamic is also referenced a bit briefly in the book. She was the professor for that aforementioned Networks class that I took last Fall. I’ve also taken another class with her and she’s been advising me quite a bit on what direction to go with my studies. Mark Newman, who I haven’t worked directly with but who works directly down the hall from the School of Information has a fairly huge role in the book as well. Perhaps it’s the fact that I’m studying networks for school, or maybe it’s that the group of people studying networks is very tightly knit, but I still think it’s pretty awesome whenever I see someone I know mentioned by name in a book! By my calculations, my “Watts number” is at least three since I am a student of Lada who works with Mark who worked directly with Watts. Or equivalently, I was a student of Cris who worked with Mark who worked with Watts. It might actually be two, but since there’s a level of uncertainty in this particular social network, I’d have to ask around to find out. I guess I could just walk up to Mark Newman at school one day and shake his hand to bring it down to two for certain. Maybe one day I can bring it down to one (I actually convinced Lada to hand Watts my resume at a conference they were both attending!). Throughout the book, I’ve gotten several ideas on how I could do further research on the datasets that I’ve gathered over the past few semesters. I think the biggest challenges might actually be working them into my coursework since I’m not quite a research track student. Specifically, I haven’t probed far enough with dynamic networks, especially in the context of contagion in things like the spread of Facebook App installation. I’m sure there’s a ton of other things I can do with the data I have; I just don’t know what would be most interesting, or interesting at all. It’s probably just the perspective of the book, but Six Degrees makes it seem like Duncan Watts was behind all of the breakthroughs in network science for the past 10 years or so. Seriously, it reads like Watts is the Superman of network analysis. The fact that he knows his own experiences better than anyone else’s is most likely the reason for this (I could write a lot about what I did, but not as much about what anyone else has done). But still, I bet Watts is a network beast in real life! Anyway, if you’re interested in studying social networks or networks in general, I highly recommend this book. Duncan Watts has a way of writing for ordinary people. Actually, I’m not sure if this book is entirely accessible since I already had a semester of network theory under my belt before reading it. But I have a feeling it’s very readable. In the end, Watts concedes that the science of networks is still in its infancy. I think this represents a very cool opportunity, and hopefully I can contribute to the work that’s already been done so far. Man, I’m totally pumped right now! Another book I’ve been meaning to read is “ Nexus .” Hopefully that one’s available at the library when I go to return Six Degrees."

        "content": "I was browsing around Facebook today when I thought of checking the network pages for my universities. Network pages are interesting because you can see stuff that’s popular in your particular network. While the Network pages seem to be rarely used, I still think they’re interesting to have around. For example, here’s the statistics page for Michigan as of right now: I found it really difficult to find the network page today. In fact, I had to go to google and query for “facebook networks” to actually find the networks page. This is because Facebook is apparently discontinuing the network pages. Now is a good time for me to ask, “WTF!?” Social networks are interesting because they have multiple variables. People know each other through networks, especially by regional and work networks. By removing network pages, Facebook is losing a pretty important source of info. I understand they’re not removing actual networks; just their pages. But still, why bother getting rid of something? They aren’t really being used, but I still like to check them now and then to get a quick overview of what’s happening. Recently, Facebook seems to be closer and closer to jumping that proverbial shark. Not just because of this change, but because of changes to the developer platform as well. It’s gotten to the point where one cannot casually write applications for Facebook because the functions they use will surely become deprecated within months. Can you imagine that happening on a real OS? Combine the “alpha” hijinks of the platform with the fact that no meaningful income is being made on the apps, and you have a formula for slow, rotting death of applications! Will the next Facebook please stand up?"

        "url": "/blog/2008/05/29/wii-fit-mini-review/",
        "content": "I pre-ordered Wii Fit from Amazon.com and got it a few days ago, on Friday, I believe. That was probably a good idea, since it seems there’s a Wii Fit shortage of sorts going around (in addition to the shortage of Wiis themselves). I saw them going for pretty inflated prices on the Amazon Marketplace. I wonder if they’re actually selling for that much. Wii Fit comes with a neat balance board and a “game.” I put “game” in quotations because it’s really debatable if it’s a game or not. The balance board is sort of a scale, balance sensor and exercise step all in one. Wii Fit (the game) is a collection of stuff that more or less fits in four categories: Yoga Poses Strength Training Aerobic Stuff Balance Games The game starts out by giving you a really hippie-esque lecture about how balance is really important for you body. Like, the kind of balance where you don’t fall over and you put equal weight on your feet. I guess I never thought much about it, but I did the test and had some pretty interesting balance issues. My right foot seems to be pretty darn prominent. The board also tells me I’m obese! NOOO! I lost a lot of weight playing DDR but since grad school started I’ve gained it back and then some. So I’m making a resolution of sorts to lose some weight. This is where Wii Fit actually does pretty well. First off I’ll say that the Yoga and Strength Training parts have a trainer that you can pick. Male or Female. The trainer does examples of the moves before you do them, then you see them do it as you’re doing it. Being a male, I chose the female trainer. I think this is probably what most people do. They pick the opposite sex because it’s more motivating. The female training avatar chick is kind of okay looking, but I think it would be cool if you could “customize” the experience. That’s all I’ll say about that. The yoga stuff probably won’t help burn much fat and stuff, but it is good for working on balance. I just finished unlocking all the yoga things (today is my 6th day on Wii Fit). The last one is pretty crazy, but many of them are doable. I can do that one that the lady is doing on the box art (the tree) even though it looks kind of insane. At the very least the yoga stuff is good for mellowing out and breathing (which I learned to do pretty well being a brass instrument player, but probably suck quite a bit at now). The strength training is probably the best part of the game to get fit. I should note that Wii Fit is probably the most painful game I’ve played since the original NES system (and its blister-inducing controller). Like, I’m in a lot of pain for much of the exercises. Especially the push ups (which are really hard for me) and the plank, which is basically torture for fat people. It even sounds like a torture device! In the 6 days I’ve been doing it, I think I actually am getting better. Imagine that, a game that gets easier each time you play it. The Aerobic stuff is kind of fun. There’s this weird hula hoop thing. It’s a little weird. Also, there this thing where you just run in place for a while. This wouldn’t be fun, except you get to see your Mii guy run around the island. It still isn’t really that fun, but it’s more fun than staring at the wall and running in place. I bet running outside would be even better though. The balance games are sort of fun, too. The skiing one is very fun, and there’s also a snowboard one (which you do sideways). There’s also a zen thing where you sit on the board and stay as still as possible. Sounds like the luge or something! Overall, Wii Fit is great because it provides so much feedback. When you do something right, the avatar tells you that you did a good job. If you screw up, they’re not too hard on you. But you get an actual number to show how well you did and you can keep track of that number. That’s definitely an incentive to keep trying and improve on stuff you’ve done in the past. When you weigh yourself, you get a history of your weight and you can actually see it getting closer (or farther) to the goal! I think the biggest thing keeping people from exercising is probably motivation. The game gives you a good, personal motivation to keep trying to reach your goal. It does a good job of not sounding too preachy, but also telling it to you like it is. I’m not sure how long I’ll stick with it, but for now I would like to continue until I reach my goal of having a “normal” BMI."

I figured this movie would be pretty good since the Napoleon Dynamite guy directed it and Jack Black stars in it. I have to agree with Ebert . The movie just isn’t that great. Or rather, it doesn’t reach the potential that it obviously has. There are so many untied loose ends that at the end of the movie, I was really sure there had to be more. What about the skinny guy’s relationship with the fat woman? What about the skinny guy’s love of science, and not God? Wasn’t Nacho supposed to convert him or something? And wasn’t Nacho going to get married to the hot nun (who I thought was Penelope Cruz through the entire movie but is apparently a different actress)? None of the characters were really fleshed out that well. The hot nun was just sort of a token hot nun who just looked confused for most of the movie. The skinny dude sort of became a companion to Nacho, but his character really didn’t go anywhere either. I think part of the problem is that you lose a lot of Jack Black’s funniness when he has to use a fake Mexican accent. Instead of talking like Jack Black, he just does a lame impression of a Mexican dude. It’s like they put really heavy ankle weights on Jack Black’s comedy ankles and they never took them off! Except maybe for the scene where he sang. That was pretty funny. Also, the movie was a “Nickelodeon” production, which explained the lack of cruder humor and the abundance of fart noises."

Previous comparisons have been throwing out things like “what does an orange taste like?” or “what is the capital of New Zealand?” No one asks those kinds of questions. Therefore, I will just search “who is Hung Truong?” since I’m sure lots of people want to know. It’s probably the most popular search term of all time, really. The Google search does pretty well. 6/10 links on the first page are actually attributable to me, Hung Truong (the most popular Hung Truong on Google today!). Hmmm… Powerset just returns a bunch of stuff from Wikipedia. Unfortunately, I don’t have a Wikipedia article (yet)! 0/10 of the first 10 results are actually about me. So there you have it.

        "url": "/blog/2008/05/08/stats-project-sociability-of-musical-instruments-using-facebook-data/",
        "content": "For my SI 544: Stats class this semester, I worked with two cool dudes, Jim Laing and Sameer Halai . Our project involved using data gathered from a Facebook application to test a hypothesis about the perceived sociability of certain musical instruments. If you recall, I wrote a blog post a few months ago about the viral vs. non-viral growth of Facebook applications that I had developed . One of those apps, Musical Instruments , lets you list which musical instruments you play. It’s kind of fun because some people play really whacked-out instruments (I play pianica and soprano trombone). I think playing instruments is typically a pretty social experience, which sort of led me to think about comparing the “sociability” of certain instruments to each other with the data gathered from this app. Users input their instruments via an autocompleting text field. If an instrument already exists in the database (and at least 3 or so users have claimed it), it will autocomplete. In the above screenshot, I’ve typed “Trumpet” and you can see there’s many different types of trumpet to choose from. A user can also type an instrument that doesn’t yet exist in the database and it’ll be added automatically. This kind of free vocabulary is nice because it doesn’t require an administrator to continuously accept new instruments. The data that the application has access to are: The user’s FBID (Their unique Facebook user ID in the form of a number) The instruments that the user claims to play The number of friends that the user has We ended up getting 8603 rows of data (user/instrument pairs). After getting a bunch of free text instruments, we went to work classifying many of them into groups and subgroups. So Piccolo is in the group “Flute” and subgroup “Woodwind.” We then generated a survey for people to rank 16 instruments in order of sociability. That is, people who play x instrument probably have more friends than y instrument. The survey results showed that people thought Vocalists had the most friends and that Guitar was pretty popular too. From the application data and survey results, we formed a hypothesis. We hypothesized that the instruments given high sociability rank would also have statistically higher mean numbers of friends. So people who played Guitar would have more friends than people who played Flute. First, we did some basic analysis of the data using R , the free stats program that we were using for class assignments and labs. This figure shows the histogram of frequency of number of friends. Basically, many people have 0-100 friends, less people have 101-200 friends, etc. This probably follows a power law curve, but we didn’t think it would be really important to find the alpha or anything for our purposes. This is a graph of the mean number of friends, by instrument. This looks like a pretty standard normal distribution and it shows off the central limit theorem that Lada is always talking about in class. This is just a boxplot of all of the classified instruments and their # of friends. There are some crazy outliers; people who have 1000 friends. From this boxplot, it’s hard to make out whether or not any of the means are actually statistically significant. Finally, we ran pairwise t-tests on each set of instruments. We could see that there was a significant difference in the mean number of friends for certain instruments. For example, Guitar and Horn, Guitar and Oboe, and Guitar and Saxophone. Looking at the mean number of friends for these instruments, Saxophone players had on average 20 more friends than Guitar players. This is interesting because Saxophone was ranked 10.7 (not very sociable) and Guitar was ranked very sociable. The scope of this project was pretty small, and given some more time, I think we could’ve come up with some more interesting conclusions. Stuff like “is flute really a girly instrument?” by looking at the average number of female flute players vs male flute players and “do guitar players get more chicks?” by looking at relationship status of guitar players vs. something like trumpet players (personal burn!). I was glad my Facebook app actually provided some interesting data. I’ve always been sort of skeptical to the ability of Facebook apps to be profitable. I think the data that the apps provide is very valuable in the context of social network research. Anyway, I hope you found this post to be somewhat entertaining. I’ve also uploaded the project report and presentation slides in PDF if you want to check them out. Many thanks to Jim and Sameer for sharing much of the work in this project. I ended up providing data, formatting it, and presenting the final presentation, so props to my teammates!"

So I was thinking of getting one of those nifty KVM switches that let you use one set of input devices for multiple computers. A KVM switch that supports DVI video inputs costs like, $175! Why so expensive!? I’m not an electrical engineer (or computer engineer even), but it doesn’t make sense that the hardware can cost so much. Couldn’t you just rig something up that just physically “switches” the wiring? Maybe the switch requires some power, but I can’t imagine the logic being that terribly complex. In comparison, a lot of the VGA KVM switches I’ve looked at cost maybe $25. What’s the difference, besides a few extra signals being re-routed? So my short term cheapo fix will probably be to buy a $19 Mini-dvi to VGA adapter for my Macbook. My monitor has multiple inputs (VGA, DVI, Component, Composite, S-Video) so I can just switch from VGA to DVI for Mac to PC. The video quality might suffer, but I probably won’t be able to tell the difference anyway (my older brother claims he can)."

Also, the cartoony quality of the graphics led to some weird cognitive dissonance as I led my cute dudes with their tanks off to die in gruesome battle. Days of Ruin sort of fixes this by making the graphics more gritty and changing the setting to a post-apocalyptic world. So everyone is fighting for food and survival instead of just for the hell of it. Unfortunately, the setting is not like Mad Max, where everyone is hoarding hockey pads and crossbows and gas. Seriously, you have factories that make tanks, but you can’t make food!? Get your priorities straight!!! So far, it’s been pretty fun, but the challenge level just seems really low.

        "content": "One thing I’ve noticed during my bus-riding career is that bus drivers have a really strong sense of camaraderie. Like, if a bus passes another bus, the bus driver might honk or wave at the other driver. During my days at UNM, this was pretty common since the busses took a circular route, and so it would make sense for a bus driver to say hi versus ignoring his/her co-worker. It was even pretty common for drivers to open up their windows, stop the bus, and start a little chat. This was kind of annoying since I was usually late for class. I think the camaraderie doesn’t end by just affiliating with the same university. I was riding the blue Michigan bus to work the other day and I noticed a cross-bus encounter! The school bus driver was talking to the city bus driver across busses! So this must be a really strong link between bus drivers of all types, regardless of employer or bus model. Is there some kind of strange connection being made between these bus drivers? Is bus driving school a really uniting experience, like boot camp? Do bus drivers stick together and maybe have bus driving school reunions? Is there a bus driver’s guild!? If anyone can shed light on this phenomenon I would greatly appreciate it. P.S. I spell the plural of bus “busses.” Technically, it’s correct. It’s like the British version or something."

        "content": "Facebook just recently released a fun new thingy called Lexicon. It shows you a graph of the occurrences of certain words or phrases over time on all Facebook walls. Since I do quite a lot of research using Facebook , I thought I’d take a look at it. Facebook has some suggested phrase pairs that you can use such as “party tonight” and “hungover.” And as expected, the phrases are cyclical and you tend to see a spike in “hungover” the day after “party tonight.” But it’s worth noting that you can’t prove causation by just correlation. What’s a little strange is that there doesn’t seem to be any growth going on in Facebook. Maybe they’ve normalized the data so you can spot trends, but you’d kind of assume that word counts would trend towards going up since Facebook is still supposedly growing. Or is Lexicon telling us something Facebook doesn’t want us to know about their growth? Anyway, at least one question of the ages has been put to rest. According to Lexicon, shampoo really is better than conditioner. STOP LOOKING AT ME, SWAN! Bonus Analysis: It looks like the word “happy” is used more on holidays like New Year’s Day and Valentine’s Day. But the word “merry” is kind of exclusively used on Christmas. See that strangely unhappy day near the beginning of March? Since it’s a leap year, Feb 29th was included in this graph. And since less people statistically have birthdays on that leap day, the word “happy” was recorded less. Pretty neat stuff, huh? I’m sure there’s other fun stuff to dig out of Lexicon, if you were really inclined to."

        "url": "/blog/2008/04/19/muxtape-bringing-back-the-art-of-the-mixtape/",
        "content": "So I’ve just recently discovered Muxtape. It’s a site that allows you to make a little “mixtape” of songs by uploading and then choosing which order they go in. The interface is pretty easy to figure out. You click on a song (or just the area around the song) and it’ll play automatically. It was working pretty well last night but for some reason the thing is choking in Firefox for me right now (and making Safari crash AND making IE run out of memory), yay for compatibility testing! Anyway, the site is neat because if you’re as old as I am, you might remember making mix tapes for your friends. There was an art to this. Instead of the crazy-huge capacities of an MP3 player that you have these days, tapes were limited to like, 90 minutes or something. And the order mattered too since tapes didn’t have skip functionality (unless you had a sweet-ass walkman with that feature built-in). Muxtape sort of forces a restriction on you by forcing you to choose only 12 songs, and by different artists (no dupes). Mix tapes were a labor of love and works of art! Muxtape is easier, but it also sorta reminds me of when I made mix tapes way back when. So a few criticisms. First off, while Muxtape tries to keep it real by limiting you to the number of songs and artists, it’s still probably way illegal. I wonder why the site hasn’t been shut down yet. Not saying I’d like the site to be shut down, but the reality is that it’s totally un-legit. You might say it’s fine because it only lets you stream, but using Firebug, you can pretty easily tell what the address is for the MP3. Also, lol at the constructed urls of the MP3s (the first get arg is “PLEASE=DO_NOT_STEAL_MUSIC”). Last.fm also pretty much is THE place to go for finding new music, and they have tons of searchable (which you could argue is kind of important!) tracks available. Though I did try and recreate my mixtape on last.fm and two artists were missing (one is the IBM computer “singing” Daisy Bell) and of the 10 remaining songs, only 6 had the full tracks playable So at least Muxtape wins as far as playability goes (though I did have to upload them myself)! There are probably some big legal issues that make it impossible for last.fm to do what Muxtape does. That’s probably good, since last.fm makes money for themselves and more importantly, artists, while Muxtape just makes money for themeselves (if you don’t count Amazon MP3 cuts going to artists). Last.fm makes artists money simply by streaming their music; no buying required. Anyway, if you want to check out my own mix, go here . Hopefully it’s varied enough to be worthy of mixtape status. You must understand, I’m a bit rusty."

It seems okay, I guess. I think I’m already used to the new UI that makes the back button bigger than the forward button. Even though I sort of hated it at first, I guess it makes sense since people go back more often than forward (via the buttons, anyway). So Firefox 3 runs a lot faster, and using a lot less ram. In the past, I have yelled at Firefox like Mel Gibson in Ransom asking for my ram back . I have 5 tabs open right now and I’m only (my expectations aren’t that high) using ~165MB or ram. The whole thing moves a lot faster too. I’m not sure if that’s because of the added side effect of more than half of my plugins not being compatible, though. I can live without most of them, but Firebug is really sort of indispensable. I hope FF3 comes out soon officially so everyone will get their plugins updated. There seems to be something weird going on with Flash 9 as well. Not too sure what. So far, I’d say Firefox 3 is lookin’ good. I totally skipped getting a Firefox 2 shirt , so I’ll definitely have to get the 3 when it ships!"

BUT, on a cursory stroll to Kotaku, I found out that Final Fantasy IV for DS is on its way for this Summer. Wait, FFIV for DS? Apparently it’s already out in Japan. That’s how behind on video game news I am. Perhaps it’s good that I don’t follow this stuff, though, because I’m not one to really like waiting for stuff anyway. There’s also a bunch of other neat Square games on DS like Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings and Crystal Chronicles. WTF? How’d I miss this stuff!? Final Fantasy IV (I want to say Final Fantasy II) was my first FF game, so it’s sort of near and dear to my heart. I just rediscovered my Nintendo DS, and my unfinished copy of Final Fantasy IV Advance! So I played for a couple of hours this weekend. It’s kind of weird playing it now since I’m used to a lot of story being told in FF games. Like, Rydia comes back from the dead and all you get is a simple three sentence explanation. Come on Rydia! We want details! Also, is it wrong to think Rydia is hot since she starts out being a kid in the game, and through some weird game mechanics, gets to be super hot later on? I must say, I’m a bit worried about the whole transition from old school game to DS 3D treatment. I played Final Fantasy III on DS and it was a bit disappointing. My main beef with these conversions is that they screw up the game mechanics. All of sudden you get the same number of random encounters, but there’s a cost of a few seconds because of fancy panning before the battle and the victory screen after the battle. Everything seems so snappy on the old school version of FFIV that I’m playing right now. Except for those damn vampire bats and their drain attack, whose animation takes FOR-EV-ER! Man, I sure do sound like a cranky old school gamer. I’ve been wanting to finish FFXII, but I think the time requirements on that one are a bit higher than FFIV. The whole dash thing they built into the game has made it play a lot faster. I remember when I played the original, I rented it for the weekend. So each weekend I would start the game on Friday, and by Sunday when we had to return it I had gotten to the underworld part, basically where you get Edge. Then the next weekend I’d just start over again. How sad, right! But it’s left me with pretty photographic memory of what happens at each step of FFIV. Right now I’m pretty damn far and I have only 9 hours on the game! So hopefully the conversion to DS doesn’t slow things down insanely."

I imagine they aren’t doing any kind of interesting (mathwise) stuff like weighing friends with low degree higher and friends with high degree lower. That would mean that friends who are friend whores count less toward your “People you might know” score than friends who have very few friends. And that’s why Facebook needs employees well versed in network analysis and graph exploration! *HINT HINT* Also, I’d really like to see a “DO NOT WANT” button for the douchebags who keep on showing up in my list of people I may know.

What about cron-jobs? What about running scripts? What about root access? I can’t see why Google didn’t just decide to copy Amazon and allow developers to upload a linux image or something.

Other bloggers complain of weight loss or gain, sleep disorders, exhaustion and other maladies born of the nonstop strain of producing for a news and information cycle that is as always-on as the Internet. I heard about Om Malik, but I didn’t know two other blogger dudes died of heart attacks. I guess I can imagine how this happens though. When I was starting my Anime Blog I wanted it to be successful, so I did spend quite a bit of time thinking about how to get to that point. After a while though, I just figured that blogging should be for fun, not dollars (even though my blogs actually do make some $$$). The article mentioned bloggers either gaining or losing weight due to blogging. I wonder if there’s a blogging diet! If anything, I think blogging has had an opposite effect on me… Of course, obsession to anything can be dangerous. Guys in Korea die of playing WoW all the time!

I’m not looking for an internship anymore, but I figured I’d have a chat to get to know the company better in case I want to work there after I graduate. I talked to two engineers. I can’t really remember their names now! Oops. But basically we talked about the technologies behind the service (it’s a real-time streaming tv service). It’s kind of interesting that they use P2P in order to distribute the live tv content. I thought this might end up with a pretty big delay in actually getting the content, but one of the guys said there was only a difference of ~20 seconds or so. One of the things that their website job page lists is that they want people with an interest in social networks. While I thought this was interesting and figured they might have something specific in mind, apparently they’re just trying to get people with knowledge in the area to maybe generate some ideas and build new stuff. Seems pretty cool. Something nice about this interview was that while it went like a typical job/internship interview (they asked me a question about some engineering problem I’ve faced and how I solved it), there was like, no pressure for me to really do well. I mean, besides the desire not to sound like an idiot to other people. I kind of liked having no pressure on me during the interview. I should probably pretend it’s like that for every interview I take, since I think I answered their questions pretty “well” regardless. So yeah, Zattoo is a startup in Ann Arbor.

This post isn’t really about their company though. It’s about their HR! There were a bunch of t-shirts on the table. I, being a t-shirt connoisseur, especially of the company shwag type, asked if I could have one. “But they’re reserved for interviewees,” the HR person Marissa Huang told me. She also said she could mail me one when she gets back to their headquarters, since they have a lot. I gave her my contact info and figured I’d never get the shirt. Here’s a story! When I went to interview at Google, they said I’d get some kind of awesome bag with Google related goodies in it. Like shirts and lava lamps and whatnot. Maybe not lava lamps. Anyway, it was supposed to be in my hotel room but I never got it. After the HR person at Google asked for my address for them to mail it, I felt that I’d get the stuff for sure, but I never did. It was like adding insult to the injury of not hiring me. By the way, I’ve fully recovered and hold no ill will towards the big G. Just throwing out this story to prove a point: why would imo.im go to the trouble of sending me a shirt when I didn’t even interview with them? But they did. And it came today. Which is why I award imo.im the official “Hung Truong Company Shwag Award Seal of Approval!” I don’t know if something can be both an award AND a seal of approval at the same time, but whatever. There was also a nice hand-written note in the package, which is unheard of as far as corporate HR goes. But imo.im is a startup, so I guess that makes them different. Anyway, thanks, imo.im , for the t-shirt. As a bonus, I’m even not adding a rel=”nofollow” to my links to you! Rock on!"

        "content": "For my SI 508 Networks class last semester I did an analysis of one of my Facebook applications, Notecentric. Notecentric was a social network that I had written during the Summer of ‘06 and I had recently ported it to the Facebook Developer Platform in Summer ‘07 shortly after the platform had been launched. The growth of Notecentric isn’t what I had hoped it would be. Not too many people use it, probably due to network effects of Facebook promoting a competing app (note to Facebook: if you want to promote a level playing field, don’t play favorites!) and other general performance issues (the application is pretty barebones and the RFacebook library I used to write it is pretty damn slow. It times out a lot!). Anyway, I got some neat network data from it, which made the whole thing worthwhile. You can check out the original paper I wrote last semester here . I’m going to be presenting my analysis during the School of Information’s annual expoSItion . It’s like a science fair except without the exploding volcanoes. During my Winter break, I developed another app, mainly for fun. It’s called Musical Instruments . Basically it lets you list which instruments you play and see which instruments your friends play. I had somewhat higher hopes for this application as a data gathering tool, and sure enough, it seems to be doing some cool stuff on first analysis. For expoSItion I figured I’d grab some data from this new app and compare the two. I ran some initial analysis on the Musical Instruments app. I won’t go over a lot of the original metrics I used (number of peers with app installed, percentage of peers with app installed, etc) and I’ll just skip to the pictures. This is an initial view of the Notecentric network: It’s pretty interesting because the application has two large strongly connected components. One includes me and the many others I influenced to add the application and the other is a bunch of people from the Philippines (I think) who decided to add and invite their friends to add the application. Pretty neat stuff. But the majority of the users lie outside of the two large components. The singleton users make up about 60% of the total users, more or less, during the evolution of the application. This signals to me that Notecentric was never really that “viral” in nature. People didn’t think the application was cool enough to invite their friends and people who saw their friends add the app didn’t feel compelled to add it themselves. Fair enough; it’s a pretty nerdy app. I mean, who wants to take notes on Facebook!? Here’s a picture of the Musical Instruments application network: It’s pretty small, so click on the image for a bigger one. This one is pretty neat. Instead of just two large strongly connected components, there’s a whole bunch! One is obviously bigger than the others, though there are quite a few clusters of users. It’s a little unrealistic to assume that this network would form into just one strongly connected component since Facebook users are generally decentralized and musicians can come from anywhere. If I did more analysis, I’d imagine that these components correspond to physical regions. Sure, there’s that “join this group if you’ve played music with someone in it” group, but I’m sure that’s not even a strongly connected graph! The growth of the Musical Instruments application is interesting. It follows the same sort of domination of large components (possibly due to me inviting all of my friends) but instead of letting smaller components take over, the large (size 5 or bigger) components eventually stabilize at somewhere like 55% or so. This indicates to me that the Musical Instruments application is actually better at viral growth. People seem to invite their musical friends and others want to add the app if they see it on a friend’s profile. This is also the impression I’ve gotten from the add statistics available from Facebook. Overall, it’s fun to see how the differences in application usage contribute to the kind of growth that each application sees. Notecentric has been stuck at around 670 active installs for a few months now. Compare that to Musical Instruments, which has been growing by around 20 users a day, and has around 2,700 so far. The growth of Musical Instruments is by no means monumental, but it is seeing some success due to its sharable nature. I’m planning on showing the images that I’ve posted and perhaps some fun statistics that show the differences in the growth of the two apps. I think I’ll also load up GUESS on my laptop so people can check out the two networks in a more interactive setting. There’s prizes for the expoSItion of $750, $500 and $200 for first, second and third place, respectively. There’s also a $500 and $250 prize from Microsoft for entries specifically in Social Computing (which my project should qualify for). So hopefully I’ll make a few Benjamins for my work!"

But oh well. Fire Eagle is a centralized location information service, basically. You can use its built-in APIs to set user location information and grab user information from it (assuming you have the correct permissions). This is cool because in the past, applications have had to do this location stuff on their own. For example, if I wanted to set up a Twitter clone that knew a user’s location, I’d have to be able to take the information and process it, and retrieve it later. Fire Eagle handles a lot of stuff like figuring out exactly where a user when things might be ambiguous (I typed in “University of Michigan” and it gave me a choice between the main campus and the Dearborn one). I’m planning on coding up some location aware applications at some point soon, so I think it’ll be fun to try and see what I can do with the help of this Fire Eagle thing. Yahoo has definitely done something unique and I give them some props for working on this service!"

        "content": "Since it’s Spring break for University of Michiganers, I’ve had some free time to mess around with learning stuff I don’t have time for when school is in session. Something I’ve been meaning to try out is memcached, which is an uber-efficient way to cache stuff in memory so you don’t end up hitting the database a lot for redundant queries. I installed memcached on my mediatemple machine using some directions I found online specifically for centos. I don’t have yum or rpm or whatever people use for putting new stuff onto their linux boxes. I just wget, untar, and make/make install. I had to make a symbolic link for the libevent thing that I installed as well since the path wasn’t set up correctly. I’m still trying to get memcached to run automatically as a daemon when I boot up. I tried sticking a line in the /etc/init.d/ or something rc.local but it hasn’t really worked. Oh well. I’m using memcached right now along with a rails gem called “Cached Model” that does a pretty good job of automating the caching process. What’s important to know is that the gem only caches Active Records that are found via a simple find on id. It won’t cache more complex queries. Right now I have it running on my Animenano site caching a bunch of objects. I’ve seen a small though noticeable difference. Memcached isn’t without its caveats, however. For one thing, your initial db hit is going to take longer than normal since you’re going to be checking memcached, then grabbing the data from the db, then saving the data into memory. From reading the logs, this doesn’t really take that much extra time. The time saved is likely more worthwhile. I’m always trying to squeeze more performance out of my sites. Periodically I’ll go check out my log files and see if there’s anything taking an insane amount of time to render (like, .1 seconds or so). I’ve caught a few bad algorithm decisions that I had made in the past, and I think for the most part my sites run pretty efficiently. Memcached is a pretty fun way to slice some time off of the page rendering times for Anime Nano. If you have a few spare hours to kill and a rails app that seems to be a little slow, it might be worthwhile to install memcached and see if caching your Active Record objects will speed things up. I’m seeing a speedup of maybe 1/2 (it takes half as long to load a page) vs running without memcached. That’s totally non-empirical observation, though."

About five seconds into the interview, I realized that the description given to me and the actual content of the internship would be quite different. The position was described as “iPhone QA Engineer,” which listed duties like “functional testing of iPhone applications” and “design and implementation of test plans and test cases, risk analysis, &amp; integration testing across the system.” The description that my interviewer gave was that I’d be working on an internal iPhone web application for tracking test results and other stuff. Definitely not as interesting as I thought it would be. It’s probably still kind of cool, but not as cool as doing actual QA on the iPhone. By the time the interview had finished, I knew it would be a bad fit and that I would get an email with the same sentiments. Sure enough, about two hours after the interview had ended I got an email from the recruiter saying there wasn’t a fit. He said he’d send it to a few other departments in Apple as well. Cool guy. I’m not too upset about this particular rejection, other than the fact that I feel it was incorrectly described, which cost me a bit of time in my preparation. It was still a good experience, and I got to ask a few questions about the company culture at Apple. In other non-news, I actually got a successful internship offer, so to speak. But it’s not quite official yet so I can’t write about it until it is."

First they seem to be losing the Yahoo takeover, then they reject me. Don’t worry, there’s some sarcasm in there! A little. In other news, I just got an email from Apple for an internship in their iPhone software group. Cool! I think that would be the best fit as any with me + Apple since I’m not too into the low level details of OS coding. But doing iPhone software would be really cool! The listing on the website didn’t mention any kind of internship in iPhone, so I’m glad I took a chance and talked to the Apple booth when I went to the engineering career fair last week. I still haven’t heard back from Zazzle but it’s still early in the internship game. Actually, I haven’t heard back from many companies. I’m not really sweating it or anything though. I’ll find something to do during the Summer, even if it’s not with a company."

Fridays are good too. I actually end up spending quite a bit of time planning where my next free meal will come from. For example, there’s a Teach For America thing going on tomorrow at the Union that will have food from Zingerman’s. Thursday there’s a company info session and Friday there’s a panel/session, both of which will offer free food. That’s already like, $20 in food savings for me (if I had eaten out at some place near campus, which would be the most likely scenario)! At one point I pondered whether I could run an experment: to eat only free food for the entire semester! I decided that I would probably end up starving or getting really weak while begging for food. I found a site called “ Hungry Hungry Coeds ” that lists free food events at some select campuses. Luckily it seems that the creators of the site went to Michigan, or at least the main contributor goes here. I’ll be checking it routinely to see if I can maximize my free food intake. Maybe I should also keep a log of all the free food I eat per week. Could end up being another blog…"

The two places I’ve heard back from so far are Microsoft (I talked with some people at the Engineering Career Fair) and Zazzle (they replied to my email like, 45 minutes after I sent my resume and cover letter!). Both companies I “interviewed” with (I got some short informational interviews) were looking for PM types. The PM here is either product or project management. I think they’re pretty similar and the actual job really depends on the context of which company it’s at. I think the PM stuff differs quite a bit from standard software engineering in that you’re expected to think about the product as a whole rather than the implementation details alone. So that involves stuff like considering the design, the user, how decisions affect both, and tradeoffs that each solution results in. It’s pretty interesting stuff that requires a lot of thought. I’m sort of training myself to think a bit more critically about things than I have in the past. Anyway, hopefully some more companies will contact me too. I’m still waiting to hear back from Zazzle and Microsoft (which might include Yahoo, who knows? But that possible merger probably won’t happen for a while). Hopefully I can get a better idea of what these jobs entail, and make a decision on what I want to end up doing after I graduate."

Except the sound quality is much, much better. Of special note are some new versions of old songs! According to the TMBG wiki , the songs were recorded at XM Studio, whatever that means. It’s pretty neat hearing new versions of Shadow Government, Withered Hope, and Mr. Me! The turtle sounds thing is pretty funny too, mentioning the Fibonacci Sequence . There’s also some songs about numbers that are no doubt directed towards turning children into fans of TMBG at an early age.

My opinion on suits is that I hope I’ll never work anywhere that requires one, except for maybe at a company formal party or something. I guess it’s pretty standard attire for an internship fair, but I think distinguishing yourself is important too. Everyone looks the same in a suit. Luckily, I distinguished myself as the idiot who didn’t bring a suit. Mostly I just wandered around looking all the companies. Quite a few had really long lines just to talk to a recruiter. The place was packed, too. There were probably a few hundred people in any given room. I talked to some people from Liberty Mutual. The guy was laid back and pretty cool. He told me to check their website for any openings, and I got a pen and a weird bendy thing (it’s like, a blue bendy stick). I also checked out this local web development company called Enlighten . They were laid back as well. I talked to them a bit about web development and they gave me some cool magnetic thinking putty. I played with it. It’s sorta magnetic, but not highly magnetic. Like you wouldn’t replace an industrial strength electromagnet with it or anything. Most of my social interactions went pretty smoothly, I must say. There was one that I could probably call the worst of the year so far. I went up to the Macy’s corner and some guy said something and stuck out his hand. Now, I know when a person wants to shake my hand, I’m not an idiot. But I didn’t hear what he said, and I thought he said something like, “name?” So I was like, “Hung,” and I pointed to my name tag. Then he said something else I couldn’t hear, so I said it louder and pointed more furiously, “HUNG!” I thought he wanted to take something, instead of shaking my hand. Anyway, I finally shook his hand. Then, I asked if there were any engineering type jobs at Macy’s. He said that no, there were only management type jobs. I guess our interaction could’ve just ended there. But then I noticed something. Standing right behind the guy was a larger version of the guy. It was him, but bigger, and printed out on a large piece of paper. “Is… that… you?” I slowly asked with furrowed brow. “THAT’S YOU!” And indeed, it was him on the promotional banner. He said it was taken a year or so ago. Without thinking, I said something like, “Could you stand next to it and do the same pose!?” I think he was starting to get tired of my shenanigans. He actually contemplated it before not doing it. Then he suggested I leave by saying something like, “well, good luck in your internship search!” I took the hint, but not before asking for a bouncy Macy’s ball. It glows when you bounce it."

If you’re wondering what a pianica is, it’s like a melodica, except when Yamaha makes it they call it a pianica. More specifically, it’s sort of like this cross between an accordion and a harmonica, where you just get a keyboard and you need to blow into it to get the reeds moving. It’s “famous” for being in that manga, Nodame Cantabile, which I totally like, which is mostly why I bought it. I practiced a bit today, but I really suck at keyboard. I never really bothered learning how to play, but I do read music, so that’s how I was able to BS my way through Oh Susannah: Your browser does not support the video tag. Not very good, but this take was funny because I put a seven chord at the end. I actually like Oh Susannah a lot. The words make no sense. The reason I didn’t play any left hand at the end is because I found some free sheet music online, but they only showed the first page! GRRRR.

Wynton and the gang are already criticized enough for playing “era” music, so it’s weird that they limited themselves even further. The sounds were definitely authentic-sounding, but it’s funny because whenever someone takes a solo, you can hear them sort of drift into the future (or our present) and play licks that would have been unheard of (well, at least unheard) in Duke’s band. I mean, what’s the point of sounding so accurate and then playing a solo that’s got hard bop licks? Overall though, it was pretty sweet. And they played C Jam Blues as an encore.

        "content": "So January (and in some ways, December) is the time to start looking for internships. I’ve already done quite a bit of looking along with sprucing up my portfolio site (the projects section has accordion effects now!) and updating my resume. I think part of the reason it’s difficult to search for internships is because I’d like to define the internship rather than the employer defining it for me. I understand the need to succinctly say, here’s what the internship position is, but too often I end up seeing generic “software engineering” of which I have no idea what they entail. Hey, maybe some potential companies are looking at my blog! Then I can define what I’m looking for in an internship and they can contact me if they agree! But part of the problem is that I’m also unsure of what I’m looking for in an internship. Okay, perhaps a lengthy blog post will fix that. I’m originally a classically trained Computer Scientist. That’s what my B.S. is in, and that’s what I can do on paper. So I should qualify for all of these generic Software Engineering positions. Going into grad school, I’ve been under the impression that maybe there is something more interesting than vanilla software engineering. Of course, my knowledge of “vanilla software engineering” is not really based on facts of any kind. I did some freelance software engineering work for a company over the Summer, but I don’t think that’s indicative of any typical SE work. Actually, it’s probably generally false to assume that there exists a typical software engineering job. Maybe I’m oversimplifying. Anyway, let’s move along. So far, I’ve been happy with my grad school experience. There are a lot of ideas floating around, a lot of real research being done, and smart people all around. I’ve done a project in my Networks class that could theoretically be considered research, and I find it interesting to just investigate things for the sole purpose of learning stuff. My question is, what should I look for in an internship? Of course I want to learn something. Do I want to get a research internship? Would a software engineering internship betray the academic lifestyle I’ve so enjoyed? Am I being an internship snob? This is what’s going on in my head. Let’s take a brief interlude by checking out the internships I think are totally awesome, and why I think they’re awesome! Not surprisingly, Google is on the top of my list for their internships. One reason is that their recruiting is second to none, seriously. Just look at Google’s internship page (which is fairly simple to find from their homepage) and compare it to Yahoo’s… oh wait, they don’t have an internship page to speak of. The Yahoo one just tells you to type “intern” in their way bad job search engine… Okay, so onto the Google internships. The single internship I want most is “Associate Product Manager Intern.” Tangent: I was at the Google info session last year and talked to someone about opportunities for someone who was an engineer but has become slightly “more.” Again, I don’t want to sound like a snob or anything, I’m just talking about additional education. The Google guy told me I might want to apply as a PM. Apparently, Product Manager is an entry level position. I always thought that Software Engineers were promoted to PM status after working for a while. Anyway, the description leads me to believe that this is right up my alley: The area: Product Management Google’s Product Management group leads the processes that enable our company to bring innovative, world-changing products to market. Our team works closely with Engineering to help design and develop technologies that improve access to the world’s information. We’re responsible for analyzing user needs and guiding our products throughout the execution cycle. Our team offers a range of opportunities for candidates with less than two years of job experience who desire breadth and variety in their job responsibilities. The role: Associate Product Manager Intern As an Associate Product Manager Intern, you’ll work with engineers to define new features for existing products based on your understanding of user needs. You’ll also conduct research on markets and our competitors, focus on strategies that impact the direction of future products and develop leadership experience in a variety of Google’s product areas. Associate Product Manager Interns are given important responsibilities, generous access to resources and many opportunities to learn about other areas the organization. Technical, analytical and strategic planning skills are vital to performing successfully in this position. Responsibilities: Understanding and analyzing user needs. Helping to define a product vision and strategy. Working with world-class engineers to build and launch new features. Requirements: Currently pursuing a BA/BS in Computer Science or related field, and graduating in 2009. Excellent written and oral communications skills. Strong organizational and analytical skills. Strong technical abilities. Demonstrated capacity for developing and understanding strategy. Deep interest in creating and analyzing products. At this point, I think this position is about as close to my ideal internship as any will get. I really enjoy coming up with new products and applications. I like designing and building them, and analyzing them! It seems like it would balance creativity and practice pretty well. Do any other companies take interns for PM positions? It still seems a bit strange to me, not that I would complain if I got it… Google also has an internship for Software Engineering Statistician Intern. I think the requirements for that one are maybe a bit out of reach for me (I’m taking a stats course this semester) but it seems interesting. As far as other prospects go, I was already shot down for a Facebook Internship , but that one was in Software Engineering. There is a full time position for “Data Insights” that seems interesting. I want to apply for it and ask if they’ll take me as an intern. Another interesting “make mine an internship” internship could be the Research Analyst position on Digg’s job page. I’ve read that companies aren’t as averse to internship-ifying jobs as one might think. It shows I have the proactivity to get things done, right? Right!? There are a few research labs that I was thinking of applying to as well. PARC, IBM, Microsoft, Yahoo (if they ever get any posts up). All of those labs have some group that is interested in social computing in one way or another. Yahoo is actually especially interesting because their labs have access data to Yahoo properties like Flickr, Delicious and Yahoo 360. And those are just about all the places that I have considered so far. I think at this point, it is difficult for me to find an “appropriate” internship because there haven’t been any graduates from the University of Michigan School of Information with the specialization in Social Computing yet. It’s new from last semester! Anyway, if you have any good suggestions, please leave a comment, or you can use my contact form that’s on my about page , too!"

Google doesn’t ask you who you friends are, they just have some algorithm to determine it. An algorithm. To determine who your friends are. While I am very confident in certain algorithms (like say, Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm ), I believe it’s quite easy to figure out who one’s friends are by FUCKING ASKING THE PERSON! The worst part is, in order to remove these stupid stories, you must delete these people from your contacts list. So really, there’s an extreme binary relationship: either you are someone’s friend and you email them, or you are not their friend and you will never email them, ever. Google will not be able to beat Facebook at social software if they can’t figure out how to ask someone who their friends are. This move shows an utter lack of understanding of human nature. Google thinks they can solve things mathematically when asking a user will completely suffice. The algorithm-worship there has seriously got to stop."

I haven’t really ever used Vista, but I’ve been bombarded with frustration since roughtly 8:30am, so enjoy my stream of consciousness tirade while I get my mom’s computer working the way it should! Vista: Get your act together, man! You know the first thing that happened after my mom created her admin account? “Windows Explorer is not responding, do you want to [end process] [wait] [uninstall Vista].” I would’ve chosen the tertiary, if it had existed. Dell: What’s up with all this crap pre-installed on my system? I don’t want Google Toolbar or Google Desktop! I don’t want random Dell crap using my resources, I don’t want… Norton Internet Security: WTF!? You’ll protect my mom’s computer for 30 days? And then stop protecting it? This seriously amounts to some kind of extortion. And why does it take 10 years to finally uninstall all of you!? And… Vista: Why do you need my permission to do anything and everything!? Would you like my permission to change contexts? Load up the kernel? Reference and dereference memory? Because I could hit “okay” all day if you wanted me to. Okay, I’ve disabled this in the control panel. Yet I needed to restart to get it to work. Though when I restarted, Vista decided to install a bunch of security updates without asking me first. Hey, Vista, don’t assume I have all day to wait for you to install these security holes that you shouldn’t have shipped with in the first place! Oh man, I’m getting angry… At least it didn’t just restart randomly, like my own desktop has been doing lately (I disabled that, too). Okay, so now stuff is sort of working properly. Except that Vista is actually slower than XP was before. Or maybe it’s this AMD chip that’s somehow found its way into my mom’s computer. (Full disclosure, my mom works at Intel).

        "content": "So my friend Krystle made it clear on Monday that she wanted to see someone named Ingrid Michaelson in concert on Wednesday. I had no idea who this person was, so I checked out her website and listened to a few songs. Apparently she’s had quite a few songs appear in Grey’s Anatomy and in TV commercials like Old Navy. I thought she sounded pretty good, but what about live!? Now, a lot of times, an artist will sound good on a CD merely by virtue of having a good sound guy to tweak the pitches to perfection. But after seeing a clip of her sing the Old Navy commercial song live, I was convinced. She sounded even better live! So three of us went to the concert on Wednesday, almost freezing to death in line due to a sloth-like ticket ripper dude at The Blind Pig. This guy was seriously doing like, one ticket a minute. It’s a good thing Krystle got the tickets early, because they apparently sold out while we were in line. The set started out with some stuff by Allie Moss, who also serves as Ingrid’s backup guitar and vocals. It’s a very economic setup. Allie was actually quite good. But everyone was kind of ready to hear Ingrid after a few songs. And once Ingrid started singing, it was apparent why Allie is the sideman and Ingrid is the headliner. Her voice is freakin’ awesome! Basically, Ingrid can do pretty much whatever she wants vocally as far as range and other weird things that people learn in voice training. While some of her songs are a bit simplistic and “funky” in terms of arrangement, I think her voice really makes up for her lack of anything else. Ooh, strange cognitive dissonance: Right before she came on, the DJ dude or whoever asked everyone to stop smoking because she’s sensitive. But the lyric in her song says “If you need a light, I’ll find a match!” I know it’s just a lyric, but hey, come on! Ummm what else? The Old Navy song (The Way I Am) and the Breakable song were really good. I mean, mostly everything was good. Also, it felt like VH1 storytellers because we’d get the story behind a bunch of songs, which works well when you don’t have a bunch of songs to fill up a set. Ingrid had a good stage presence, seeming very humble. Though perhaps it was well rehearsed humbleness!!! I don’t really doubt her humbleness though, she seemed really nice. Like she’d get happy when people knew what song she was playing. Also, she told a story about how she was doing a promo event at Borders and said “Thanks to Barnes and Noble for having me!” Oh, and she pointed out that there’s a live version of a song on her Myspace page where, at the end, she says “thanksss~~~” and it sounds really funny. There were also a bunch of covers thrown in for good measure. She played Mele Kalikimaka, a naughty Christmas song called “Trim Your Tree,” (in fact, here it is !) and “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” I probably sound like I’m enamored now, but seriously, anything her voice touches turns to GOLD! So yeah, it was a good show, and it was cool to see her before she eventually becomes stinkin’ famous. Hopefully she’ll come around the Ann Arbor area again some time soon."

I guess I should’ve capitalized all those words… Oh, and Android is the OHA’s new mobile development platform. Basically, we all had a brainstorming session with ideas for fun new mobile apps. There were a lot of cool ideas thrown out. Afterwards, we all got into smaller groups and developed some app ideas. Our group came up with this sensor that tells you if you’re in close proximity to someone really often. I believe there was some study done where people wore these RFID things and it turned out that they were in close proximity to complete strangers very often (like at the bus stop or grocery store or something). So the app could say, “hey, you’re together often, maybe you should be friends” or something. The coolest part of the meetup was that it was partly sponsored by Google, which means there was free pizza, drinks, and most importantly, Google cups. They were the same as that one red Google cup I got as my consolation prize (the grand prize being a job at Google). I picked up one of each color (blue, green, yellow and red) since I didn’t know if they’d go to waste afterwards. I guess SOCHI just sorta stows them away until another Google sponsored event. Oops! Writing this post is also a way for me to procrastinate on my business plan which is due tomorrow for my entrepreneur class. The business? A software development company specializing in mobile applications on the Android platform. Which it wasn’t at the beginning of the semester, but that’s a whole other story…"

The title, “Innovation and Evolution -How Search, Social Media, and New Ideas can Shape the Next Web,” intrigued me enough to compel me to check it out. Much of the talk was devoted to Flickr, and how lots of useful information can be extracted from the inherent metadata of tags, traffic, and geodata of the photos on the site. For example, Flickr can make a list of “interesting” photos, figure out correlations between tags and photos (it can semi-distinguish between photos of love between two people, love as a symbol, and love as puppies), and figure out the location of Route 66. I was vehemently unimpressed by an earlier Yahoo talk this year, but today’s was neat. Probably because the speaker knew what he was talking about. Fun fact: the speaker is VP of the Advanced Development Division at Yahoo. Or ADD. Apparently the name was not an accident. He mentioned quite a few interesting things like their “Brick House” incubator, and a few products of it like Pipes and something called Kickstart . Kickstart seems to be something of a mix between Facebook and LinkedIn. Or something. I had to sign up for a Yahoo account to use it. Minor tangent: I hate Yahoo because I can’t get the login info for all of my old usernames (because I don’t use them anymore) so whenever I want to use something Yahoo, I have to sign up for a new account. And since Yahoo has so many users, no sane usernames exist anymore. It took me like 30 minutes to come up with escargoal (like a cross between escargot and goal)! I’m not sure how many social networks Yahoo wants… They’ve got that Yahoo 360, Mash, Kickstart… I guess an alternate strategy to buying Facebook could be diluting the social network market… But anyway, the talk was pretty cool, though somewhat high level for a crowd of CS kids (and SI kids, I suppose). Where was the talk of computational complexity and algorithms in Flickr!? The talk has at least rewarmed my interest in looking for a Summer internship at Yahoo, possibly in the ADD…"

It’s mostly the Chet Baker version that appears on “ The Best of Chet Baker Plays .” I’ve got a few other versions that are pretty good, like the Bill Evans one . My friend David always likes to point out how bad the words for this song are. They really are probably the worst lyrics to a jazz standard ever: The song a robin sings, Through years of endless springs, The murmur of a brook at evening tides. That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide. That great symphonic theme, That’s Stella by starlight, And not a dream, My heart and I agree, She’s everything on this earth to me. Does anyone know what a song that a robin sings through years of endless springs sounds like? Or a murmur of a brook rippling though a nook? And Stella by starlight is a vision, not a sound, right? Couldn’t we say something about Stella herself, rather than babble endlessly about stupid rhymes (brook and nook make me stabby)? If you can look past the shitty lyrics, the melody is really nice. Plus this song has the distinction of having some unique changes that I can’t really say sound like any other song. Off the top of my head, at least. The tune works well uptempo or as a ballad, too.

        "content": "I just got back from the TMBG Concert. So the opening band was called Oppenheimer . They’re two guys from Northern Ireland, apparently. The band seems like a suitable opener for TMBG, since they consist of two guys. The bald guy plays drums and sings, and the slightly chubby one plays guitar and sings with the robot-inducing keyboard thing. Voicebox? I’m glad I got The Else before this concert, because it sucks not knowing the songs when a band plays it live. Something about having to process the song instead of sort of knowing what’s going to happen. With Oppenheimer, I didn’t know any songs, so it was sorta hard to get it. Plus their songs were all very electronicy. Like with sustained chords and such. They were pretty cool though. The chubby guitarist also seemed really into it, sort of like a guitar-playing Star Wars Kid ! TMBG started off with one of their new songs, The Cap’m and ended up playing quite a few of The Else songs. After the first song, Flans told everyone to go stand in the front, so I ran into the aisle to the 10th row or so. Maybe closer. That was cool, since my seat was right behind an Amazonian lady. Nothing against her, but I couldn’t see Oppenheimer because of her massive head (and its height). So I got to rock out in the aisle the whole show. It was cool! They played a mix of songs mostly from their newer albums (The Else, The Spine, and Mink Car) and a few of the “classics.” They didn’t play Ana Ng, Don’t Let’s Start or She’s an Angel, which was kind of dissapointing. But they did play The Famous Polka! Without the words… Ooh, they played Why Does The Sun Shine? and Meet James Ensor though, which almost makes up for it. And Doctor Worm. And New York City. It was a good show. If I could have done the playlist, I’d have taken off Cyclops Rock (though it actually sounds good live) and XTC Vs Adam Ant. They also played this weird song where they listed countries in alphabetical order that I’ve never heard before. It must be off the kid’s album. With those songs removed, I would’ve added those previously mentioned unplayed songs, and maybe some of Linnell’s state songs (Montana!). Also strange was the absence of my favorite song of the new album, Upside Down Frown… It made me turn my smile upside down. Temporarily. They did play the Mesopotamian one though. Singing-wise, they were very good. I actually think they sound better live. There’s a lot more energy in their live show that doesn’t get transmitted in the CDs. Linnell really belts it out, as well as Flansburgh (especially during Istanbul (not Constantinpole)’s interlude part. Some songs that I’ve disliked in the past sounded better live. They also had some weird skits, like they made a phone call with some dead person. Tonight (I dunno if it changes) was Jerry Orbach , who I didn’t even realize was dead! Apparently the rest of the audience didn’t know who he was by his name (along with me), since They sorta had to explain the gag. Then Jerry (Flans) and Linnell (Linnell) had a duet. TMBG left somewhat suddenly after playing their Mesopotamian song. Then the audience started clapping and the house lights didn’t go on, so we kept clapping and yelling until the band came back to play more songs. Then they played a couple more songs and left again. Then we got them to come back again. I know it’s part of the showmanship thing, but playing a part in this rehearsed set of events kind of makes me feel used. Psychologically though, I guess it was better than if they just said “so long!” after their real last song. Having played quite a few gigs in a band myself, I can say that people sort of expect you to play another song after you say you’re done. So it’s always kind of good to cover your ass by saying you’re done when you’re not. Because fans get pretty pissed when you quit without doing an encore. Except if you fucked up that night, which also happened a lot in the band I was in. But I digress… Overall, it was a cool show, and I think I got my money’s worth. It’s sort of strange seeing these people that you’ve heard for years actually making music on the fly. Like “whoa, this music is made by real people!” I’d have stayed and tried to get something autographed, but I heard that they weren’t going to meet fans after the show. I went to the merch place and they had CDs that were pre-autographed. Sort of lame, really. It’s not like the CDs were priced any higher than normal, but at least show up to say hi to the fans! Okay, I didn’t stick around, so maybe they did, but they definitely gave the impression of not caring with the pre-autographed stuff. If I ever get a chance to see them again, I’ll probably take it. I had a good time. If this was an eBay transaction, it’s probably go something like: “SUPER FAST SHIPPING GREAT COMM WOULD BUY FROM AGAIN AAAA+++++++!!!!!!” But don’t they all?"

        "content": "Whoa, so I just got The Else in the mail. And just in time, since the TMBG concert is tomorrow night! I had gotten psyched for it this weekend by watching the TMBG documentary, Gigantic. I guess I could’ve written about it too. Maybe I will later. But this is a review of the new(ish) CD! Tracks: 1. I’m Impressed I think They Might Be Giants is trying to trick reviewers into giving good reviews of the CD by calling their first song “I’m Impressed.” And either by cognitive osmosis or pure wordplay, the reviewer will somehow work in the phrase into his/her review. This is a Linnell song, apparently. I just assume that whoever sings the song is the person who wrote it. Umm… The actual song seems to be about a guy who’s impressed by natural disasters (like plane crashes and Godzilla attacks). But he’s also scared. I guess I’d give it a solid 7? Maybe a 6. 2. Take Out The Trash This is a Flansburgh song. He’s petitioning for a girl to dump some dude. And it’s Thursday now. The song’s not particularly melodic, instead featuring Flansburgh’s trademark “Olive Oyl-like singing.” It’s nothing special. 5? 3. Upside Down Frown This may be the best song of the album. It’s a Linnell. There’s this crazy frantic drumbeat underneath the calm guitar strumming. I like it! Like all good TMBG songs, this one’s meaning can be left to interpretation. I think it’s about some dude getting dumped who seems happy about it. I guess he’s taken the oft-given advice to turn his frown upside down. The only problem is that obviously sad people who are smiling seem kinda sinister/crazy… I give it a 9! 4. Climbing The Walls This is a song about a dude who is way too high strung. But he’s found a good outlet for it: climbing the walls. I think that’s merely metaphorical, but what do I know? This is a fairly typical Linnell song. By which I mean it’s really repetitive, except when we get a refreshing bridge! Like most Linnell songs, this one’s incredibly melodic. It’d work just as well without any backing at all. Which I think is a mark of a good song. Best line of the album: “I was grinding my teeth / I was wasting my youth / And using up my teeth.” I’ll give it a 7.5. 5. Careful What You Pack Okay, this is the “Flansburgh sings like a girl” song of the album. This song doesn’t make any sense, and it’s not fun to listen to. 3. 6. The Cap’m Is this song about Captain Crunch? No. It’s about a guy who likes to be called the “Cap’m.” Apparently people think you can’t be called that unless you drive a boat. There’s nothing really striking about this song. It’s musical filler. It sounds like it was written in less than an hour. Which is bad, in this case. Especially given this is a Linnell song. I’d give it a 5. 7. With The Dark John Flansburgh sings some harmony with himself in this song. But I think they’re questionable harmonies. At least this one’s sort of funky (by which I mean, there are some funky horns)! There’s some nautical elements in this song, which make me think it might fit in with The Cap’m? The song is just all over the place though. I don’t like stupid all over the place songs!!! It seriously feels like they’re just making shit up as they go. 3. 8. The Shadow Government Okay, so this song’s a little more cohesive and maybe even rockin’. It’s still a little random though (in the bad way). It uses the the quote “I doth protest,” though, so I can’t give it too bad of a score. 5? 9. Bee Of The Bird Of The Moth This song is fucking weird. Which is good. Subject: Hummingbird moth who’s acting like a bird that thinks it’s a bee. The lyrics are really mind-numbing. A Linnell song, it’s once again fairly repetitive. But the funkyness and strange lyrics sort of redeem this song. I give it a 7. 10. Withered Hope This song is all about the buildup. It starts off soft, giving some exposition of sad sack and withered hope. I guess they’re characters, and not just anthropomorphic emotions. As the plot is revealed, the song really ramps up! And by plot, I mean new characters such as “soul mate,” “crook” and “motorbike” are added. It’s sort of a love pentangle. The whole song is weird and great. 8.5! 11. Contrecoup Contrecoup had a lot of words that I had to look up. Which makes it good? Apparently this dude is too obsessed with science, including phrenology (analyzing a person’s character from their head shape) the science of being in love (Limerence!). He was hit in the head, which made him fall in love. Or something. Maybe he’s just a hypochondriac. Of love. I like the idea, but the song itself (as a song) really isn’t that great. 6. 12. Feign Amnesia Feigning amnesia is a pretty good coping mechanism. What this dude is coping with, I’m not quite sure. It’s probably one of the better Flansburgh songs. But that’s not saying much. 5. 13. The Mesopotamians People think the Mesopotamians died out or something. In fact, they just started a traveling band. This song is sort of like “We’re the Replacements” except with a dead civilization. It also sorta reminds me of those “band songs” where the bands sing about what they’re all about. Like “The Monkees.” It gets cleverness points, along with some “I guess it’s not a bad song” points. I’ll give it a 7. Hmm. So the trend of me liking the Linnell songs and not liking the Flansburgh songs continues. I don’t really like any of the Flan songs, though most of the Linnell songs are at least decent. There’s probably 3-4 songs that I like on this new album. That’s still not very good, but it’s better than the 2 songs I liked on The Spine and the 0 songs I liked from Mink Car. I had heard that this album was the best TMBG has released since Apollo 18. It probably is, but that’s not really saying much. I guess it’s nice that they’re slowly getting “better” since having hit rock bottom with Mink Car. I’m still waiting for State Songs Vol. 2 from Linnell… Hopefully they’ll play some “classics” (She’s an Angel, Don’t Let’s Start, etc) at the concert tomorrow."

And she beat me handily. So handily, in fact, that I was resolute to come up with a way to have my revenge. I’m the kind of person who likes to play smart, not hard. And I’m a programmer. So put one and one together. Go ahead, I’ll give you some time to predict what I did. YES, I WROTE A PROGRAM TO CHEAT AT BOGGLE! I mean, it’s sort of this fun problem if you think about it. My solution used a lot of recursion (probably too much), and a dictionary function that verified actual words. And it worked pretty well, too. I beat one of my coworkers 70 points to 1. Of course, afterwards I fully disclosed this information. I’d never be able to live up to the hype if someone challenged me to a live game anyway. I mostly cheated to see if my program was any good. And apparently it was. My plan was to make it to the top of the leaderboard, then retire from the business altogether. I have to hand it to the Bogglific people; they’re pretty clever. They detected that I was cheating and banned me. And I have nothing against that. I knew what I was getting wrapped up in. I still even have my pride intact, since it was my program that I was cheating with! I understand though that cheaters should be banned. It really isn’t fair for everyone else who comes up with their three and four letter words. I’m thinking of adapting my Boggle solver into a Facebook app. For educational purposes only, of course. Like, check out all the words you missed! It’ll be a sort of Boggle trainer… Anyway, I am taking my Boggle banishment in stride. I hold nothing against my oppressors. At least now I’ll have some free time to work on my Scrabulous Solver (which is actually a somewhat more computationally complex (and interesting) problem…)."

So I sorta just staggered around, getting stuff I needed. I went to the bottle return thingy too. Due to my weakness, I think I talked to myself a lot more (“soup get!”) and weirded people out. Wandering the aisles, I was trying to figure out if I could eat anything, then pay for it later. But that doesn’t really work in grocery stores. I would’ve sampled some Jelly Bellies, but I doubt that would have satiated my weak shell of a body. Luckily, about halfway through the adventure, I saw that the foreign-sounding lady (“here! it’s-a very good a-pumpkin cake!”) that’s always giving away free samples at the Saline Rd Meijer had setup a pumpkin cake sample area! I ate one, and told her it was the first thing I had eaten all day. Then she gave me another! She basically saved my life, maybe. I didn’t end up buying a cake, but I did buy lots of other crap today. So thank you foreign-sounding Meijer sample lady, whoever you are!"

        "content": "So since I’ve been living alone, I’ve been buying groceries for myself. One thing I’ve been drinking more of is orange juice. I’m not quite sure why; probably because I think that if I drink high volumes of the stuff, I’ll be healthier than if I don’t. And it’s sort of worked. I think pretty much everyone in Michigan is currently sick except for me. On my weekly grocery run, I always make sure to grab at least two things of orange juice. I go through two in a week, and sometimes more. I think a 2-2-3 pattern works out nicely. Typically I just buy what’s on sale at Meijer. So far, I’ve had pretty much all brands of orange juice available. There’s Minute Maid, Tropicana, Simply Orange, Meijer brand… In short, I’ve become somewhat of an orange juice connoisseur. I never could make the distinction before between “from concentrate” and not. These days, “not from concentrate” is equal to “tastes like crap.” I’m drinking some Meijer from concentrate orange juice as I write this, and 1) It tastes pretty bad, 2) I think it’s giving me heartburn. Aside from the concentrate issue, we have things like pulp density, added vitamins, etc. There was one version of Minute Maid I bought that had some kind of weird joint drug in it… Needless to say my joints were feeling great after I drank it. Perhaps this is due to some placebo effect. Or perhaps it’s due to the fact that I’m not quite old yet. Also, there exist orange juices with an added “Omega-3” ingredient. Apparently this is good for you. But you get this ingredient from fish. Yeah, orange juice with fish in it. Not my idea of a tasty breakfast beverage. Incidentally, I think my multivitamin also has this fish stuff added. But I just swallow that whole. I guess it’s still gross, just somewhat less so. But let’s keep on track. I’m blogging about orange juice, goddamn it! When I see OJ with added vitamins or minerals, I’ll probably go for that. Calcium is good, but normal is fine too. Last week, Tropicana was on sale. But they only had the “Low Acid” and “Healthy” versions. The “healthy” one apparently had half the sugar… I got the low acid one. And it tasted really damn good! I have to wonder where the acid went after being extracted from my orange juice. I can only hope it was used for good, and not evil. Let’s get back to the pulp. I’ve been experimenting with pulp densities. So far, I’ve found that moderation is key; medium pulp works well. No pulp is just unnatural, and high pulp is just too chewy and hard to clean. Low pulp can be substituted if medium pulp is unavailable. The thing is, there’s no common pulp density measure between orange juice distributors. How high is high pulp? Only the juicers know for sure. I’ll continue experimenting with the pulp density levels until I reach, with a high confidence level, a consensus on my preference. Due to cost and time issues, I have not yet ventured into the business of “home brewing” my orange juice. I think I’ll leave that job to the professionals. While there is something to be said about one who juices his own oranges, I cannot be bothered to perfect my skill in this particular craft. In conclusion, there is no clear winner as far as orange juice brands go. I’ve only bought single brands of orange juice each week. I can say that I like Simply Orange, Minute Maid, and Tropicana. I haven’t tried the more expensive Meijer version yet. Perhaps in the future I will try a double blind orange juice taste challenge. But for now, I’ll just buy what’s on sale. I hope it’s something good this week…"

        "content": "So I got a polite (aren’t they always?) email from a recruiter at Facebook about my interview. Rejection. I guess I’m not too surprised since Facebook is everyone’s favorite company right now. Apparently there are billions of people who want to get a job/internship there, and currently, there’s like ~300 employees. So I didn’t have a very good chance from the start. Of course, my thought process immediately after reading the message went something like this: Stage 1: Retaliatory. “I’m going to create the next Facebook-killer and they’ll all regret the day they rejected me!” Stage 2: Somewhat more realistic, optimistic. “I’m going to create something they can’t help but acquire, which will be my ‘in!’” Stage 3: Realistic: “Okay, I guess I’ll just improve and maybe try again next year.” People might wonder why I’m so open to listing my rejections publicly. I think the reason is that I’m not ashamed by them; I actually tend to get motivated instead. For example, when I was rejected by Berkeley , Georgia Tech , UC Irvine and Iowa State , I decided that I’d work extra hard when I finally did begin grad school at Michigan. And I think I’ve been doing a job of getting involved academically. When I was rejected by Google , I decided I’d become a better programmer (in addition to becoming more interested in real research with stuff like social networks, etc). Plus I made MapsKrieg shortly after the rejection (mostly because I needed to find an apartment, but if I had given up on Google, I might’ve used the Yahoo Maps API instead…). Apparently I still need to work on this aspect a bit since the Facebook interview was basically a programming/algorithmic question. The “interview” was so short that I doubt anything meaningful about my abilities could have been evaluated. Sure, I didn’t prove P=NP, but I thought I did okay… I think it was a matter of the process being way too competitive (or at least, that’s how I’ll rationalize it to make myself feel better). So what does this latest rejection mean for me? It means I’ll be working a lot harder in my networks class, for one. I’m working on a fairly interesting project, so hopefully that’ll buff my otherwise slim portfolio. Facebook is the only (should I say first?) company to reject me so far for Summer internships. So I still have a few other good companies to try. In two years (more like one and a half, now), there might be a better company I’d like to work for. I still have a lot of time before I graduate, so hopefully I can become “acceptance worthy” material by then."

First, some background. There’s this old NES game called Uninvited that was ported from a mac game (I totally didn’t know this until I just looked it up). It’s a pretty simple point and click game where you’ve happened upon a strange mansion and spooky things pop up everywhere. It’s actually kind of scary, especially the part where the ghost that looks like Scarlet o’ Hara rips you to shreds if you talk to her. My dream was that I was sort of in this world. I dunno if I was playing the game, or actually in it. The point and click interface was there, regardless. I was walking around the house, and I knew that there was some kind of monster on top of the stairs. The plan would be that I’d go up the stairs, see the monster, run down and then spray it with some sleep spray or something. But the first time I just used the spray without going up the stairs and I think it killed me. So the second time (I guess I was playing the game), I went up the stairs and I don’t really remember what happened next. I remember the whole experience of playing Uninvited to be quite freaky, so this translated into the dream as well. At the time the game did have a pretty strong effect on my mental state. While it wasn’t a full blown nightmare, it did wake me up and I had to assure myself I wasn’t being eaten by a ghost or something. Oh, and the other dream I had the same night was that the old Lobos runningback, Dontrell Moore, had some kind of genetic disease and was going to die. I have no idea why I dreamed about that…"

        "content": "One of the things I’ve rediscovered in Ann Arbor is a place from my childhood. A place where you’d go in elementary school to go look up facts, and perhaps even borrow a book. And you didn’t even have to return it! Ever! That’s right, in my short time here, I’ve already rediscovered libraries. I dunno why I forgot about them. Probably because the libraries in New Mexico aren’t as good as the ones in Michigan? My local library of choice here is the Ann Arbor District Library . This library has like everything. Books, CDs, DVDs, Books on CDs. Soon they might have DVDs on Books… I found that the library had a lot of things that were on my Amazon.com wishlist , too. And Stumbling on Happiness is the book I’m going to attempt to review. Despite the title, Stumbling on Happiness is not written by Dr. Phil, as my friend Adam Torres presumed. It’s written by some psychology professor from Harvard. And it doesn’t explain how to become happy either! It sort of explains why people think they’re doing things that will make them happy, but end up not being happy. “So why did you read this, Hung!?” You might ask. Because knowing what makes people unable to become happy might provide a clue on how to actually become happy. And plus I already checked out the book, and it’s due on Tuesday, so… The general style of the book is fairly analytical, but also sort of explained in terms that normal people can understand. There’s also quite a bit of humor involved, which makes the seemingly dry task of figuring out the definition of “happiness” a bit more gratifying. One chapter starts off, “The last decade has seen an explosion of books about poop.” This is my kind of writer. While I don’t agree with everything the author says, he does use lots of real case studies and examples. Some of which seem cooked. But the main point is quite clear. People can’t predict what will make them happy because their brains aren’t really equipped to make such a prediction accurately. It’s sort of this fight against your brain’s natural reasoning capacity, and you’ll always lose. At the very end, Daniel Gilbert offers a way to escape this mental trap: phone a friend. It only works if the person is presently in the exact situation you want to be in, however, since human memory is really messed up. So really the solution is more of a cop-out. Even though I do ask people for advise a lot, I still get the feeling they are far too removed from my personal context to be accurate forecasters of my future self’s happiness. Overall, I did enjoy the book, thanks in part to the wacky humor. Though it could’ve contained a lot more. Stumbling on Happiness shouldn’t be taken as pure fact. In healthy doses, however, I think the ideas and advice within might actually prove useful to those in search of happiness. Which is like, everyone?"

In stark contrast to the Yahoo one, there were actually engineers, and they actually told us what they did, and why they liked it. Bob Trahannypoo (was that really his name?) and Jon Warman did the talking. The info session was very geared towards engineers, and I found it interesting that a lot of the stuff they talked about seemed like shared knowledge among the room. Like they’d reference f8 and just assumed we knew what that was. I got all the references, but I’m not sure about other people. Before the session, I was pretty convinced that Facebook was a solid company and seemed fun to work for. Now, I’m even more convinced. When your engineers answer questions like PR people, you know you’ve built a pretty good company culture. Also, for anyone who hates the “is” in the status updates, I asked them if they could remove it when they asked for questions. The answer I got was “no, but maybe when we internationalize the ‘is’ will go away.” So good news on that front. As far as schwag goes (it’s always a factor), I got some neat Facebook branded gum and M&amp;Ms. If I ever decide not to be lazy, maybe I’ll take pictures. On the downside, no pens, notebooks, post-its, or shirts! Come on, guys! All the Silicon Valley companies are doing it! The only thing that really sorta annoyed me was that I had tried and tried to get an interview with them. Because I’m not in the Engineering school of Michigan, I couldn’t log into their super special system. I still tried contacting the Facebook HR people but they never replied. I physically handed them my resume, so hopefully they’ll have a slot open tomorrow. I felt a bit of Engineering snobbery going on (as in, you’re nothing if you’re not an engineer), which is funny since I still consider myself an engineer (B.S. in Comp Sci == Engineer, right?). But I guess that’s the price I pay for entering the School of Information… I’m still convinced that SI is a good choice, and also that Facebook rocks. Let’s see if something good happens. EDIT: I got an interview, so it looks like I’ll be reading a bit of the algorithms book tonight."

So for example if you were a law student, you might wear a shirt that said “Michigan Law.” They’re basically available for all majors, minors, and anything else you might think of. I surmised that it would be fun to have parody shirts. Ideas I thought up, along with Adam Torres (the guy who likes being mentioned in blogs) were “Michigan Culinary,” “Michigan Blacksmith,” and “Michigan Undeclared.” But then I walked around and saw someone with a “Michigan Squirrels” shirt and figured they had beaten me to the punch. It turns out there’s a Michigan Squirrel Club that meets every Sunday at 4pm at the grad library steps. Their main mission is to feed squirrels peanuts. And they do it pretty well. There’s a squirrel call that they use to summon squirrels, and several advanced techniques like tree feeding and squirrel fishing. I attended my first meeting today and fed some squirrels. The squirrels seem to be a bit wary at first, but after a while they became more bold, even running up to us to demand a peanut. I talked with the creator and ex-president, Jason, who is also a fellow SI student. He says people are always asking about the club, and sure enough, when we were feeding squirrels, people kept on coming up to us and talking. I’m not sure how often I can make the squirrel club meetings, but I’d say it’s a fairly cool club. Also, not to brag, but the website is pretty damn bitchin’."

This is in addition to the Google talk I went to yesterday. The Google thing was sort of a meet and greet type of deal. I talked to a few people about getting internships. They gave me a tip: find someone on the inside to search for internships in a particular group, and have then forward your resume. Luckily, I have a pal from my undergrad years that will probably be willing to do this. To make up for me not getting a real prize last night, I got a $50 gift certificate for the Google Store . NICE! As usual, Google had some free food, so I got a bagel and orange juice. I sorta stayed at the Google thing for too long (The Google thing started at 12 and Yahoo at 1) so I basically missed all of Yahoo’s thing. I did ask a question, though! I asked the dude to describe the sort of hierarchy at Yahoo, as a bottom-up or top-down organization, and specifically what they do to encourage creativity. What I got was quite a bit of skirting around the issues, and not an answer to my actual question. Basically, I wanted to know if Yahoo has the same kind of culture that nurtures creativity like Google. And apparently they don’t. To be fair, the person I asked was a director of search and engineering. Way too high up to really understand what the code monkeys think. But in not answering my question, I think he answered it. Oh, and I got a notebook and pen from the Yahoo thing. That was like the most impressive thing about Yahoo. I mean, I’d still consider interning there. But their recruiting efforts need to be a lot better than this. They did give away two iPod Nanos in the course of today, but I got neither. Maybe that’s why I’m unimpressed… After that, I had a few classes. But I semi-reluctantly decided to go to a Google talk at 4: instead of my Networks lab. I know, ditching class to see a lecture… But the lecture hall was too full! So I just sat outside and tried listening to the lecture from outside the hall (there was a tv and the sound inside was being fed out with speakers). It didn’t work too well, though. Then, I was really hungry. And ready for more free food. So I went to the Yahoo thing (a sort of repeat) at 5:30. This one had free pizza. The actual presentation was quite boring (by the same dude), but the end had free shirts and I also got a rubik’s cube. So in the end, my opinion of Google is about the same, and my opinion of Yahoo is actually slightly lower. I don’t have a thing against the underdog, but they’re the underdog for a reason. Yahoo had tons of market share before Google even existed. And after Google, Yahoo’s been embarrassed on many, many fronts. Oh, and the final shwag talley for the past 2 days is: Many Google pins (some say “I’m Feeling Lucky” and some say “Google” among other things), a white Google shirt, a $50 gift certificate for the Google Store, a notepad and pen from Yahoo, another light up pen from Yahoo, a Yahoo Rubik’s cube, and a Yahoo shirt. Not too bad if you ask me."

They made me pick another guy though. So no prize for me, just another shirt. That’s cool, I like free Google shirts. If I get enough I’ll set up a “Google Week” where I wear nothing but Google shirts (and my normal jeans). Waiting for the bus back to my apartment, I encountered a huge group of engineering freshmen straight out of their first programming test. It was really nostalgic hearing people freak out about data types and assignment operators. Apparently they had a test for Engineering 101, which is C++ programming. Ah, to be a freshman again. Also worth noting was that there were girls in the group. As in, plural. Enjoy it while it lasts, guys. (I’m not a misogynist or anything, just a realist. I wish there were more girls in engineering, but the cold hard truth is there aren’t) I think I’ve finally discovered what it means to be immersed in an academic setting. I went to an organizing meeting for a social computing group at the university. We exchanged some really cool ideas and for once my attention was kept for an entire meeting! This usually never happens. I’ve also found myself starting random intellectual conversations with people. It’s all very cool and something that never happened in my undergrad years. I’ve also found myself waking up early in the morning and not being able to sleep because I was thinking. Just thinking of ideas and possibilities that would keep me awake. This has happened before when I first started exploring opportunities in web development, but it’s happening again. Which is sort of understandable, I guess. There’s so many ideas that are bouncing around in my head; from course readings to conversations to my work at the library. In short, I’m enjoying the academic atmosphere that this campus has to offer."

        "content": "So before the Michigan/Notre Dame game yesterday, I went to some “Google Tailgate” thingy. Basically, some tents were set up for people to enter and be brainwashed into the cult of Google. Or something like that. We actually arrived pretty late, but there were still free things to be acquired. Like a girl was walking around asking Google/Ann Arbor questions, and if you got it right, you’d get a maize Google shirt! I have to say, this shirt is freaking awesome. It’s wearable to game days plus it has the Google logo on it! The questions ranged from easy to difficult. I was with two other friends, and the Googlers allowed us to combine our powers to summon Captain Planet (or at least to answer questions). The first one was “What is Google’s motto?” In a mental lapse unbecoming of me, I said “Do no evil” when it’s really “Don’t be evil.” Oh well, they gave me the shirt anyway (It’d be kind of ironic for them not to, what with the motto saying not to be evil and all). The second one was “What unusual thing does Borders (in Ann Arbor) and Google allow in their buildings?” The girl gave us a hint that it wasn’t something like “books.” Since when are books unusual? I said it was probably dogs, since Google lets employees take their dogs to work. I didn’t know Borders did though. And indeed, we got shirt #2. The last question was “Who is Google’s CEO?” Who knows this crap? Well, I do, and my friend did, but we’re nerds. So we went 3/3. Thanks, Eric Schmidt! There was also a bowl ‘o pens that I ransacked (I already have a green pen from my interview, but I decided to add a blue one to my collection) and some free ice cream. One last observation: It’s pretty obvious that the Google office in Ann Arbor is an adwords office. I say this because all of the employees I saw are beautiful, beautiful people. Whereas the Googleplex has some smokin’ HR people and, well, engineering people. Note that I am not beyond calling myself an engineering person. Fin."

Objects range from the aforementioned iPhone to Tiki Torches to (my personal favorite) Halloween glow sticks. The episodes take a pretty formulaic approach. The scientist guy talks about what he’s going to blend, picks a mode (like smoothie) and blends the item. The camera shows the item being blended initially, then pans out to show the dude in an awkward position, blending the object. Once blending has commenced, the scientist dude opens the blender top. Then the phrase “_ __ smoke, don’t breath this” will occur. And the verdict? Yes, it blends! How could we for even one second doubt the blending power of Blendtec blenders!? Of course, reason that everything blends is probably due to the fact that Blendtec produces the show as well as the blenders. Still, it’s pretty damn entertaining for a random video podcast. Plus when they do change up the format, it’s awesome. Sort of like if you were watching Scooby-Doo and it turned out that the ghosts were real, or Scooby was actually a ghost, or if Velma and Daphne started making out like they did in the movie!"

I haven’t really had much free time this Summer, though. I’ve been tele-working for a company during the day. But I found some time this weekend and last weekend to get a working version of Notecentric up on Facebook. It really didn’t take much time since I had already done Notecentric once before. This was just sort of an adaptation, though Facebook has its own weird things to learn. Like redirects. Anyway, check out and install the Notecentric app . Once I get 5 users, I can apply for Notecentric to be in the official directory! So hopefully that’ll be soon. I’m planning on adding more functionality as time permits, but for now, it’s totally working. I think."

So I tried using Hpricot tonight. Apparently it’s super fast, but the documentation assumes you know a whole lot about the mating habits (internal workings) of HTML and XML. And… I don’t really. At least, not until I found this handy XPath tutorial ! After actually reading the tutorial, rather than trying to wing/hack it again, I think I have a pretty good feel for this Hpricot thing. Basically, there’s a pretty simple vocabulary for describing the nested nature of XML. It’s impossible to figure out from the Hpricot tutorials (which I tried doing for a while), but insanely simple once you just look at the tutorial.

One thing that infuriates me, however, is their use of “SEO” tricks to up their pageviews. Almost every article on the Gawker blogs will have links to “Posts tagged as” whatever, which links to a tag list. I noticed on the actual sites that they change the color of internal link to blend in, and the external links look like links. That’s good, except that I read the blogs in Google Reader. So an article ends up looking like this: Holy Crap! 8 of the 12 links on that page are directed to a fucking tag list! First of all, this is incredibly annoying. If a person clicks on a link entitled “Facebook” then maybe clicking on it should take them to FACEBOOK!!! Second, linking to internal “search results” for SEO purposes is frowned upon by Google . Of course, they’re not just doing this for the SEO, but also for crazy-insane inflated pageview stats. I was gonna write a greasemonkey script to remove the annoying links, but before I could, I found an existing one . Unfortunately it doesn’t work in Google Reader. A lot of other blogs are starting to do this, and it’s really starting to annoy me. I’m sure others are annoyed too. Maybe if enough people complain, these sites will ditch the annoying SEO tactics. Maybe we should report their evil ways to Google? If I do end up giving up reading Valleywag, at least there’s a better (yet less often updated) successor, Uncov . Long live Uncov!"

        "content": "So I’ve been getting a lot of invites to random beta things recently. The latest one is GrandCentral, a sort of central hub for your phone number. It was just recently bought by Google, which is sorta neat. GrandCentral says: GrandCentral doesn’t replace your phones; we just link them together and help them do more. How do we do that? We give people One Number…for Life – a number that’s not tied to a phone or a location – but tied to you. With GrandCentral, you can be reached with a single number, answer a call at any phone you want, seamlessly switch phones in the middle of a call, and even know whether a call is important before you take it. This idea is good in theory. My family’s had the same home phone number for like, 20+ years, and if we ever changed that number, a lot of people would instantly lose contact with us, since it’s the only thing point of contact they have. I signed up and chose a number in the 505 area code (they give you a bunch of choices and you pick one). I change cell phone service a lot, which means I usually just change the number as well. It’s always a hassle to tell everyone when my phone number’s changed. With GrandCentral, I could just change the number that my primary number forwards to. So far, the service works. I have it currently set up to ring on my cell phone, but you can also have it ring to other places as well. GrandCentral also supports things like spam filtering in case you get a telemarketer call. I think the service is interesting, but I’m not sure I want to “change” my phone number with a service that’s still in beta. Who knows how long the company will be around? The fact that Google has acquired GrandCentral is a good sign, but I’m still a bit wary of giving people this number since it’d be a hassle to change it again."

Anyway, I subscribed to the TMBG Podcast since it’s free, and they occasionally play some rare stuff from their old glory days. I just listened to their podcast 27A today, which has a crapload of demo versions of songs from John Henry. The songs are: Dirt Bike, No One Knows My Plan, I Should Be Allowed To Think, No One Knows My Plan, Out of Jail, Lullaby of Nightmares (which I think appeared on Long Tall Weekend), and A Self Called Nowhere. Unfortunately, nowhere does End of the Tour or Destination Moon show up. I guess they can’t put the whole album up… The first real TMBG album I ever heard was John Henry . Or maybe it was Flood , but I liked John Henry more. I’m probably the only person who actually likes John Henry (it’s criticized a lot!). So it’s very cool to hear demo version of the songs that I’m really familiar with. It seems like the horn players haven’t really gotten their inflections into the songs yet, and the Johns also sing a bit more reserved. If you’re one of the few TMBG fans that actually likes John Henry, I suggest you go grab the podcast and give it a listen. Incidentally, I’ve heard that their new album is good, but that might be only compared to the last two albums ( Mink Car and The Spine ) which were passable at best. I really do hope it’s good, but I’m not really in any rush to be disappointed. For now, I still pledge my Nerd Rock allegiance to Jonathan Coulton ."

I tried out all the applications and they work fairly well. The typing is alright, but when you type words that are uncommon in the dictionary, for instance, “truong,” the keyboard kinda compensates in the wrong direction. Besides that, the applications are pretty fun to use, but they seem a bit more jerky than the commercials would have you believe. For instance, I was using the google maps app and it took forever to download the map tiles! The zooming in and out using the multi touch was way cool, but it also seemed to lag behind a bit as well. I know it’ll take lag to move stuff around, but it was… how should I put it? Slower than I expected. The iPhone certainly is a cool gadget. I just don’t know why it needs to be a phone. Apple’s created a pretty sweet PDA that includes a phone, which requires a subscription fee. If they had just called it the iPDA, maybe I’d be more willing to get one. That, and if they lowered the price, made it snappier, made the battery life longer, etc. I actually had one die while I was using it in the store. The battery ran out and I had to switch to another one. Oh well, maybe in the next generation/iteration I’ll be able to afford one. And convince myself that I should pay the price for it."

Funny sidenote: when I went to Google for an interview, Peter Norvig was the special speaker dude. He had a pretty cool Hawaiian shirt on then too, as I recall. Anyway, the talk brings up some pretty interesting things, like how if you feed enough statistics to a computer, the actual algorithm matters less and less. I’ve been interested in AI and machine learning, but I never really took any formal classes. The stuff in the talk has sort of stuck in my head now. So I’m tending to see a lot of problems as being solvable by statistical analysis/classification. Like that Spock Challenge thing I blogged about earlier. Anyway, I’ve got an idea for a wacky application of Naive Bayesian Classification, but I won’t mention it yet (in case it’s an actual good idea, or in case I decide to bail after I don’t want to figure out the probability math).

I really liked it, though I never actually “plan” my TV watching, so I hardly ever see it. I just bought the DVDs so I could see the first two seasons. I think I saw like, 2 or 3 episodes from this past season. One thing I’ve noticed about House is that patients going into seizures usually mean a commercial break. I guess it’s just good TV writing to have a seizure plus fade to black… Also, the doctors really love Diazepam , which goes along with the many seizures. I remember Diazepam from Metal Gear Solid, which would help you relax to use the sniper rifle. I think a drinking game where you take a drink when a patient goes into seizure, or when House’s initial treatment fails would pretty do the job for anyone. No other rules required. So far, the series is really good. Sure, the plots get a little redundant and formulaic, but nothing like Inspector Gadget. Plus at least the characters develop. It may take me a while to watch the whole set, but I’ve got nothing but free time this Summer anyway!"

So you type in a name, or a tag, or some other query and you’re supposed to get people as results. The Spock about page says: Spock is the online leader in personal search, helping users find and discover people. With over one hundred million people already indexed and millions added every day, Spock is building the broadest and deepest people specific search engine. And that’s about all it says. Pretty sparse. I don’t even know what their actual purpose is. Is Spock for helping people stalk others? Myspace is better for that. Is it for building business connections? LinkedIn is better. Social networking? Either Facebook or LinkedIn, depending on how you’re networking. For more famous people, Spock shows a decent amount of aggregated info. Like for Eddie Murphy, you get tags, photos, and links to imdb and whatnot. For less famous people, all you get is the info that’s already available from whatever site the info was scraped from. Most peoples’ info is scraped from sources like LinkedIn or Myspace. This doesn’t really add anything useful, since you could just find those profiles on the respective sites. For example, let’s say that you want to find me on Spock. You’ll type in my name, and you’ll be presented with a bunch of Hung Truongs. You probably know something about me, so you’ll use the info that Spock has to figure out which Hung Truong is me. But since you know that much about me already, chances are, Spock won’t be telling you anything you don’t already know about me… Useless. There are already many sources to gather information about people online. Spock just aggregates this stuff and doesn’t actually add any value to the information. In addition, there’s probably all sorts of privacy issues that need to be dealt with if Spock gets to the open beta phase. Google does a good job of removing sensitive personal info if people request it. Spock might not be so kind. The most interesting thing I found while looking around at Spock was the $50,000 Spock Challenge . Basically, Spock is holding a contest to get developers to solve the problem of Entity Resolution and Extraction. EG how do you know a page is about Michael Jackson the pop singer vs the football player. I’m pretty sure the answer involves Bayesian statistical analysis. But I’m not about to spend my time to solve a problem for a startup that I don’t believe in. Oh, I have 101 invites to try out Spock. So if you want one, leave a comment and I’ll email it to you.

There’s still a lot of limitations, but I guess I can understand those since it’s basically to keep Facebook from turning into Myspace. The API is somewhat well documented, but there’s a lot of bugs. Also, the developer forums seem to have about 80% script kids, and 20% actual developers. I think the saying “RTFM” should be changed to “RTFAPID” (Read The Friendly API Docs). So yeah, if you have a Facebook account and an Amazon.com wishlist, try the app out and tell me what you think."

Oh, they let me check out the Oakland Airport website , though. But that’s not interesting. Anyway, I opened iTunes and started listening to a podcast I had saved. Some business podcast that had a guy talking about Google. He was supposed to have an insider’s scoop, but what he gave was a super high-level description of things that I already pretty much understood before. Then I noticed that there was something in the “shared music” section. I guess the airport still allowed me to get on some kind of local area network. So I was listening to this dude’s shared music (something like, Hernando Fernandez or something, I forgot his name). A lot of it was R&amp;B or random electronica. One of the artists that caught my ear was named The Fantastic Plastic Machine . I listened to a few songs before I had to start boarding. I wrote down the name of the artist for future reference though. Funny: apparently FPM is a Japanese j-pop-ish artist. So when I listen to music blindly, I choose J-Pop. It’s a bit different, though. Some now defunct company published some FPM stuff a while back. I wonder if it’d be legit to download some of the music? Otherwise I’d have to buy some out of print CDs or import… Anyway, I thought it was pretty neat to be able to discover a new artist through the kindness of a random Oakland Airport guy. Thanks!"

But Wikipedia is Google’s #4. So thanks, Mahalo. You’ve done a pretty good job of giving me GOOGLE’S SEARCH RESULTS PAGE! Oh, and if the search term you’re looking for doesn’t exist on Mahalo yet, you get Google’s search results… It’s probably just naive to think that humans can do a better job of giving relevant (up to date) search results by hand. It has to be stupidity to think that this can scale. There’s a reason that algorithms are invented. Perhaps Mahalo isn’t trying to compete with Google. But then, what is it trying to do?

I’m guessing they were on the team that did the mapping or had something to do with the street level feature. By the way, the street level views are freaking sweet!!! There’s incredible detail (you can zoom in) and every few feet there’s a 3d panorama to view. Incredible.

Today, the article was published , and luckily, I don’t really sound like a moron, per se. I figured he might mention my name and quote me or something, but he actually gave my background and stuff too! Pretty neat! Maybe I qualify as being famous now? Anyway, the article isn’t only about me (duh). It describes the increase the interest levels that schools are having in social computing programs. I was actually thinking of applying to RIT, one of the schools mentioned in the article. I was quoted as saying that social computing was more into real life applications with computer science being more ambiguous. I just checked, and indeed, I did write that! But I later elaborated, saying that the SI was more of a depth program while CS is very breadth oriented, at least at the undergrad level. I think that better captures my feelings on the differences of the programs. Computer science is a really great subject to get a foundation in working with computers: programming and algorithms. Once I got that degree, I felt like I wanted to do something more specific and less abstract. Now that I think of it, I really meant “abstract” when I wrote “ambiguous.” Oops!

My sister’s friend Juli was nice enough to pick me up from the airport and show me around the town the first day I was there. After that, I met up with Adam, another SI grad student who I met at visiting days. So me, Adam, and Adam’s wife sorta just wandered around for a few days. Let’s see… I went to Pinball Pete’s and played some kind of light gun game in Japanese starring a bunch of cats shooting at ghosts… or something like that. It was really easy, which means it’s probably a kid’s game. I beat all of the levels and then it gave me a game over thing. I walked around campus a lot. Saw stuff like the fish bowl and the cube , and other random stuff I didn’t see during visiting days. I also got my MCard, which is just the university student id card. I wore my red Google shirt, then realized I wore Ohio State colors!!! NOOOO! I might need to get them to replace it with me wearing a yellow shirt or something. I went to the Hatcher Graduate Library to finish up all of the paperwork for my job with the university. Glad that’s over with. I had to sign something and get it “notorized.” Luckily, one of the people in the administrative offices is a notary public, so I just had her “witness” me sign the paper. Of course, I also went to look at apartments. There were some pretty crappy ones and some nice ones. There was one that was super nice in the middle of Kerrytown right above a Smoothie King! But there wasn’t any parking nearby. I’m pretty sure that I’ll be going with the Nob Hill apartments , since they seem decent and they’re only about a mile away from campus. So they’re sort of a good compromise between price, distance, and quality. One of the realty companies I went to look at apartments with, Varsity Management, seemed kind of creepy. Like we just went to apartments that still had people living in them, then we knocked on the door to see if they were home. And they weren’t so we just went in. I felt like I was in some kind of cop show or something. Like I was scared there’d be bodies or dead hookers, etc. Apparently it’s part of the lease agreement, but that seems like a pretty crappy lease agreement. There’s an Ikea in Canton, which is like 20 minutes or so from Ann Arbor. We went twice. That’s how much I like Ikea. The second time we went, I even bought a few random office organization thingys. I’m probably going to Ikea again next week when I go visit my brother in California… and buy more random stuff. We also hit some pretty cool restaurants. Like umm… well, the only one I can remember is Champion House, where they do that Japanese cooking thing in front of you. It was pretty neat. Way expensive, though. But tasty. I suspect that our cook was Chinese, though, and not Japanese. Which is cool either way. And I guess that’s it. Overall, it was a pretty fun trip, though somewhat stressful due to the quality (or lack thereof) of apartments. I guess I should’ve prepared for crapiness, but still, seeing it in person is quite harsh."

It’s this program you install that acts as a sort of proxy where you can get your computer to convert and stream on demand any media that’s sitting on it. I originally had no interest in it, since when I’m away from home, I have my laptop which can provide me with videos and audio and whatnot. Just recently, I got a Motorola Q and I’ve been trying to figure out what new cool things I can do with it since it’s a smartphone. Revisiting Orb, the possibilities look promising. I just installed Orb on my computer. Basically, Orb connects with a central server. From a website, you can log in and “request” the media that’s sitting on your home computer. When you “request” something, the local program will start encoding the media at a decent bitrate and stream it to you over the web. It’s pretty cool, actually. When I used my phone to try and grab stuff, videos were a bit low (my phone only gets like 78kbs in Albuquerque), but audio was ok. When I move to Ann Arbor, the bitrate should improve by a lot, since there’s EVDO coverage there. When I plugged my phone into the computer and used the local connection, the videos were surprisingly high quality. It was really cool watching a video on my phone like that. I probably won’t use it much while I’m here, but once I get to Ann Arbor I’d like to test the feasibility of watching tv shows on my phone from anywhere. There is an issue of privacy since you allow the Orb software to index all of the files on your computer and list them online (it’s password protected). The privacy terms seem okay though. I’d prefer a totally direct method of connection though, instead of relying on Orb to keep my privacy. Not that I’m doing anything illegal. It’s the principal of the thing."

I’m sure they need engineers to run Adwords too, but who knows if they’ll put them in that office. I also read this funny comparison about why you should work at Meetup instead of at Google . The document (made on Google Docs!) mainly tries to convince readers that working at Meetup is much cooler since it’s a startup. It seems like they push the “you’re a cog in the machine at Google” a bit too hard, though. There’s also the “Google infantilizes you” thing goin’ on too. Perhaps that’s true, but I for one welcome our Google parenting overlords! I’m sure that document is all in good fun, anyway. At the end of the day, people are reminded of how awesome Google’s toilets are, and Meetup gets some free publicity."

Well, you should already know who your friends are… But if this person is a friend of a friend, Facebook tells you that as well! This is really cool (and something craigslist lacks) because you automatically have a way to determine if the seller is legit, without using lame feedback methods like Ebay does. At least, hypothetically, your friends should know legit people… It’ll be interesting to see how successful the marketplace will be. While it may be fun getting random stuff from strangers with craigslist, it’d seem like a better idea to actually know who that couch belonged to before using it… Also, I think it’s hilarious that Facebook decided to release this like a day after Oodle launched a sponsored group featuring its own classified ads.

What you could include is a description of why the site was created, how it works, what your plans are, etc. You are allowed to include max 2 links to your site and 1 picture. It should be a good way to gain visibility online. Normally we charge between 30 and 160$ for a review, but because of the quality of your website we will be happy to publish your own text on businesshackers.com.

Anyway, I tried to think of a few ideas for mini-apps using the API, and today I finally got around to messing with it. I hit a roadblock pretty quickly, though. Apparently Facebook’s API will let you find all of the current user’s friends, but it won’t let you see all of the friends of any other user. This seriously limits the capabilities of the API by a whole lot. This sort of makes sense. If the API let you see more than a logged in user could, that user could theoretically get past privacy setting that are in place. However, the API just blocks all queries that try to find all friends of anyone other than yourself. When logged in, you can see this info, so I don’t see the harm in offering it in the API. What this means is that there’s no way to really “traverse graphs” with the API. You only get info on the user’s immediate friends. Thus, any application using the API is really only rehashing or using data that is already available on the main site. That’s fine for simple applications that can sync your address book to Facebook or let you rate how hot your friends are. But Facebook is a social networking site. The interesting applications require some kind of access to the graph data of the site. It’s really disappointing to see that the API limits this so much. I really would’ve liked to see a bit more capability with the Facebook API. If Facebook really wants developers to come up with interesting and complex applications, I’d suggest opening it up a bit more."

On Twitter and Facebook, you can write updates on what you’re doing, either from your phone or your computer. I think the difference is that Twitter sends updates to your friends on what you’re doing by SMS or whatever. Facebook just sorta posts your status on the site. Now, I actually use the Facebook updates now and then, but it seems like people who use Twitter do this to the max. Like they update multiple times a day. Are these people so self-centered that they think everyone needs to know what they’re doing? I think the difference between this functionality in Facebook and in Twitter is this: In Facebook, it’s just that. A functionality. In Twitter, the ability to update is the entire application itself. To me, Twitter is simply a subset of what Facebook already provides. Why would you ever need both? The only thing I can see that Twitter does better is leaving out the required “is” that facebook stick in the updates. So I can write “Hung Truong likes cheese” rather than “Hung Truong is liking cheese.” Screw gerunds! Regardless, Twitter seems to be insanely popular. At least with web 2.0 blogs. For now I’ll stick to updating with Facebook, like every few days or so…"

If you haven’t read my previous posts on MapsKrieg, it’s a mashup that scrapes craigslist apartment listings and displays them using the Google Maps API. I’ve been on the hunt for an apartment in Ann Arbor, MI where I’m going to go to grad school. I had seen the coolness of HousingMaps , but I noticed that it only supported a very small number of cities. I figured I’d build a similar app that listed more cities, since craigslist has expanded quite a bit since that HousingMaps was created. If you’re wondering about the name, here’s my thought process: I was originally calling the project “Craigsmaps” since that sort of made sense. But the domain name for that name is already taken. So I came up with a bunch of other stupid Web 2.0 names that didn’t really click (Abodr, apartment.icio.us (okay, just kidding)). So I switched the “craig” and the “maps” and it became “mapscraig” which reminded me of “blitzkrieg” which became “mapskrieg.” And there you have it. Currently MapsKrieg supports 286 different craigslist locations. I haven’t added any areas outside the United States, though if I get requests, I’ll add them. And I’ll probably add new cities as their added to craigslist if people request them, too. As far as technical stuff goes, I built the site on the CakePHP framework, which was a new experience for me since I had been doing stuff in Ruby on Rails for the past year. The app uses Google Maps’ API for displaying the data that’s pulled directly from craigslist listings. Of course, all the data is cached in a MySQL database, so the site is decently fast. MapsKrieg took about two “man weeks” worth of time to complete. It was developed over about a month, though I didn’t work on it every day, and I didn’t work all day on the days I did work on it. I’d say that’s pretty good, considering I hadn’t really done much programming in PHP/Javascript before, and I had to learn the Google Maps API (which was surprisingly easy). Anyway, go ahead and try out MapsKrieg and let me know what you think. The interface could probably use some tweaking, but I think the app “works” fairly well. But I’m open to any questions or comments."

I was using thickbox to get some pretty snazzy ajax stuff going on for displaying the about page and whatnot. Today, I included prototype for some even more snazzy ajax stuff. But apparently they clash. I guess both of them like using the ‘$’ character as a shortcut to make the code easier to read. Which means they have crazy namespace conflicts. Bad developers! Anyway, here’s how I got it to work. Right after the import of the jquery library, I set the ‘$’ thing to be ‘$j’ instead. Then I refactored thickbox to use the ‘$j’ name instead. It worked. Here’s what the head looks like: &lt;br /&gt; ...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/jquery-latest.pack.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;script&gt;var $j = jQuery.noConflict();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/thickbox.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/prototype.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ...&lt;br /&gt;"

I mostly spent yesterday buying the domain name, upgrading my server, and getting the project to work on my “production” server. It wasn’t too difficult; I just needed to move the database, change some names, and make sure there weren’t any old names being used. I also started adding all of the cities on CraigsList to the database. At least, the US ones. This took a lot of time to do manually. I had to figure out if the area was an actual city, or a bunch of cities, then figure out the geo coordinates, and stuff it into the database. I thought it might be faster to do it by hand than write a script. Nope. Today I wrote a script that would make the entry faster by automagically getting the coordinates from Google Maps’ http request service. It still took a while, but today I finished inserting almost all of the US cities (excluding the combination ones, since Google can’t do those). Now all that’s left is for me to make the pop up windows a little prettier, and maybe add a list of the CraigsList listings to the side for easy browsing by price, # of bedrooms, etc. That shouldn’t take too long. Then I can launch the site!"

This required a bit of more javascript and some template files, etc. I did a little research on the person who did the Google Maps Craigslist mashup like two years ago. Apparently he got a job at Google! While that’s pretty awesome, I can’t see this project doing the same for me, since it’s something that’s already been done (and two years ago, which is an eternity in web time). Rather, I’m just building this for my own use and perhaps for other people who wish there were more cities available in that HousingMaps mashup. I came up with a name for the application. I was going to call it CraigsMaps, but someone already has that domain name. I’m thinking I should buy the domain name pretty soon, but what if I come up with a cooler name later!? The app should be ready in a couple of days anyway. Depending on how much extra stuff I want to cram in before I “launch” it."

After doing some CSS to overlay some divs over the Google Map, I found out there’s another way to do this: with “custom controls.” The way that the custom controls work is both pretty sweet, and not that great. I don’t like having to add content to them by using javascript. It just doesn’t seem “correct” to do so, since I’m just overlaying normal html. So I’ll be using some custom controls, and some divs. The good thing about custom controls is that the map knows not to open infowindows under them when they’re opened up. Besides that, I just did a lot of random work on getting the app to look a little better. Like showing the correct area based on which city’s listing you want to see. Overall, the project is coming along really smoothly, with very few roadblocks. I’m happy that it’s nearing completion. I really enjoy doing these one-man projects, since it lets me get experience in everything from database schema planning and optimizing, to php backend development, to designing the css for the content, and even maybe a little tweaking in the Apache server. I think once I add this project to my “real” server, I’ll need to get a ram upgrade. I think the project should probably be ready to go live within a week. I dunno if I’ll actually try to get the word out, or just release it and see if people find it via Google or something. That’d be cool. Since there’s already a site that does a similar thing (though there’s a smaller number of supported cities), I don’t think what I’m doing is really that noteworthy. I think it’d be useful, though, so we’ll see if there’s any reaction at all to it."

Punch Out is one of those games that I can still enjoy playing, even after like 20 years! I can’t believe it’s that old! I can’t believe I’m that old! Anyway, I used my credit card to buy some Wii Points and downloaded Punch Out! This is the version with Mr Dream, not Mike Tyson… Speaking of changes, I was on Wikipedia like last week looking at Punch Out stuff (totally unrelated). Apparently “ Soda Popinski ” used to be called “Vodka Drunkenski” in the arcade version. How awesome is that!? I got to Bald Bull before I actually lost. That dude is a bitch. I remembered how to defeat his bull charge, but let’s just say I was a little rusty. I finally beat him, but then I couldn’t beat Piston Honda in the next league or whatever. I’ll try again later. I remember that when I was a kid, that was also the part I gave up. I guess some things don’t change… Also, the new Wiimote isn’t the best controller to play Punch Out on, but it sure as hell beats the original NES controller. I like to call that old controller “The Blister Machine!” Seriously, it hurt. I hope they release Super Punch Out for the SNES for the virtual console soon. That game was really awesome, too.

I was having a hard time getting the map to show up in the div with a few of the css layouts I downloaded, so I just decided to code it by hand. I think it looks pretty neat; the map stretches across the whole screen and then the other content is shown in absolutely positioned divs. I also did some stuff with the CakePHP helpers. CakePHP’s inferiority to Rails is really starting to show to me. I think it’s all a product of PHP having not been created for this kind of MVC design. CakePHP tries to follow the conventions of Rails, but it does so in a sort of copycat manner. As such, the result does not meet or exceed the original. In the case of Helpers, Rails automagically links the named helper to the controller. In CakePHP, you must specify that a certain controller uses a certain helper. It’s kind of annoying. There also isn’t any support for the Rails convention of “partials,” which is why I’m using their helpers to begin with… It’s annoying. Also, I find it annoying that CakePHP finds an objects associated objects by default when using “find()” or “findAll().” It’s useful when I want it, but when I don’t, it wastes a lot of memory! Now that I think of it, I’m not sure if Rails does this by default or not. The only reason I mention it is because I kept getting out of memory errors (or more accurately, memory limit errors) with my application. It’s a big waste when all I want is the name of the area and CakePHP fetches ALL of the associated listings for that area… I must sound really whiny right now. I guess it’s just from some frustration in learning a new language/framework instead of using one that I’m used to. It’s good for me, I won’t argue against that. It’s just a bit disappointing to see all of these flaws when a framework is purported to be things like “stable” and “good.” Oh, and also, I should say that I think my actual mashup is coming along pretty nicely. It should be ready in a few more “days,” where a “day” is one I am actively working on the mashup. I could probably “release” it pretty soon, but usually when I release something, it means I won’t work on it much anymore, moving to something else I find interesting. So I should probably actually have it done before I release it…"

He also has a bunch of other really neat songs, like Skymall , which is about those catalogs you find in the airplane seats that feature gigantic crossword puzzles , and Ikea , which is about the bitchin’ furniture store that my entire family loves. I read somewhere that Sweden trusts Ikea more than their own government. Which means that either Ikea is awesome, or the Swedish government is horrible. The coolest song I found so far (I haven’t listened to all of the MP3s yet) is a mashup of “25 or 6 to 4”, and “When I’m 64.” The vocals of the latter spliced with the background of the former makes for a really cool, melancholy sound.

Besides that, I got the interface to what it was previously, except with AJAX so that the Craigslist images are only downloaded when you click on a map marker. I also found that it takes a long time to put a week’s worth of listings (from Ann Arbor, at least) onto the map at once. I’m guessing there were at least 400 on there. I made a hard limit to the number of listings that show up, and it loads a lot faster now. I’m sort of back into the mood for working on this project again.

This meant it would poll Craigslist like a billion times in one second to get all of the images preloaded. Guess what? Craigslist doesn’t like that. They put a ban on me (and anyone else who would use the badly implemented map) after loading one page. Luckily it was only a temporary ban. My solution was to use AJAX to load the tabbed info windows for the markers on demand. So no pictures or anything get loaded until you request them. It’s much nicer to Craigslist, though I don’t know if it’s friendlier to my server, since there’ll be more requests. That’s okay, though. It was kind of a pain to learn how to grab the xml files and parse them, but I finally got it working. Now all I have to do is generate the xml files for each listing (shouldn’t be hard at all). I’ve already got experience generating xml from the RSS feeds that I make for Notecentric and Anime Nano . Plus, I get some street cred (maybe) for including AJAX in the site! It’s a requirement of Web 2.0, so I figure I should fulfill it."

Googlers are allowed to be on social networks, right? But Google has a social network of their own, Orkut ! To be fair, Orkut is very popular with Brazilians (for some reason), but it has yet to catch on in North America. But shouldn’t Orkut be popular among Googlers? It is, after all, a product that’s made by their own company. I tried to find an “official” Google group on Orkut. Of the Googlers that I know (okay, like one), they’re either in the “Google (863)” group or the “Google (1,301)” group. Keep in mind that on Orkut, anyone can join the Google group, whereas on Facebook, you must have a valid Google email to join. To be nice, let’s just call the one with 1,301 members the “official” Googler group. This means that Orkut has 1,301 Googlers vs. Facebook’s 2,041… ouch. I think this just illustrates my belief that Google really needs to put some work into Orkut to make it a viable social network. Right now, I think they’re just sort of letting it sit there. It’s really uncharacteristic of a Google product, and it’s something that’s surprised me ever since I found out that Orkut was owned by Google. How can Google do this? Give Orkut some personality! Right now it’s incredibly dull to use. I think the reason people use Facebook (at least, the reason I do) is that it’s fun. Facebook has random crap that doesn’t make logical sense, but is fun anyway (like poking). That’s why I really like Facebook as a social network, and why I think it’d be a fun company to work for. The work atmosphere at Google is incredibly fun, which is why I can’t understand why Orkut is so boring. Even Myspace lets users customize the layout. Though this is bad for the eyes, users like it. This isn’t so much of an attack on Orkut than it is a wake-up call. I really think that with the resources that Google has, they could create a great social network. Right now it’s wasting away. And to end on a fun note, here’s a joke that I found on Valleywag : Orkut Büyükkökten, creator of the Google social network that bears his name, dashes into CEO Eric Schmidt’s office and says, “We have a million Brazilian users!” Eric says, “Keep up the good work.” After Orkut leaves, Eric calls VP Marissa Mayer and asks, “How many is a brazillion again?”"

Super Paper Mario is different from the other Paper Mario games in a big way. The RPG elements have been pretty much removed. Now, instead of taking turns attacking and defending, Mario just attacks the enemies in real time. So it’s more like the original Super Mario, except with hit points and stats. I’m not too happy with this, since I liked the RPGness of Paper Mario. I thought Paper Mario was just an extension of the old Super Mario RPG games. Now that they’ve got rid of the RPG, it’s just not as fun. The graphics are pretty neat though. There’s this thing where you flip from 2D mode to 3D mode. It’s like going from a flat world to three dimensions. You can find hidden stuff and avoid the 2D enemies in 3D mode. The humor is still intact, too. There’s a lot of references to the original Super Mario Bros. game. There’s even the super mushroom that turns you into a giant version of the pixellated Mario. Super Paper Mario is still fun, but I have a feeling it would’ve been better if they had kept the gameplay from Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door intact."

Apparently Facebook added that requirement some time after April 2nd and, presumably, getting a lot of inefficient entries (mine included). It’s also funny to note that if you look at the actual html, there’s a fun message hidden in comments that reads “with ‘efficient’ meaning whatever you think it ought to mean.” Touché, facebook, touché. Off the top of my head, I can think of a way using dynamic programming to make the problem a lot more efficient. I’m not sure whether or not it’s just an amortization hack, or an actual better than O(n) implementation, technically. Okay, so I went ahead and coded up the dynamic programming version. The running time actually does increase at a less than O(n) rate, so I think it counts. Maybe I’ll plot out the running time growth for good measure. I believe it’s in the neighborhood of log(n).

I spent most of my time switching out from a random php output file to a CakePHP setup. I haven’t ever used CakePHP before, but I have used Ruby on Rails quite a bit. CakePHP is sort of like PHP’s answer to rails. It copies a lot of the ideas and conventions that Ruby on Rails expects developers to follow. Because of the similarities between CakePHP and Rails, I found it pretty simple to migrate the PHP I already had to CakePHP. I just had to learn the proper syntax to get everything working in Cake. I still think Ruby is a really beautifully simple language to write code in. Cake tries to get things looking Ruby-ish, but there’s still some weirdness involved. It’s good for me to be learning these PHP things anyway, though. I’ve put PHP on the backburner for too long. Tomorrow, if I have time to work on the project, I think I’ll implement the actual UI side of things. I have a rough idea of how I want users to be able to interact with the site.

When I ran the new Michigan parsing script by going to the page from a web browser, the thing would run fine, but after I uploaded to the server and ran it from the command line, it would flip out. It took me a really long time to figure out, but it turns out that I was calling a separate function by passing a value and not a reference. I actually thought this might be a problem when writing the function, but when it worked, I forgot about the issue momentarily. The weird part is that the function works fine when you hit the .php file from a browser, and not when you run it from the command line. It must be some setting in the environment… Besides that minor problem, everything seems to be going along smoothly. PHP has a lot of nice built in functionality for doing string manipulation, which this project has a lot of. It’s also got really nice networking and file reading capability. I guess that makes sense, since it originally came about as a tool for creating websites. Tomorrow I’ll try to get the mashup site setup with actual options and navigation. Right now it’s just set on Ann Arbor. I’ll have to do some routing to get the many different options that people might want set up."

Basically I worked on adding the individual listings onto the Google Map with stuff like the description, address, and price. At first I thought about importing the points from some kind of xml document, but I figured the approach with just embedding it was easier. Then I figured out how to start scraping some of the listing info from the Michigan off campus housing site. This site seems to have better listings in terms of quality and price. I think today I’ll work on getting all of that info into the database so I can map it as well."

I spent a lot more time getting the data that I scraped from the individual Craigslist ads into the database, and then setting up the cron script thing to periodically pick up the new feeds. To parse the RSS feeds, I just used Magpie since it was really easy. Magpie wouldn’t parse the KML files that Google Maps uses to do its geocoding thing (where it gives you the latitude and longitude based on an address) so I had to use a regular expression. It was a pretty ugly hack, but at least it got the job done. I suppose it’s more efficient to use regular expressions rather than a full blown parser though. Maybe. I also got the database info for the apartment ads into Google Maps using their API. It’s actually pretty simple once you understand what all the lines mean. I’m sort of weak in Javascript, so I guess this is a good chance for me to learn some more. I know Java, but I’m not used to using things like event listeners for mouse clicks and stuff like that. GUI? Who needs ‘em, right? So I’ve got a sort of working prototype. Now all I need to do is clean it up and add more prettiness and features. Right now when you click on the map marker, you just get the description. Hopefully I can add stuff like the price, a link to the Craigslist listing, and pictures. It shouldn’t take too long, now that I’ve got the skeleton in place."

Which is to say now. A while back, some guy made a mashup of Craigslist and Google Maps. HousingMaps shows a giant google map with pushpins corresponding to communities on Craigslist. I think this was one or two years ago. Since then, other communities have been added to Craigslist, but the person who wrote this site hasn’t updated anything. Guess what? Ann Arbor isn’t one of the communities supported by HousingMaps. So I figured it’d be a good exercise in coding (in PHP and some javascript for the Google Maps component) for me to do something similar. Sure, I’m not doing anything very original, but at least I’ll learn something, and I think it’ll be difficult enough without being impossible. So far, I’ve gotten the important chunks of info parsed out of the individual Craigslist listings. Note to Craigslist: Your HTML is horrendous. It is formed: horribly. Okay, so maybe it’s not that bad, but it’s certainly not semantic . Honestly, figuring out how to parse this very crappily formed HTML took some crazy logic, but I think it came out okay in the end. Next, I’m going to have to figure out putting these listings into the database (shouldn’t be that hard), so that they can populate the map. After that, adding stuff to the map and getting the map to do what I want. Now, sleep."

As in programming wise and computationally too. The Prime Bits problem seemed pretty easy (as in, doable in about an hour) so I did it. I guess I’ll just send it to Facebook and tell them that I’m looking for a Summer internship or something. The only thing is, it seems like the puzzle is too easy. What if they use this puzzle as some kind of red herring to capture lazy programmers in order to blacklist them? Or maybe there’s a way to be clever that I didn’t think of? I’ll probably send it anyway. It only took me like an hour. It’s probably mostly just to see what peoples’ programming styles are like (OOP, functional, etc.). What’s the point of my post?

        "content": "[ Edit 11-13-2010 Hi Techcrunch! This is an old post I made more than 3 years ago about Google. tl;dr I interviewed and didn’t get a job. I’ve done some stuff since then. Check me out on LinkedIn and look at my portfolio . I’m currently looking for interesting stuff to do. And now back to this lengthy post about Google…] So last Thursday I flew out to Google to visit in the context of their College Days program to do some interviews / take a tour of the Googleplex and eat their food. Google had me sign a pretty hefty NDA (Non-disclosure agreement) so I’ll try to be careful with what I say. Basically, I believe that if what I say is pretty much common net knowledge, I’ll be ok. I don’t really think they told me any Google secrets. The main point of the NDA, I think, is not to reveal any of the interview questions, since they’re important to keep under wraps so that interviewees will see them as fresh questions instead of being coached on them. So on Thursday, I flew out to a very nice hotel called The Grand Hotel in Sunnyvale, CA. It was very nice. The bathroom was really huge. The bed was really huge. I felt pampered from the very beginning. They even had a bathrobe! Upon arriving, I used Google Earth (quick plug!) to find some fast food places nearby. I walked to Taco Bell and back and had some burritos for dinner. I took a mineral bath (to calm down for tomorrow’s interview) and tried to sleep, but that was kind of hard to do, considering. The next morning, I woke up semi-early to eat a light breakfast. I realized that I forgot to bring deodorant (which is kind of a big deal) so I walked about three blocks to get to a drug store. These were no ordinary blocks, however. These were Sunnyvale blocks! I got back to the hotel and applied the deodorant (which at that point, I urgently needed due to the walk). I didn’t have much time, so I ran down to the lobby to find that the hotel’s limo had already departed for Google! Me and a couple of other candidates were freaking out (but not too terribly badly) but we then realized that the limo would come back for us. It was pretty cool riding in the limo. It didn’t have champagne or a pool or anything though. The first thing that I saw upon arriving to Google was a ping-pong table. Cool! We introduced ourselves to the recruiters and relations people, and listened to a quick talk from Peter Norvig , who is now a research director at Google. I’m not really into AI, so I didn’t know who he was, but one of the other college day visitors was studying AI as a PhD so he was pretty stoked. After that, we did three interviews in a row which were 45 minutes each and done by different engineers at Google. One of the things that sets Google apart from other companies is that it seems to like having fun. As an example of this, all of the interview rooms were named after programming languages. There were all sorts of languages, including some I’d never heard of before. I thought the interviews went pretty well. There were some hard problems (NP-Complete hard even) and some easier problems. I did have sort of a hard time writing down the code, since I hadn’t done any formal code in Java for quite some time. I guess that during my second interview, I chose a weird way of solving the problem that sort of confused the interviewer, but other than that, I thought I did well. After the interviews, we had lunch. We ate at Charlie’s Cafe, which had a bunch of types of food. I guess the special that day was seafood. One of the nice things is that each dish was labeled with 0, 1 or 2 asterisks. They went from 0 – not vegetarian, 1 – vegetarian, 2 – vegan. Since I’m a vegetarian, it’s nice to see this kind of thoughtfulness. It sure helps choosing food when you don’t have to ask “does this have meat in it?” for each dish. The food was pretty good, but I got a seriously burned Focaccia which I didn’t finish. After that, we had a game of Google Trivia for Google prizes, and some massages. The recruiters were evidently not engineers. One question (I think I can reveal these since they’ll never ask them as interview questions) was how much is a googol? One person said “10^100” and the recruiters were like, what? Then one guy said “1 followed by 100 zeroes” and the recruiters were like, correct! Then we had to explain that the first guy got the question right first. After that we had a Q&amp;A session with two Google engineers. One worked on Google Earth and the other had created Google Movies as a 20% project. I asked a question about doing grad school + Google and the answer was that it was really hard. They seemed like really nice people, and it was reassuring to see that the engineers of Google can be social (unlike many engineers in general). The last thing of the day was the Google Tour. We walked around and saw all of the weird, quirky things that makes Google Google. Like the T-Rex skeleton , and the volleyball court that had sand imported from Mexico, or the micro-kitchens that you come across every 150 feet or so, or those infinity pools where there’s a constant current pushing against you. One thing that I noticed was that there was a lifeguard there. Just watching one guy swimming in the very small pool. Finally, we said goodbye to all of the recruiters and took the limo back to our hotel. The general vibe of the place was that Google is still the place to work. I don’t think there is a work environment like it anywhere else (besides all of their other offices). The culture still seems fun, the atmosphere seems creative, and I really want to work there. As it so happens, I didn’t get offered a job. The recruiter tried calling me yesterday but I was probably in the air when she tried. I called her today and she gave me the bad news. So it looks like most likely I’ll be going to grad school at Michigan. Hopefully I can find a good way to pay for tuition; maybe a research assistantship, a position as ULA, or something else. I can still try again after about a year. Since I’m planning on grad school it’ll probably end up being in two years. When I asked if there was any feedback I could hear about my interviews, the recruiter told me that in a high level sense, coding was an issue. I suppose I should have studied my OOP a bit more (I’ve gotten a bit rusty). It is frustrating since I honestly believe that I could make an impact on the projects that are going on at Google. I see this as a false negative, but I really have no one to blame but myself for it. I do hope I can come back after I’ve completed grad school and try again at Google. There’s really nowhere else I can see myself ending up. This is a small defeat for me, but I know that I can definitely make myself a better candidate with hard work and guts! Also, the visit itself to Google was invaluable. I had the chance to visit my favorite company and literally eat with the people who were making the company what it is. I actually look forward to interviewing with Google again in the future. The interviews were all very interesting and I was treated very well. Hopefully I can do better the next time. My consolation prize"

        "content": "After my Google Visit, I left early on Saturday morning to fly to Michigan. Michigan is my top (and sadly, only) school right now as far as graduate school possibilities go. It’s okay though, because I think Michigan would be my top school even if I was admitted to all the schools that I applied to. I arrived to the school somewhat late. I missed the registration and about half of the introduction talk. I sat down at a table whose occupants were librarians. Pretty much everyone there was an LIS (library and information services) specialist. This wasn’t really a great first impression, since I applied under the HCI (human-computer interaction) specialization, and to be honest, libraries aren’t really my thing. Not to say that I don’t like them, but the people there just didn’t have the same interests as me. After dinner, we broke into groups with current SI students leading the way. I went with the group that promised a song and dance routine, though unfortunately, they were only kidding. We went to Cafe Ambrosia , where I didn’t actually get anything. Instead, some random person walked up to me and said “hey, are you my room mate?” Indeed, I was his room mate. I hadn’t met him before since I was totally late. Anyway, Adam and I started chatting about stuff outside the cafe while everyone else was talking inside the cafe. I guess we should’ve stayed inside, but whatever; we had a good chat. The next day, we woke up to a crazy hell alarm! Like seriously, the alarm was very dissonant, and for a second, I thought I had woken up in some kind of hell. Adam thought it was scary, too. We went to get breakfast in the really snobby restaurant of the Bell Tower hotel. By snobby, I mean they played Canon in D without even thinking about it. Then we went to the West Hall for some lectures. Like we had a few professors talk about what the program at SI was all about and some of the details of what we’d be expected to do at SI. Of special note was the PEP system , where each student is expected to do some “Practical Engagement” before he/she graduates. After that, there were a few information sessions about the varying specializations. I chose to go to the HCI information session, then the introduction to the new MSI specializations, of which social computing is very interesting to me. I really wish the introductions to the new specializations would have lasted longer. It felt really rushed, and before we knew it, it was time for lunch. For lunch, we walked to the Michigan League building and sat down at specified tables. We were paired up with faculty who had the same interests as us. Our table featured Thomas Finholt , a dean of research at the information school. We had some cool candid conversations regarding the new dean of the school of information. He also discussed the differences between the mentalities of the professors at Michigan vs. those at Carnegie Mellon, who both have very highly respected HCI programs but very different way of approaching it. I also would have liked to talked to Paul Resnick , the faculty coordinator for the Social Computing specialization. I think I’ll email him separately with my questions on the subject. After lunch we had a lot of lectures. I hadn’t gotten much sleep the night before, and I just had lunch, so it was really tough not sleeping through them. Not to say they weren’t full of useful information, but at that point I was kind of information’ed out. This is a School of Information , though, so I guess I should’ve expected it. There was a talk about career services (of which the SI actually has its own department), a panel of alumni and their experiences, and a presentation about financial aid opportunities. Afterwards, we again broke off into groups, going to local eateries and whatnot. I followed the SAA around the whole night due to their excellent choice of venues. I probably should’ve gone with the HCI group, but I didn’t want to go to the Japanese place and have nothing to eat (seafood = gross!). The SAA people were nice too, though. Finally, the next day I had time to attend the employment information fair over at the Michigan League. I had a chance to meet the people who had interviewed me for the ULA position over at the Public Health and Informatics Library. They seemed really nice and even tried drawing a map to the library for me until we decided I’d probably get lost and miss my flight. Hopefully I’ll be chosen for that position since it seems like a way cool opportunity to affect some real changes in a real life library. Overall, my impressions of SI were sort of mixed, but still really positive. I knew coming in that the school was very interdisciplinary, but I didn’t realize the degree to which it was. There was a statistic thrown around that 100 people were visiting this weekend, and they represented around 50 undergraduate concentrations! I thought that for sure there would be more CS majors around, but I only ran into one or two. In a way, I felt uncomfortable due to the lack of other CS people. Hardly anyone I had met had any experience with programming, and I think they had some misconceptions about programming and programmers in general. I guess I could say I also have misconceptions about librarians and archivists too, though. It didn’t really bother me that much, but I definitely felt as though I was in an intellectual minority as far as undergraduate interests went. This kind of intellectual dissonance made me unsure as to whether or not the coursework at SI could really challenge me and if I would actually learn anything there. I have been slightly reassured by looking at the coursework. For example, the Design of Complex Websites course is offered in Ruby on Rails. It’s very cool that the school is able to give a course like this, even though I already know Ruby on Rails fairly well. Many of the other courses, like Recommender Systems and Game Theory sound very interesting as well. I am a little worried that the courses might be too “soft” for me because of my CS background. I have a feeling that as long as I actively try to get as much out of a class as possible, I will learn something. Hopefully the professors can push me and I can push back. In the end, I’m probably just being a CS snob about it and I have a feeling my worries will go away quickly after taking a few classes. I wish we had a chance to attend a course or two to see what they were like, though that would’ve been pretty difficult to arrange, I imagine. I think that more importantly, the people I met this past weekend were very cool. The faculty all seems very nice and intelligent. Apparently Judy and Gary Olson are superstars in the field of HCI. I also met some really cool potential peers who are very intelligent and show a lot of passion and potential in their interests. I think that other intangibles will make Michigan a very worthwhile experience for me if I choose to attend. During the alumni panel, it was said that Michigan has the largest alumni base in the entire United States. Though it seems a bit unfair, a few alumni talked about how their job search replies were post-scripted with “Go Blue!” at the end. Being a Michigan alumni probably doesn’t mean instant employment anywhere you want, but I’m sure it helps at least a bit. I’ll have to wait for a reply from Google and the ULA program before I make a final decision. I’m very happy that between my two choices, I see a huge deal of potential. I think either choice will be a good one for me; it’s definitely a win-win situation. Despite my few remaining reservations about the program, I am really stoked about possibly going to Michigan for grad school."

Or vice versa, the mat could act as some kind of barrier, with people seeing “Go away” as they’re about to enter, and “Come in” when they’re ready to leave. Theoretically, no one would enter or leave the house, which would create a state of home equilibrium, perhaps. Unless there are other entrances… There’s also a doorhanger , in case you need to signal to people whether it is acceptable to enter a particular room."

It comes with a bunch of minigames, much like Wii Sports, but they’re not all sports. Out of the nine, I’d say 3 or 4 are actually fun to play. The Shooting Range game is not Duck Hunt, which makes me sad. Basically you just shoot stuff. Sometimes the Duck Hunt ducks will fly by and you can shoot them, but otherwise you just hit targets. Find Mii is lame, unless you enjoy finding people in crowds. Table Tennis is really weak, because you can only control the horizontal action of the paddle. Tennis in Wii Sports is about 100 times better, and it comes with the Wii when you buy it! Pose Mii is also pretty boring. Laser Hockey is actually very fun. The graphics are cool, and who doesn’t like air hockey? I need to get a friend to play this one with me, since the CPU is kind of dumb. Billiards is good too. It’s not quite ready to be its own game, but I enjoyed it (and I actually played it more than once). Fishing is worthless. This looks like a tech demo. An unfun tech demo. Charge is kind of okay, and very surreal. I like how it uses the wiimote, at least. Tanks is also very fun with the nunchuck. I imagine getting 4 players would make this very, very fun. In the end, if you’re looking to get an extra wiimote anyway, then Wii Play isn’t a bad buy. If you already have enough controllers, I don’t think it’s worth $50 for the game. There’s some good games, and there’s some not so good games. I personally think Wii Sports is more fun. Laser Hockey might be worth $10 by itself though."

So I had to statically write the menu bar thing so it showed the active menu item for each page. A lot of code was repeated, and it was generally pretty ugly. I figured it’d be a good exercise to redo that simple site in a php template of sorts. So I used this pre-existing templating class and modified it for my needs. Yeah, I’m still manipulating other peoples’ code, but at least in this case, the code is simple enough so that I understand how all of it works (I haven’t taken the time to go digging around in all of WordPress’ source yet). Unfortunately the class was really simple, and it still couldn’t handle my dynamic menu bar list thing. So I wrote a quick class called Menubar and it works! You can see the php version of my professional website at this location . I might end up just making it the official one, once I know it’ll work ok. It was a bit of work, and I didn’t really change anything to the actual site, but if I ever end up adding another section, it’ll be a lot less work than before.

You can also bump the world so the ball can jump. When the ball eats red flowers, it can grow. You can also blow up the big ball into smaller balls, and reform the big ball later on. Basically, the idea is to get the ball as large as possible and to make it to the end of the stage. You can get attacked by black spiky things that will reduce your size. At the end of the stage, you see how well you did getting larger, and collecting other random stuff. And that’s how the whole game goes. There’s not much else. If you’ve played one stage, you’ve sorta played them all. I got through the first world. One plus is that the game is super cute. Like the little yellow balls will sing in random pseudo-Japanese (it’s not actual Japanese, but it uses Japanese syllables). And the theme song is sorta addicting. Just listen to it!

I was only gonna order one, but then they said I had to use all of my credit at once, so I ordered 3. Stupid Threadless! Anyway, here’s what I ordered: Pencil Forest When I saw Pencil Forest debut a few weeks ago (or was it last week?) I thought it was pretty cool. But not $15 cool. Luckily, it’s $10 cool. It sorta doesn’t make sense though. So the guy is cutting down the tress to make pencils? But why are the trees made of pencil shavings? Oh well, I guess it doesn’t really need to make sense. Para Poppins I’ve wanted Para Poppins for a while now, though I don’t think it’s ever been in stock during a $10, which is usually when I’ll buy shirts from threadless. It’s just the kind of weird, off-beat shirt that I find myself gravitated towards. I’m sure Mary Poppins will show those insurgents who’s boss! Stone Jungle Stone Jungle is a pretty cool looking shirt that has some city stuff on the top, and nature stuff on the bottom! How artsy fartsy! I got it because I was forced to get 3 shirts. I like the design, plus green is my favorite color, so yeah, there ya go. In fact, I just noticed that all the shirts I ordered today have a shade of green in them… Weird. The Threadless Spring Broke sale lasts until March 12, so get the shirts you want now! And vote for this shirt to be reprinted!!!"

And by that, I mean gossip shows that only talk about Anna Nicole Smith. For some reason, I thought that Louie Anderson was still hosting Family Feud. He’s kind of depressing and scary, so that’s why I have a bad image of Family Feud. Well, they finally kicked out Louie Anderson (probably a long time ago) and now John O’ Hurley is hosting! Who is John O’ Hurley, you ask? I dunno, but he played J. Peterman on Seinfeld! It’s kind of weird seeing a character actor like him hosting Family Feud. Like there was a contestant named “Elaine” and when he said “come up, Elaine” I had weird Seinfeld flashbacks! He even said it in J. Peterman’s voice! I guess technically it’s his actual voice, but still. Oh, and speaking of Family Feud, I really hate how they show the answers at the end of each round. Like they have the audience read them to us slowly as if we’re blabbering, illiterate idiots. I suppose most people who watch Family Feud are, though. (Not me, of course) Also, where do they find these families? Can people be so out of touch with reality that they think funerals are a good time to have a family portrait taken? Or that Wal-Marts exist in malls!? Who are these people!?"

They’re also going to pay for me to fly over there and visit the school on March 24-26. I have the Google College Day thing on the 23rd though. Maybe I can just fly over there directly from California. I’m gonna be tired when I get back! As for the whole grad school thing, if the Google thing works out, I may decide to not go to grad school. I’m definitely keeping my options open, though. The scholarship offer from Michigan makes it feasible (at least, I think) for me to go to school there. If I get some kind of assistantship or maybe a paid internship (Google has an office in Ann Arbor), I could make it work. All in all, I’m very happy to have options, as they help to keep my stress levels down (if one thing doesn’t work I could go to the next, etc). I’ll post updates as soon as I get them."

        "content": "I hate having spare change. Change sucks because it usually just sits in your house and it’s a waste of money. I found a way to use the change you have and never get change back when purchasing with cash. With a set of just 10 coins, you can make change for any amount from 1 cent to 99. I’ve already read about the 10 coins somewhere else online. It’s not really interesting to have the answer given to you. Since I’m a nerdy computer scientist, I was trying to come up with an algorithm to produce this set of coins. I came up with an iterative solution that goes like this: Start out with no coins. From 1 to 99 cents: If you can make exact change for the current amount, go to the next amount. Otherwise, try adding the largest denomination coin to your set of coins (a quarter) that will allow you to pay the exact amount. If it’s too big, go to the next smallest until you hit a penny. End Loop. I came up with this in the shower. When I got out and tried it, it actually worked! Here’s a portion of the trace through the loop: No coins, I need to make change for 1 cent. Add a penny. Yay, I can make change for one cent! … 4 pennies, need to make change for 5 cents. Add a nickel. … 4 pennies 1 nickel, need to make change for 10 cents. Add a dime. And so on. I believe the algorithm works because it uses a greedy heuristic of choosing the largest denomination coin first before defaulting to the penny. Am I a nerd? Yes. Oh, I just realized I didn’t actually say which 10 coins were the ones you need. They’re 4 pennies, one nickel, two dimes, and three quarters. You can also do it with two nickels and one dime but that’s not what my algorithm came up with, plus two dimes are lighter than two nickels! Have fun getting rid of your change!"

I already had a microphone from Socom, so I figured I wouldn’t need an extra mic. Luckily it worked. So the basic premise of Karaoke Revolution is that you sing songs, and you get more points if you sing in tune with the correct vocals. There are note “tubes” that show up indicating whether you’re singing too low or high. It’s not quite like reading music or anything, but I guess it’s pretty good for public use. I really like the idea of playing a game with only your voice. It’s a pretty interesting idea and I’m kind of mad that I waited so long to finally buy a Karaoke Revolution game. I sort of secretly wanted to buy it ever since seeing these guys playing it. The gameplay isn’t perfect, though. It seems like the game has an easier time recognizing pitch in higher octaves, so if you’re a guy, you already have a disadvantage to the girls. Also, the game is really strict in telling you exactly how to sing a song. So when I add some “soul” it ends up costing me points. Boo! It’d be pretty sweet if the game could detect freestyling and reward players for doing it well. I guess that would be pretty hard though. The song selection is varied. There’s a lot of songs from the 80s up to current popular songs. They even have Neil Diamond, which my brother was happy about. I think most people will find at least one song they’d be interesting in singing, if they’re interested in singing a song to begin with. Overall, Karaoke Revolution Party is a pretty cool party game. I wish I had bought two mics so I could test out the versus and duet modes. I think there’s some duets… Maybe I’ll buy the new American Idol version ."

Google College Days are fun! We’ll fly you out before the interviews, provide lodging and transport you to Google on Friday morning for a full day visit and then fly you back home. You’ll be on site from 8:45 AM - 3:15 PM on Friday. Below is the agenda for our College Days. 8:45 AM Depart to Google (we’ll pick you up from your hotel) 9:15 AM Arrive Google and Check-In 9:30 AM Kick Off (executive sponsor to speak and kick off the day, coffee and pastries) 10:15 AM Interviews (3, 45 minute technical interviews). Please note: You will be asked questions to test your coding, algorithm and design skills. You might want to refer to labs.google.com to learn more about our products in beta. 12:05 PM Tour of the Googleplex 12:50 Lunch at the Google Cafe with engineers 1:45 PM Organized Free Time (have a chair massage, chat with other students) 2:15 PM Q&amp;A/Closing (Engineers and Recruiters show up to answer questions about life at Google and the hiring process, etc.) 2:45 PM Ice Cream Social (Build a sundae and chat with other students, Google Engineers and Recruiters) 3:15 PM Depart to hotel (we’ll transport you back to your hotel) This is way too cool. I think it’s the dream of every nerd to visit the Googleplex , and to be flown out there (for free) for a tour, food, and interviews is just plain awesome. The fact that they’re interviewing me for a position is like icing on the cake for a nerd like myself. I wonder if I’ll be allowed to take pictures… It’d make an awesome blog post. I’ll be attending their March 23rd one, since it’s the date with the least conflict for me. Hopefully everything will go well and I’ll be able to visit the Googleplex on a more regular basis.

When the guy got to our house, we didn’t answer the door. He opened our outer shutter door and left a pig in between the two doors. I could see all of this happening through our peep hole, even though It’d be pretty impossible to see that low in real life. Weird. Okay, now that I think of it, I guess he was more of a pig mailman than a salesman, but I have a feeling we were billed for the pig. To be payed for at a later date. Anyway, when I opened the door, the pig ran in and I guess we kept it as a pet. I went to my neighbor’s house and found that the pig guy had left a pig in her door as well. When I opened it though, it was like some kind of mutant weird pig and I ran away. Later, I went to my across the street neighbor’s house. We had seen him with his pig earlier, so I guess we decided to check up on it. When we got there, he adamantly denied having any kind of pig. We knew he was lying because we saw him playing with the pig though his window from our house. Then the dream ended. It totally made no sense to me, but that’s how a lot of my dreams go. It’s probably worth noting that today is Chinese New Year, and yes, it’s the year of the pig!!! Maybe that somehow subconsciously seeped into my brain while I was dreaming last night… Also, my Chinese zodiac sign is the pig!!! Dun dun dunnnn!!!"

        "content": "So I finished my first phone interview with Google. Overall I thought it was very fair and I didn’t get the types of mind-bending puzzles that people claim they are asked. I won’t disclose the questions I was asked, not because they asked me to, but because I think it would undermine the effectiveness of the interview process itself. Plus I have a feeling that Google “Googles” to find questions posted online and doesn’t use them anyway. I had a chance to describe a project that I had worked on. I chose Notecentric , since it was more complex than Anime Nano and I could say that I worked on the entire thing by myself. I did a pretty simple (and nervous) high level overview of the system and my reasons for creating it. The first question I got was a simple data structure implementation efficiency question. I’m pretty glad I studied my data structures beforehand. It took me a while (and a few hints) before I came to the correct solution. It was sort of a “well duh!!” moment, but I’m glad that I at least reached it. Though it took a while, I thought I did well in rationalizing my ideas and explaining why they wouldn’t work quite right. Plus coming up with a solution to a problem is very stressful with a real life Google Engineer listening to you think it through! I think the interviews are mostly to see how you think, not how quickly you can derive the right answer. The second question was a pretty open ended one about role playing as a Google Engineer. I guess that’s as vague as I can get without actually saying what the question was. I think the question was more about seeing how much I knew about Google and how I would behave in the company itself. I think I did fairly well in this question, going through a lot of edge cases and coming up with ideas that might those handle edge cases, etc. I also had a chance to ask a question about Google. I asked about the 20% projects, as it’s something I find really unique about the company. I also gave the interviewer a feature request for Gmail, though she wasn’t directly working on that project. Overall, I think the interview had its desired effect. Google learned more about my thought process and critical thinking skills. I probably won’t hear from the recruiter again until Monday at the soonest, since it’s the weekend now. Hopefully they’ll have another phone interview or even an onsite interview lined up for me shortly."

I’ve been looking at the giant algorithms book , just refreshing myself on stuff like O notation, common sorting algorithms like mergesort, and stuff like that. I should probably move on to more complicated algorthms next like Dijkstra’s Algorithm and dynamic programming algorithms like the all pairs shortest path algorithm . I don’t think Google would ask me about specific implmentations of these, but it would be good practice to get back into the mindset of designing algorithms this complex, since I haven’t had to do so in a while. I saw a sample interview question from some blog asking about defining a function f(a,b) to return a string that is all of the characters in a (in order) that are also in b. They ask for an order n 2 as well as an order n algorithm. The n 2 one seems trivial, but I can’t think of how to calculate a set intersection (which is what I think the problem boils down to) in order n time… I could try and prove that it would be impossible to do it in n time, but I don’t really want to do that either. Plus I’m not sure if it is impossible… Edit: Okay, so apparently they’re “strings” for a reason. The N solution is pretty easy. I was trying to solve a more complex problem in N, when I just needed to take a look at the actual question being asked. I guess I should do regular sanity checks during the interview and not try to accomplish more than they ask. Well, back to the book for me."

        "content": "I just read about a really awesome use for Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk: finding missing people! From the Mechanical Turk’s page: On Sunday, January 28th, 2007, Jim Gray , a renowned computer scientist was reported missing at sea. As of Thursday, Feb. 1st, the US Coast Guard has called off the search, having found no trace of the boat or any of its emergency equipment. Follow the story here. Through the generous efforts of his friends, family, various communities and agencies, detailed satellite imagery has been made available for his last known whereabouts. You will be presented with 5 images. The task is to indicate any satellite images which contain any foreign objects in the water that may resemble Jim’s sailboat or parts of a boat. Jim’s sailboat will show up as a regular object with sharp edges, white or nearly white, about 10 pixels long and 4 pixels wide in the image. If in doubt, be conservative and mark the image. Marked images will be sent to a team of specialists who will determine if they contain information on the whereabouts of Jim Gray. While I think it’s a really nifty and commendable idea, it bothers me how vulnerable this system is from the way I understand it. It seems to me that once an image is marked as containing a sailboat-like object, it will be sent to others for investigation. If not, it will be discarded. In computer science, you’re trained to think as an adversary to the algorithm. While I’d hope there aren’t any people malicious enough to try and sabotage this system, it’s always worth considering the possibility. I’ve thought of a few vulnerabilities that the Mechanical Turk faces in the search for Jim Gray: Vulnerability 1 The adversary marks each picture as not containing anything of interest, even if it does. In the case that an adversary finds the picture with the sailboat, he and he alone can invalidate it. The data is never considered and the search fails. I’m assuming a few things about the system. The biggest assumption is that each HIT will be viewed by only one person. The Mechanical Turk doesn’t specify this. If two people are assigned to each hit, the odds of this happening are lower. Though this system can still be defeated by two adversaries working in tandem. Vulnerability 2 The adversary marks each picture as being interesting. An overwhelming amount of data is sent to the “team of specialists” and we’re back to square one. We can’t just assume that all of the pictures flagged as interesting were not, because one could be useful. This kind of attack seems much more malicious to me. At best, you could invalidate all of the adversary’s HITs and reassign them. This could take precious time, though, since once a HIT is taken, it is locked from other users to attempt. Vulnerability 3 The adversary randomly marks non-interesting pictures interesting, and interesting pictures to be non-interesting. This is probably the most malicious and the hardest to detect. While the odds of finding an interesting picture to mark non-interesting would be low, it could happen. I can’t think of a way to combat this kind of attack, apart from having two users work on each HIT. Again, this could still be defeatable by two adversaries working together to dirty the results. Conclusion Even with these vulnerabilities, I think the Mechanical Turk’s search for Jim Gray is an incredible idea. I sincerely hope that they do find him. It would be a great victory for everyone involved. Please do join in the search for Jim Gray. Please don’t follow any of the adversarial techniques I mentioned! I just hope that the people behind the Mechanical Turk are aware of these vulnerabilities, and have come up with solutions (that are better than mine) to combat any kind of malicious use that could undermine the entire project. If you have any ideas to combat these vulnerabilities, or have any other ideas for vulnerabilities that I may have missed, please let me know in the comments. I’d be interested from a computer science sort of viewpoint."

We both went to the Google Information Session a while back, where I got a sweet, sweet Google shirt. Anyway, he was awesome enough to offer to forward my resume internally. After a few weeks and some other paperwork, I’ve been offered a phone interview! I’m not too sure how many people get to this point, but I’m pretty stoked about it. I’ve read that the interviews are pretty hard, though they really should be. I mean, it’s Google, after all! I should be getting a date for the phone interview very soon. Until then, I think I’ll try and brush up on my algorithms , asymptotic analysis , probability , and combinatorics ! Don’t fail me now, Introduction to Algorithms ! I’m feeling lucky!"

I went to Play-Asia.com and ordered the cheapest component cables . I ordered ‘em on the 23rd and they came on the 31st, so it took about a week. So far, I’m fairly impressed. After switching the Wii from 480i to 480p, the difference is pretty noticeable. Before, I could see the picture getting blurry where the cursor was moving. It was kinda weird. With the component cables, that doesn’t happen anymore. I tried playing Zelda: Twilight Princess. There’s a huge difference with the cables. Before it was super blurry, and now it’s somewhat jaggy. Sure, the antialiasing could use work, but it still looks 100% better. If you have a Wii and a TV that takes component input, you MUST get cables. These ones were like $13, shipping included."

RMagick does graphics stuff, like resizing and creating captcha images and whatnot, so I really need it. I ran into a few gotchas while trying to install RMagic (well, installing ImageMagick) so here’s what I did: First, you must install ImageMagick. This involves installing a bunch of dependencies first. I did all of the ones listed on the Rmagick ImageMagick installation guide , but the ./configure command still wouldn’t see the jpeg delegate library. The error message I got when trying to install RMagick was like this: “No decode delegate for this image format.” I found out from this page that I needed to run: “./configure –enable-shared” for it to register properly. When I tried running make and make install, I got some error like this: Magick::ImageMagickError: unable to read font `…/ghostscript/fonts/n019003l.pfbâ€™ It turns out the font directory set up for ImageMagick didn’t have any fonts… So I downloaded the GhostScript fonts (I had already installed GhostScript) into that directory.

        "content": "So I’ve been fiddling around with trying to get my rails applications installed on Media Temple’s (dv) 3 server. It’s a pretty nice setup; basically a dedicated server (though virtual) that you can play around with to your heart’s content. While they “support” Plesk 8.1 which in turn supports ruby on rails, they do not offer support for ruby on rails installation. Since I’m a pretty hardcore CS guy, I don’t mind learning stuff. It is easier when there’s support people to help you though. At first I had tried using rails with fastcgi, but that’s apparently a bad idea. The dv supports fcgid anyway. Media Temple’s support told me it was already installed, but guess what? It wasn’t. I had to go into plesk and get the updater to install it. I’ve been trying to get my apps to run for more than a week now. I’ve been working on it in my free time, and I finally got one of them to actually start doing something. There were a bunch of hurdles I had to jump over just to get it to work. Here’s the last thing I needed to do: I was getting some “Application error: Rails application failed to start properly” errors. The rails log wasn’t too helpful. The httpd one wasn’t either. I looked in the /var/log/httpd/suexec_log file and it said stuff like: [2007-01-30 15:36:58]: file is writable by others: (/var/www/…/public/dispatch.fcgi) I thought, “well okay, it's just a warning.” Who cares if it's group writable? After doing some other random stuff, and changing the permissions accidentally, I got this: [2007-01-30 15:32:30]: file has no execute permission: (/var/www/…/public/dispatch.fcgi) Okay, so now it’s complaining that it has no execute permission. Whoops. I chmodded it to something like 775 and I get the “file is writable by others” thing again, along with the application error. So I thought, “what the heck” and chmodded the file to a safer 755. It seems that did the job, so now I can execute the app! I never knew that apache (or suexec or fcgid or whatever the heck is running dispatch.fcgi) really cared so much about permissions. I’ll have to be more thoughtful of logfiles from now on…"

Unfortunately, I just lost my first game. I think the game gets harder as your skill level progresses. The first game, I got like, 11 runs or something. And there’s only 3 innings! I’d say that Wii Baseball is probably the most physically challenging, since you’re either flinging the remote as fast as possible when pitching, or doing an actual bat swing when batting. Eventually I got tired of doing the whole “hey batter batter” thing and just used one hand. I still use two when I’m not sore, though. During my first loss, I found out that there’s a mercy rule. Yep, when you have 0 runs and the opponent has 5, it’s time to just give up. This is pretty much crap, since on my first game, I won by like, 10 runs or so. I totally would’ve made a sick comeback, too. Stupid Wii baseball…"

        "content": "Back in High School, my friend Jennae wrote a song entitled “Hung Truong Is The Sexiest Man Alive.” While cleaning up my room, I found the original manuscript, so I decided to put it up on my blog for your reading pleasure. I think it started out as a one verse joke that got a little carried away. The song is pretty long, a veritable five page opus, so here are the main points: I, Hung Truong, am the sexiest man alive Women want me, and men want to be like me The singer wishes she was my girlfriend, but she can’t be because I’m too good for her because I am the sexiest man alive It is a fact that I am alive, and not dead I can beat up superheroes and look better in their clothing I am courageous and I recite poetry eloquently A large statue of myself erected in the city center would be desirable to the singer Maybe I can get Jennae to record it and release the thing as an MP3! If you want the long version, look no further. Since I’m narcissistic and bored, I’ve typed out the whole thing: Hung Truong Is The Sexiest Man Alive Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive, I wish I was his girlfriend, but I can’t be, Because he’s too good for me. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive, Women want him and men want to be like him. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive. Yes he is alive that’s so cool because he’s so sexy, he’s living and breathing, that means he’s alive, and he won’t die for a long long time, I hope. The world would be so much darker if Hung died but it’s happy because he’s alive. For now Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive I wish I was his girlfriend but I can’t be Because he’s too good for me. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive Women want him and men want to be like him. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive Yes he is so sexy all the girls scream when he walks in the room Everybody loves him, he’s so popular His muscles are huge and his face is cute. Yeah he’s so hot. Every magazine wants him on its cover But he doesn’t advertize. Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive I wish I was his girlfriend, but I can’t be, Because he’s too good for me. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive, Women want him and men want to be like him. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive. Hung is so wonderful There’s nothing he can’t do He’s so skilled in many areas of life. He’s so talented and so cool Everyone thinks he’s sexy. He’s so amazing in every way He is a woman’s ideal man. Every man wants to attain his perfection Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive I wish I was his girlfriend, but I can’t be, Because he’s too good for me. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive, Women want him and men want to be like him. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive. Yes it’s true that Hung kicks Superman’s butt He also is stealthier than Bat Man and he looks better in the bat suit too He is so amazing and handsome and brave, He saves damsels in distress and he slays dragons, He can beat anyone up no matter how big they are His speech is eleoquent and he recites amazing poetry He can do anything in the world He’s big and tough and buff. Too bad he’s dead. Just kidding Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive I wish I was his girlfriend, but I can’t be, Because he’s too good for me. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive, Women want him and men want to be like him. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive. Some day We should build a statue of Hung And put it in the middle of the city for all to see It would make everyone really happy to see a huge statue of Hung Everyday. People would come from all around to look at Hung’s statue. Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive I wish I was his girlfriend, but I can’t be, Because he’s too good for me. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive, Women want him and men want to be like him. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive. There’s not much more to say about Hung We all know he’s great and super and cool and sexy, Hung Truong is sexy, and he’s alive, and good looking and talented and wonderful and amazing Now that everyone knows all about Hung I’ll just sing the chorus A few more times Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive I wish I was his girlfriend, but I can’t be, Because he’s too good for me. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive, Women want him and men want to be like him. ‘Cause Hung Truong is the sexiest man alive.

        "content": "That’s right! Two months after the Wii was released in America, I finally got it! Yesterday was some kind of national Wii holiday. Apparently 1/21/06 was the day for all retailers to hold the Wii. This is probably why I couldn’t find one in stock for the past two weeks since my last attempt. I decided to head over to Circuit City around 9am. That’s an hour before they open. I was surprised to see two guys standing there. They told me that the Circuit City guys only had 2 Wiis to sell to the general public, and that the others would go to their pre-order customers. False Advertsising!!! I’m probably going to file a compaint. Next I got to Best Buy around 9:30. I was under the impression that the store would open at 11am, since that’s what the online store checker thing said. The opening time was actually 10am. So I got there only 30 minutes early. I saw a pretty long line and counted around 38 people in front of me. Still, I figured they might have a ton; they’re Best Buy. So once 10am rolls along, they start herding us in there like cattle. One person remarked that it was a good sign that they didn’t hand out tickets. There must be enough for everyone in line. We snaked around the store until we got to the video game section. There we waited for each person to pick up a Wii and move along. It was kind of like the Soup Nazi thing from Seinfeld. When I finally get to the Wiis, there are about 3 left after mine. My linemates and I all share some high tens. In my daze of my accomplishment, I decided to also pick up Legend of Zelda: Twighlight Princess at full price. This is even though I know I can get it cheaper. I’m a tool like that. I didn’t even use a gamer’s gift card… As far as the Wii goes, it’s pretty darn cool. The remote control is neat because it can give you some vibration feedback when you’re going over buttons. The IR sensor is still kind of inaccurate, but maybe I need to do some more calibration. Wii Sports is insanely fun. I could probably play the bowling game for hours at a time. That is, if my arm wasn’t so sore right now. My mom even played it, and did really well in bowling. My dad couldn’t quite get the hang of releasing the button before throwing the ball. Zelda is pretty cool, but the graphics seem kind of lacking. I’m gonna go get a component cable and see if that doesn’t help things. I think the Wii graphics are only slightly better than the Gamecube, which was actually the strongest console of the last generation… Another cool thing is that the Wii has full backwards compatibility for the Gamecube. You just flip open the top and find some memory card slots and controller ports. I really wish there was an option to save to internal memory, though. It kind of blows that I need to keep using the very small Gamecube memory card. All in all, I think the Wii is very cool. Hopefully the good games will keep rolling in. I might have to pick up Trauma Center or Wario Ware . Wii Play is coming out soon, too."

That’s right, you got a video game for subscribing to Nintendo Power! The deal was too sweet to pass up, so I finally convinced my mom to get me the magazine. I ended up getting addicted to RPGs because of Dragon Warrior, too. I pretty much learned how to read on Nintendo Power. It was so awesome. Nintendo Power would usually have entire maps of games laid out on two pages. I’d sit there and plan out how the game would actually play, even though I never ended up playing the actual games. I also recall there being some pretty cool comic strips like the Metroid one and Zelda one. There was also a comic about the origins of Wario, which was really weird in retrospect. I remember always trying to win prizes in the survey contests in each issue. They would be ridiculous prizes, like “win every single SNES game ever!” Too bad I never won… I guess my love affair with Nintendo Power ended with the whole Playstation generation thing. Like the Playstation got FFVII, and the Nintendo 64 graphics were horrible. I didn’t even get a Nintendo 64 (though my cousin did, and we had a blast with Goldeneye). Plus I realized that Nintendo Power was probably the most biased publication ever. I don’t think I ever saw a score below 7.0. And there were definitely Nintendo games that were seriously bad. I did end up getting a Gamecube, and I really want to get a Wii. Maybe it’s time I resubscribed to Nintendo Power… Then again, do I really want to pay $5 for a subscription to Nintendo ads?"

But The band played on anyway and Tom Siegel, trumpet player, sent me a link to some videos of the event. I didn’t wanna kill their bandwidth, so I’m putting up the clips on my own site. Giant Steps was a local (Albuquerque) ska band that was pretty popular during the “third wave” of ska. I’d pin that era somewhere around 1996 to uh, 2000 or so. At least, that’s when the third wave was most popular. As far as I know, Reel Big Fish is still doing their thing. Anyway, Giant Steps was fairly well known to me, because two of my high school teachers were in it! My high school band teacher, Paul Blakey, played baritone sax, and Mr. Siegel, I mean… Tom played trumpet. How cool is that? I actually didn’t end up going to many of their gigs, but I did hear them live a few times. One thing that Tom told me is that you can now buy Giant Step’s CDs on iTunes ! How cool is that? I’d still rather have the hard copy though, for nostalgia purposes and whatnot. Ooh. Also, I remember hearing that “Feel the Thunder” was written about Paul Blakey’s snoring. I’m not if this is true, but why would anyone lie about that? On to the videos: Boom Ska: Came: Mr. Smooth: Double Time Skank: Miles: Sharp Funky Mama: Puto Deus Fio: Soul Rebel: Boneman: Feel The Thunder: One Day Soon: Back Out: Brown Eyed Girl: If you like these Giant Steps videos, please support them (even though they’ve retired) by buying their cds. Maybe if you buy enough, the fourth wave of ska will come!"

        "content": "The focus of today’s Macworld 2007 was definitely the iPhone. While general consensus is that the iPhone is the next killer app, I still have my doubts. Here are 4 reasons why the Apple iPhone will fail: 1. Public Acceptance: The average person doesn’t even use the WAP browser on their phone, let alone any full blown OSX apps! What people want in a mobile phone is a phone; they don’t need all of these extras. Extra software just makes it more difficult to perform the main function of the phone: to make phone calls. 2. Price: The price of the iPhone was announced at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB with a 2 year contract. Right now, you can get a T-Mobile MDA smartphone for $0 after rebate. The mass market is not willing to pay this much for a phone. 3. Copyright and Regulations: There already is an iPhone out. It’s the Linksys Wireless-G Skype iPhone . I hope Apple has a lot of money or lawyers to acquire the rights to the name. Pair this with the fact that the iPhone doesn’t have FCC approval and we might never see the iPhone get to market. How did Steve make all of those phone calls anyway? 4. Battery Life: The iPhone runs OSX! This is great for a laptop or a desktop computer, but does a phone really need OSX? The battery life was announced as 5 hours of talk time, browsing, or video. Basically, 5 hours of active use. What happens after that? Your phone is dead and no one can call you. People are not going to use the iPhone’s features for fear of losing their connectivity when the battery runs out."

        "content": "Back in the Spring of 2005, I took an intro to video game design and programming class. While I had a pretty good background in programming, I hadn’t done the kind of stuff for video games before. The first assignment in the class was to come up with some kind of game concept that would end up being a project for the class. I really love RPGs, and the more offbeat they are, the better. One of my favorites is Earthbound for the SNES. I also dig the SRPGs from Nippon Ichi like Disgaea. Originally I wanted to do a Strategy RPG in the setting of campus life. It was called “UNM Tactics!” The whole SRPG thing didn’t turn out so well, and in the end, we made a generic style university RPG instead. We kept the name as UNM Tactics, even though it wasn’t really a tactics type game. We used RPG Maker XP, which is a really easy to use frontend system for, well, making RPGs. After pulling a few all nighters, we finished the final presentation, and as a pleasant surprise, I got an A+! After the class, I sorta forgot about the game, but I was reminded of it after watching that movie, College Saga. From the readme: UNM Tactics is an RPG set at the University of New Mexico. It was created by a team of programmers and artists for CS 491: Intro to Video Game Development. While a working demo was created, the game was never fully completed. This game is the demo that was used for the final class presentation. You can download the game here if you don’t want the story to be spoiled. The game comes in a self extracting executable. You just need to run it and point it to an output directory. Then run the “Game.exe” file and you’re good to go! The game should run on any Windows system, though I’ve only tested it on Windows XP. Use the contact form if you need some support. Now it’s time for screencaps and commentary! This is the SUB, or Student Union Building. I made all of the tiles by hand. Well, in Photoshop… This screen is right before you fight the Emo. You need to fight the Emo to get a Chicken Burger for the ITEL system so you can pass the semester. Yeah, school is complicated… This is the overhead map. We just copied and pasted from Google Maps for the UNM area. Everything’s where it’s supposed to be, though! You need to press space on the bullseyes to get enter that area. To the North is the duck pond . To the South is South Lot (duh) and the bookstore. This is the battle screen. The Nerd is using his special power, Segmentation Fault . This attack has the elemental power of “math,” which thugs are weak against. You’ll also notice that the Emo has joined the party. His special move is “cut self.” This screen is from one of the missions. You need to fight the King Duck who has taken over the duck pond. He’s based on a real life goose who runs amok at the UNM Duck Pond. If you ever see him, watch out! Originally I wanted to make South Lot like the lost woods in The Legend of Zelda. This proved to be too much work, so I just made it a couple of screens. Yes, there are only like, 3 kinds of cars at the lot. And yes, those are DDR arrows pointing you to the next screen… Here’s the battle with the malfunctioning South Lot Bus. If you look closely, you can tell that it is in fact the G and Q Lot bus. Also, the background of the battle is the Q Lot. You’ll also notice that there’s a bus driver in there. He’s actually a pretty cool guy. The radio stations that Wesley picks are always the best. After you complete all of the missions in the demo, you get to fight the final boss. I won’t spoil it; you’ll have to beat the game yourself. Also, check it out, the Emo is back at Chick-fil-A, even though he’s in our party! So much for bug testing… While I did a whole lot of this game, I didn’t do all of it. Here’s some credits! Original Concept, Story, Programming, Scenario Maps: Hung Truong Character Design and Art: Robert Foley and Marcus Smith The World Map: Anthony Hayes The Alien and Emo Models: James R Holten IV Game Music: Alex Santoya and Weezer Funny story: All of the characters are supposed to correspond to one person who was in the game. The nerd is supposed to look like me, Anthony is the playboy, Robert is the jock. The emo character is some guy in our group who really did go emo and dropped the class. Go figure. Overall, UNM Tactics was a lot of hard work, but I’m fairly proud of the finished product. Feel free to download it, play it, and share it. Just don’t charge money or pay for it. Like anyone would pay for this…"

Like the random NPCs just wandering back and forth, and the girl who says the same thing when you talk to her twice. Or the ludicrousness of some small object blocking your path, or how it seems normal to go into someone’s house (dorm room) and steal all of their stuff… The movie makes heavy use of video game music and sound effects. It’s really sad because I could recognize where almost all of the music came from. You can watch College Saga in 10 minute bite size chunks, or just watch the whole thing right here: This totally reminds me of my UNM RPG that I made for that video game class I took.

So I guess in that respect, Wirefly wins. I’m actually thinking about getting a new phone, so I just “pretended” to buy a new phone at both stores. The Motorola Razr V3t immediately comes to mind as something I’d like to buy. At Wirefly, the phone is $49.99 with a $50 rebate. At Amazon.com, the phone is $24.99 with a $50 rebate and a $25 rebate. The prices after rebate are $.01 and -$50.01 for Wirefly and Amazon.com, respectively. These are both the price paid when bought with a plan. I think Amazon.com is pretty much the standard when it comes to buying phone service online. They have a pretty good reputation and very good prices. I can’t say anything about Wirefly’s service, but it seems okay from the website. I guess the only thing I could say is that if you’re looking for Alltel service, you won’t find it at Amazon.com. Wirefly looks like a decent retailer; it just isn’t as good as Amazon. I’d still go with Amazon in the end due to the prices and trust I have in that online retailer."

I decided to quickly post it on cheapassgamer before the fatwallet horde took them all. They’re still available. Apparently, the PS3 is not really in any kind of demand anymore at all. Here’s a few select responses to the post I made last night: I saw 10 60GB ones in my BB store. Some people looked at the box for awhile and then wondered off. I think the $599 price scares most people away. They had numerous PS3 at BB near Regency here in Jacksonville, FL. They are just sitting there. I have passed on PS3’s at two different stores in the last week. All three stores (Bestbuy and TRU) had more than 5 or 6 just sitting there. I asked workers in the game area and they both said they had been there a few days. Just not worth it to most people. I’ve walked in to BB, Wal-Mart and Target and every store has had PS3s just sitting there and no Wiis to be seen. Here are the places I saw them this weekend in Houston Frys 2 best buys 1 EB games 1 Gamestop 2 Targets 1 Walmart Ouch. Sorry Sony, I think you’ve lost this round. Update: I headed over to Target to try and snag a Wii today. They didn’t have any but then I went to Best Buy to see if they had the Wii. Apparently I missed the last one by a minute. I did, however, spot two 60GB PS3s just sitting there, not being sold."

The question now is whether I should keep it to play, or resell it on ebay. The ebay prices have been falling steadily, and I have a feeling it might be a risk to put it on ebay. On the other hand, I don’t really want the 20gb PS3 right now. I’d be pretty happy with a Wii, though. If I think I can make a profit, I’ll probably just put the thing on ebay.

Phoenix Wright is a lawyer game. Yeah, that’s right, you play as a defense lawyer. Your job is to prove that your client is innocent, even when the evidence is strongly against him. While this might not sound like the coolest idea for a game, it actually works pretty well. You listen to witnesses give their testimony and try to find inconsistencies. If they lie, you press them until they admit to it, or present evidence that proves that they’re lying. It’s pretty fun. Right now I’m on the third case, where I need to prove that an action star is innocent of murder. The characters are all fairly amusing, and the story isn’t bad either. Apparently, the Phoenix Wright 2 preorder is underway. You can get a finger stylus to point at liars if you preorder."

Apparently the book lasts hundreds of CDs, so the table of contents is really long. He’s joined by Johnathan Coulton, who sings the theme song for the audio book. Apparently, pairs of Johns are usually very entertaining. Since this is an “annotated edition,” I’d actually think about buying the book (and reading it)! The book’s only like, $11 on amazon.com , so it wouldn’t be too difficult of a decision."

        "content": "Back when I was a media arts major (in 2002), I made a movie called “Hellevator.” It’s probably the crowning achievement of my career at UNM. I figured I should put it online for posterity, and include comments before I forget about what happened. [flv:/blog/video/Hellevator.flv 480 360] I skipped putting it on youtube, since the compression sucks. Here’s some of my director’s commentary: The movie was actually based on a two-minute play that I and Brian Hesch wrote during drama class in high school. The idea was that the two characters would enter the elevator and then just “fall” for the entire thing. Needless to say, the script was reworked to make it more interesting. SuperTonic Productions was my made up production company name. The Supertonic is the second note in a diatonic scale. I learned about it in theory during music class. I thought it was a really cool name because it rhymes with Supersonic or something! The movie was filmed in one night at UNM’s Center For the Arts. The first half of the movie looks really bad, because I captured it from VHS tape. The second half looks good, because I had split the movie into two halves to fit on a CD. I only ended up getting the second half though… Paul McLaughlin is the first person to appear in the movie. He was just some random guy from class. I make a cameo in the movie. I’m the guy who exits the elevator facing the wrong way. I thought it would be weird that way. Will Belletto plays the role of “Khan, just Khan.” He’s the captain of the ultimate frisbee team at UNM right now. I named the guy “Khan” because it’s a cool name. Like the guy from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan . Cory Ponder plays the role of “Samantha Powers.” This is a play on names: “Samuel Powers” is the real name of Saved By the Bell’s “Screech.” Alex Hoffman played the role of “Dr. Pepper.” He claimed to be a projectionist. He also claimed to have a girlfriend who was a stripper in Las Vegas. He disappeared after shooting, which probably means he went to Las Vegas to be with his girlfriend. Or not. Anyway, that’s the reason we have the dedication at the end of the movie. He didn’t really die. I don’t think. When Dr. Pepper says “bleepin’ mohawk,” it’s an in-joke from high school drama class. There was this guy with a mohawk, and we’d blame him for stuff. Like if it was raining that day. “Fucking mohawk!” The bleep sound effect is actually Adobe Premiere’s countdown timer bleep. The music inside the elevator is “ Girl From Ipanema ,” which is usually used in media as the cliche “elevator music” song. The Six Flags ride that the characters mention that bears a striking resemblance to their situation is Freefall . The music used in the “Twenty Minutes Later…” title card is Herb Alpert’s “Spanish Flea.” This song was also used in that TV show, “The Dating Game.” The original script called for Khan asking Samantha Powers for Tic Tacs, since he didn’t want to meet his maker with bad breath. I forgot to bring the Tic Tacs, though. Thus, the strangely inappropriately long shot of Khan using Chapstick. The shot of Khan pushing the button to open the elevator doors near the end of the movie was slowed down for dramatic impact. Khan puts on his sunglasses before opening the elevator doors (since hell is probably pretty bright and firey), but in the next shot, his glasses are off again. Oops. Khan and Samantha start saying “uh… sure” before Dr. Pepper even asks if he can get in! They must be psychic. The music during the credits is once again “The Girl From Ipanema.” This time, it’s an arrangement by Bobby Shew from his album, “ Heavyweights .” Fun fact: I got my “shoe” autographed one time at a concert by Bobby Shew. Get it!? He really signed the bottom of it, but then it wore out because I walked on it too much… People tell me the credits took too long to roll. Nicole Buckles was in our class. She helped provide sound effects, like the one of the screeching elevator. I think…"

The device is specifically designed to look like a dog humping a laptop. Moreover, it is mechanical. Yes, the dog physically humps the laptop when you “plug it in.” The website (in Japanese) states, “Once you insert it, it doesn’t stop!” I’m not even sure that the USB device has any memory, as the website says nothing about capacity. I think it’s just more of a desk toy than anything. It costs 998 yen, which is less than $10.

It sorta goes from minor to a major section, back to minor, so you can do a lot of stuff with the improvisation. At least, I think so. My theory’s not as good as it used to be… Anyway, here’s the lyrics: You’d be so nice to come to You’d be so nice by the fire While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby You’d be all that I could desire Under stars chilled by the winter Under an August moon burning above You’d be so nice You’d be paradise, to come home to and love There seems to be a lot of people in Japan who like this song.

Amazon started being unresponsive at around 11:55, and now it’s totally dead. I figured I’d blog about it, since I have a lot of free time waiting for the page to load. I think the main mechanics of who will get the Xbox will work like this: People who are “lucky” will actually get the page served to them. The chances of this happening are pretty slim, since there’s like a billion people frantically reloading at this point. Once you are “lucky” and get a page served to you, you must get “lucky” a few more times since you’ll have to check out and everything. I guess it would have been a good idea to set up that one click checkout thing at Amazon.com prior to this event. Anyway, people will slowly start getting the available boxes until they are all gone. Of course, the site will still be unresponsive long after all of the Xboxes are taken. This is because the continued unavailability of the site will cause people to think the deal is still on. And plus they can’t access the site since everyone is still frantically reloading. So who knows, maybe all the Xboxes are taken, and I’m just wasting time reloading and sitting here blogging about reloading… Update: they’re all gone. Well that was a waste of time…"

So now I’m once again wondering if I should get one. I’ve been getting my grad school applications ready, so it looks like I’ll be going to school again next Fall. If I make it in. Maybe I should just wait until then, because Apple might release something cool like an ultra portable tablet or something! Or maybe I should just say screw it and get a Macbook already. Amazon.com is having some rebates, so I could get one for $1100 – $75 = $1025. I’ll definitely end up getting a new laptop if I end up going to grad school, but it might be better for me to just wait and see if anything awesome comes out between now and next Fall… Oh, BTW, check out The Grad School Chronicles if you want to know more about my grad school adventures."

Some sites are discrete, while others don’t require a blogger to say that they’re getting paid to write the review.

The good thing about ReviewMe is that they don’t require positive reviews. So bloggers aren’t forced to shill a website or product. Something tells me, however, that bloggers who give nothing but bad reviews will probably end up not being called back. It’ll probably end up being an unspoken rule that positive reviews are preferred. Another observation: if people are so desperate that they need to pay people to write about their product, the product probably can’t be that good. On my anime blog, I write reviews on stuff for free. Occasionally companies will send me stuff to review, which is good enough for me! I can’t imagine a legitimate having to do more than that to get reviews. The bottom line: Will I keep using ReviewMe? Maybe, if anyone’s willing to pay for me to write about their stuff…"

I went into MacGyver mode and made a custom shiv out of one of the blades and a napkin. It worked okay, but it also made my hands really tired. Anyway, it took like, 20 minutes to get the top off of the damn thing. Then it took a few more minutes to scrape all of the crap from the inside out. Once we finished doing that, they announced that all participants had 5 minutes to finish their pumpkins… We ended up just trying to finish, but we both had class to go to. I took the pumpkin home and finished it there. Here’s the result! It’s really badly proportioned, since the pumpkin is huge and the face is tiny. I do like, however, having a pattern of an actual jack-o-lantern on a jack-o-lantern. It’s kind of meta, don’t you think?

This will most likely be my last one, since I’m gonna graduate in December. Not that I feel overly sentimental. I thought my last one was gonna be in 2002, but I ended up doing marching band this year on a whim. It was a pretty good end to a marching career. And by that, I mean the show was horrible. The music part was okay, but marching was crazy. First off, the hashes for the high school bands are about 4 steps away from our normal ones. This threw off pretty much every set. Next, the sun was shining directly on the grass, and I could barely even see where the lines were painted. That’s not all. For some reason, my throat got super dry, and by the end, I could barely play anything at all. Luckily this happened before I took my solo. There’s more! During the drum break (when all the difficult marching goes on), my shoelace got untied! So I had to sorta hop around and I got out of step multiple times. I guess a flute girl (who will remain unnamed) got lost, and I collided with her after doing an about face. I think that’s all the bad stuff that happened. Honestly, I think it was probably the worst show I have ever marched in my marching band career. Not that it’s necessarily a bad thing. It was actually pretty fun. Since UNM doesn’t get judged on their own field, it’s not like I had to worry about having points deducted or anything. Word from some spectators is that we sounded fine. I seriously want to get a hold of the tape, so I can post it (and see the collision)! Ah Zia, how I’ll miss you. Hinano, my friend from the podcast that I do, made up a comic about the event. That image up there is a panel from it. To see the whole thing, click here ."

        "content": "So just this morning, a host by the name of “Media Temple” started offering a new type of hosting. They call it “ Grid-Server ” and it seems to be a system of web servers running in parallel. It seems like one of those “why didn’t I think of that!” things (well, if you’re nerd, anyway). Most hosting services have single machines that will serve 5 or so users at once. The problem with these is that one user using many resources will slow down the rest of their neighbors’ sites too. I think this is what I’ve been doing with my sites… The whole idea of the grid thing is that each user will be on one large group of computers. If a user doesn’t use many resources, great. If the user uses many, the grid can accommodate that. Maybe. I’m really interested in this service and I might actually switch hosts. My host has been battling uptime for months now. I’m kind of getting tired of it. It really looks bad when Notecentric is down, since it’s supposed to let users access their notes ALL THE TIME. In fact, I may just order the service right now, and switch when my other hosting runs out. But what should I put on the mt host? Hmm…."

At first I thought the guy was just some kind of geniusly crafted alter ego. A lot of his videos involve post production (like him visiting himself from the future and talking to himself). The more I watch his videos, though, the more I think he’s actually a creepy guy. Here’s a video of him talking about eating boiled peanuts . So is he really creepy or fake creepy? You be the judge!"

The browser’s been open for a few hours now and it’s only (!?) taking up 100Mb of ram. I’ve got 6 tabs open. If this were the older version, I’m pretty sure we’d be at around 500. No joke. Firefox seems to be less sluggish, which is good. The visual theme has also been updated to look more shiny and glossy. I’ve also discovered that there’s an integrated spellchecker that works its magic on any textarea. Pretty awesome. I can’t wait for Firefox 2.0 to officially be released. Then, and only then, can I get a Firefox 2.0 t-shirt to commemorate the occasion."

Y’know, like pay tribute or something (even though I downloaded the music! Sorry Maynard!). I put “ Swingin’ For Schuur ” in my car, and when I got to “My Romance” I was like, “yeah!” I’d heard the song before, but sometimes these things need words for the whole package to click. I like memorizing words to standards for phrasing issues as well as trivia issues. One of the things I like about the song is that it’s totally self aware. Like it’s referencing other love songs that have sappy stuff in ‘em. Check out the lyrics: My Romance Rodgers &amp; Hart My romance doesn’t have to have a moon in the sky My romance doesn’t need a blue lagoon standing by No month of may No twinkling stars No hideaway No soft guitar My romance doesn’t need a castle rising in Spain Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain Wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dreams come true My romance doesn’t need a thing but you If I ever sing this song in a karaoke setting or something, I want to replace “soft guitar” with “girl from mars.” That’ll be so awesome! The Maynard version is actually a pretty cool arrangement. The Bill Evans one is also really good."

Anyway, I thought I’d write about my impressions of the sequel to probably the best game ever. So far, this game is pretty much like the original Disgaea. That’s a good thing. The story is different, but almost everything is the same as the original. For example, the grid based movement system is back. The lifting and throwing system is still there. The geo panel stuff is also still present. Basically the only thing that has changed are the characters and the setting. As for the story, it’s ok. It centers around a human, Adell, trying to summon a powerful demon overlord into changing his family back into humans. They were turned into demons a few years back. He ends up summoning the overlord’s hot daughter, Rozalin instead. The story can get a little heavy sometimes with Adell being emo, but for the most part it’s pretty funny. The only new feature I’ve noticed so far is the felony system. I didn’t really look into it that much, but commiting crimes basically means that your demon has certain advantages in the game. The crimes I commited so far are “Geo Vandalism” and “High RES.” They seem kind of random. I might write about Disgaea 2 some more once I’ve gotten more into it. For now, I think I better regulate my playing, or this might not turn out to be my last semester of college after all!"

It’s just an applications class for Business majors, so it probably won’t be too hard. Mostly stuff in Word and Excel I think. Hopefully I’ll pass Software Engineering, and graduate in December!

Ambition Killed The Cat While it’s sad to learn that the cat perishes in this shirt, it’s still pretty damn cute. This is a reprint, so I guess tons of people bought it and wanted more. Good job for bringing it back! Now go vote for this shirt to be reprinted! Do it! Yep, so a few good shirts from threadless.com this week. Not that they’re good enough for me to buy for full price.

Mr. Jackson is very convincing, and I’m kinda scared that he’ll kill me if I don’t see Snakes on a Plane. This is pure genius viral marketing, right here. The only complaint I have is that SLJ doesn’t know how to say a lot of names. Including “Hung.” Oh, I guess it would’ve been cool if he had dropped the F-bomb a few times, or even if he just said “ass” instead of “butt.” Oh, if you didn’t know, Snakes on a Plane is a movie. About snakes. On a plane. And Samuel L. Jackson’s in it. It’s already gained cult status for having a cheesy plot. I read somewhere that Samuel L.

There’s some other digital download things too, like the game manual and some mouse cursor or something. There’s also a different package for $65 that only doesn’t include the manga. Lame. The way I calculate it, the video game is worth $50 (or more; I’ve been waiting forever for it!), the manga will probably be worth $10, and the strategy guide would be $20. Add another $10 for the soundtrack and $75 isn’t looking so bad. Plus I get to support my favorite video game company ever, Nippon Ichi!

You give it an artist or a song that you like, and Pandora creates a radio station that plays music it thinks you’ll like. For instance, I made a “Toasters” radio station, and it mostly plays ska. The idea is that you’ll find new music you’ll like and buy tons. It seems like their algorithm is pretty complicated: Together we set out to capture the essence of music at the most fundamental level. We ended up assembling literally hundreds of musical attributes or “genes” into a very large Music Genome. Taken together these genes capture the unique and magical musical identity of a song – everything from melody, harmony and rhythm, to instrumentation, orchestration, arrangement, lyrics, and of course the rich world of singing and vocal harmony. It’s not about what a band looks like, or what genre they supposedly belong to, or about who buys their records – it’s about what each individual song sounds like. It’s actually done a pretty good job of finding music I like. The Aquabats station plays a lot of music I already own and like. The other songs are okay too. After playing with it for a few days, I have a few complaints. First, they repeat themselves way too much. I’ve heard The Toaster’s “Can I Get Another” like, four times already! Next, they only let you skip so many songs every hour. You can get around this by making more than one station and switching them (which will play a new song!). Other than the weak variety of songs, Pandora seems to work pretty well. It’s at least nice to have free music that you’ll probably like streaming automatically."

Usually they go for $300 new plus like $50 for shipping. Plus you have to wait two weeks! In all, I’m calculating that I saved about $100 (after I sell the extra games).

It will become aware of your treachery, flip out, and kill people. Making Japanese tea near your PS2 will cause it to return to the ether stream from whence it came. Do not place your PS2 near an air conditioner. ACs hate other appliances. Didn’t you watch The Brave Little Toaster? Do not plug your Playstation 2 in during a thunderstorm. You will instantly die. Do not stab your power cord with a broadsword. The Xbox360 will totally fubar your discs. Get a PS2 instead. Your Playstation 2 is already black. It does not need to get a tan. Do not insert Staryu, Luvdisc, or any other Pokemon into your Playstation 2. This isn’t a freakin’ Gamecube! Do not install a flip top loader. Sony DRM will take your hand if you do. Do not let your little brother play with the Playstation 2. He’s an idiot. Pwnd! Do not go backpacking to the Swedish Alps while leaving your Playstation 2 unplugged in your transparent house. This is just common sense. The following are from the US version of the PS2 manual: Do convice your mom that Playstation 2 is more important than groceries. Make her buy one in the rain. That’ll teach her for making daddy leave us! Do not let your mom try to play Rez with the trance vibrator in the bathtub with the shower on. Hey, your mom is hot! Damn it! Tell your mom to clean somewhere else! And make me a sandwich!"

        "url": "/blog/2006/06/22/how-to-stop-rss-scrapers-from-stealing-your-content-plus-revenge/",
        "content": "I noticed a while back in my Technorati blog backlinks thing that a certain blog was reposting all of the articles from my anime blog. It was an RSS Scraper that ran on some software called “Autoblogger Pro.” Basically, the site scraped posts from a number of anime blogs and reposted the content with adsense ads. While I didn’t mind the link back, it still bugged me that the person who set this up was simply profiting from other people’s work. I figured I’d do something about it. The first thing I noticed was that all comments on the blog were turned off. This makes sense, since every comment would have probably been “stop stealing my content, you jackass!” There wasn’t any contact info or even an “about” page. I decided that contacting the owner of the website wouldn’t have helped anyway. It was time to take matters into my own hands. As a Computer Scientist, I’ve learned to think as an adversary. For most automated systems, there’s usually a way to exploit some sort of flaw. I just had to figure out the weakness in Autoblogger Pro. In this case, the weakness is that everything is automated via RSS scraping. If they can’t get my RSS feed, they can’t scrape it. The first thing I had to do was find their IP address. I used the dns lookup tool here to find the IP of the website. Note that the website’s IP is not necessarily the one that’s pulling the feed. It was in my case, though. Just to be safe, I checked out my logs to see if that IP was pulling my feed. Bingo! They were pulling the feed every few hours. In order to stop them from accessing the feed, all I’d have to do is deny that IP. It’s pretty simple with .htaccess’ rewrite engine. Now, you could simply throw a forbidden 403 code, but where’s the fun in that? Sure, your site isn’t indexed anymore, but what about all the other sites whose content is being stolen? Someone has to stand up to these bullies! I decided to make a fake RSS feed to redirect to. This one would have 1000 entries in it, each 1 minute apart from the last. This would muddy up their site, and disallow anyone from actually seeing the stolen content. The fake feed would be auto-generated at the time of request, so each time they pulled the feed, it would be recent. I wrote this in my rails application, but it would probably be just as easy in php. Then I made my .htaccess forward to the fake rss for addresses coming from that ip’s location. RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} ^209.200.12.(.*)$ RewriteRule .* http://www.thebadrss.com/feed(not really the fake feed) [R,L] Voila! After waiting a while for the scraper to pick up the feed, I was happy to see the results . You’ll notice that I inserted random numbers into each entry, just to make sure they were all unique. I thought that maybe the software could detect duplicate entries. This might not work for all content stealers, but if enough people start spamming the spammers, maybe they’ll stop. I’d really love to see the look on their face when the guy running this site sees what’s become of it! Full Disclosure: I actually run an RSS aggregator of sorts, myself. It’s called Anime Nano. There are a few differences, though. First off, it’s opt in. Second, it’s a community of readers and bloggers who like anime, not a one-man profit machine. Third, visit it at animenano.com !"

Before, I had gone with rectangly square glasses. Last time, I moved up to semi-rimless (on the top) glasses. This year, I’m not sure. I was thinking of getting totally rimless glasses, so that it doesn’t look like I’m wearing glasses at all! But thick black frame glasses are kinda cool, and make you look like a hipster. But that might be a bad thing! So here’s the deal, I used this weird online try on glasses thingamajig, and got screencaps. It worked fairly well, and you can sorta get the idea of how glasses will look on my head once worn. So help me decide! Here’s the categories: Emo Yeah, they’re kinda not trendy and kinda lame now. Or are they? Here’s a bunch of the cool thick framed glasses that the guy from Weezer likes to wear: Round Round glasses generally look bad on my face. Incidentally, there are John Lennon glasses that are made by… John Lennon! He has his own glasses company! Crazy! These types of glasses generally make me look like Asian Harry Potter. Which is bad. Square Square glasses look fairly okay on my head, because my head is rectangly. Or something like that. Here’s some fully framed square glasses. Semi-Rimless: Top These are the kind I have right now. There’s a rim on top, and no rim on bottom. Personally, I think it still kinda looks weird. Semi-Rimless: Bottom Typically, the only people who can pull off the bottom-rimmed glasses are to be found in anime. But hey, they were there so I tried a few on my e-face. Totally Rimless I was thinking of getting these kind. They make you look like you’re almost not wearing glasses at all! But then what’s the point? I dunno. But they seem cool to me. Bad Glasses Okay, so this isn’t a voting choice, but I thought I’d highlight some of the really bad looking frames that I found. These are mostly aviators and ladies’ looking glasses. I told ‘em I was a guy! Here’s a picture of me without glasses, just in case you want to vote for that choice (not there’s a chance in hell that I’ll get contacts!). Anyway, the deadline is pretty soon (like tomorrow is my appointment) so vote early! If there’s a particular set of frames you find alluring, let me know in the comments section!

For those who are interested, it’s written purely in Ruby on Rails. I learned the language, learned some css skills, and wrote the project in about 3 weeks. RoR is a cool way to produce web application code in an Object Oriented paradigm. I’m losing most of you, aren’t I? My next web app is still a secret, but I’ll let you know when that hits.

I used it a couple of times to earn like, $1 by identifying buildings before I got bored as hell and quit. Anyway, it looks like someone has finally put this to good use by hiring people to draw sheep facing left. 10,000 of them! I’m kinda disappointed that I didn’t know about this. I coulda been part of internet history! And been paid 2 cents! If you click on the little thumbnail, it actually shows you the strokes that it took to draw the sheep. Pretty cool.

Not everyone uses firefox, though they should (even if it eats all of your memory). Since the new Macbooks came out, I’ve sorta wanted to get one, but it seems there’s still some issues. List time! Pros: Runs Mac OSX Runs Windows XP Runs Ubuntu Linux Is fairly cool Cons: Is fairly hot Thermal Paste = badly applied ? Super shiny screen! Has flaky paint job? Now, the Macbook has only been out for like, a week, and all these issues have been brought up? I could probably wait a little bit until they resolve all (or at least most) of these. I checked the student discount I get from UNM. Normal price is $1100, student price is $1070… Amazon.com has the Macbook for $1100 – $100 and no tax, so I’d probably get it there.

It has a picture of a tooth under an umbrella… Random Buddhist Charms My brother told me these were to hang in my car so I don’t get into so many car wrecks. I actually have a Mr. T air freshener protecting my car right now, so I pity the fool who tries to smash into it! Ichigo Candy So this candy says “ichigo” on it, which means strawberry. It also says “ramune” like the drink. I haven’t opened it yet, but it looks sorta pez-like in nature. Melonpanna Stamp This Melonpanna thing is a character from some anime. The base comes off and has a hidden stamp! Melonpanna spins frantically when you use the stamp. Pretty cool, but I wish it had a melon pan scent to it too… Also pictured is the capsule that the toys came in, and the Final Fantasy Advent Children insert thingy. Naruto Phone Thing Sweet! It’s a Naruto phone thingy. You strap it onto your phone like a Japanese schoolgirl. It appears as though Naruto is either jumping, or on the ground in pain. I vote for the latter. He seems to do that a lot. Random Bubblegum This bubblegum comes in three flavors: Cola, Grapefruit, and (tsubu tsubu?) Ichigo. It looks pretty good, so I’ll be consuming this shortly. Roz from Final Fantasy Advent Children Believe it or not, I haven’t actually seen the movie yet, so I have no idea who this is. Cloud or Tifa would’ve been so awesome, but this is cool too. Is this guy a Turk or something? I hardly remember the plot for Final Fantasy VII… Super Mario Flashplate Apparently, this is a pretty rare item. It’s a diorama with an lcd on it, and it flashes using solar power. It’s the thing in Super Mario Brothers where you can get the koopa troopa on a step, and get infinite 1-ups by jumping on it while it bounce back at you.

Whenever I switch applications, I have to go find which one I want in the tray on the bottom (with the number of apps I use at once, alt-tab is a bad idea). Sometimes I have to go through 10 or more windows to find what I’m looking for! With two monitors, I could have a web browser one (for example), and a work one. Because, yes, web browser != work. Or I should say, web browser = !work. While it would be nice to have a dual monitor setup, it would also cost twice as much. And I bet movies wouldn’t look too good with the gap in the middle.

Inspired by the Hollywood blockbuster hit, “ Super Troopers “, this year’s event pitted Eric Oliver (on the left) versus Jordan Sayre (on the right). The competition seemed to be evenly matched at first. Both men had finished about 10% of their bottles, respectively. Then something incredible happened. Jordan Sayre pulled ahead with a strategy known as “squeezing the bottle.” He won by quite a large margin. As a finishing taunt, Jordan said to Eric, “finish up!” Eric reluctantly finished his bottle as the loser of the competition. The second annual Soundpack Syrup Chugging Contest is currently being planned for the Spring of 2007 in sunny Las Vegas, Nevada. Note: Do not try this at home. All parties involved in the chugging contest eventually barfed all the syrup (and their dinner) after the competition was over. It was gross."

        "content": "So I had this weird dream last night that I was auditioning for American Idol. I haven’t been watching the show this season, but I guess that it somehow seeped its way into my subconscious mind (actually, I think it’s probably because my friend Mark asked me if I was watching it). I was in a group of about 30 or so people auditioning. First, we took a tour of the American Idol facilities (which I don’t really think exist). They mainly consisted of empty rooms and hallways. It was sort of like a cross between Costco and a warehouse. After the tour, they split up the guys and the girls (just like in the show!) and the girls auditioned first. They all went into the audition room together. Whenever a girl would walk out of the room, you could hear music (it was sort of like a rock concert in there). The guys’ turn came up, but unlike the girls, we had to go one by one. It was at this point that I realized I was auditioning for American Idol, and should probably figure out what I was going to sing. I wasn’t really thinking about it before. As my turn grew nearer and nearer, the only song I could think to sing was “Isn’t She Lovely?” by Stevie Wonder, but I didn’t want to do that because everyone sings that! Plus I only know the first 6 words… I was also thinking of singing a weird Of Montreal song that would totally confuse the judges. My friends started calling me on my cell phone, and I was like, “not now, I have figure out what I’m gonna sing for my American Idol audition!” They were excited, but I think they still just wanted to talk about their own stuff. Next thing I know, I’m at home reading my email, and my friend sends me a message saying that he saw my audition on American Idol. This is in the strange chronology of my narrative dream. I don’t remember actually auditioning, but I guess I did… Anyway, there’s a link in the email to the video clip! Before I got a chance to click on it to watch myself audition (for the first time), I woke up. I guess I’ll never know whether I made it or not…"

I’m thinking either you’ll die instantly, or grow to enormous proportions (in your mind) and then die. I smell an impending lawsuit will happen when a kid decides to eat the mushroom (thinking he’s now got an extra life) and jumps off a cliff. Even without eternal life-giving properties, I want this.

Cold-Eeze is like a cough drop, but it has some special Zinc ingredient in it. From my understanding, the Zinc coats your throat and prevents the cold virus from replicating. One note: the stuff tastes really gross, and it sort of stays in your mouth long after the lozenge is gone. Imagine eating the peel of a banana. Kick it down a notch and you have Cold-Eeze. Last time I had a cold, I tried using Cold-Eeze to decrease the length of it. I used it the late in day after I felt like I was getting sick, so I ended up being sick for more than a week. This time, I took it right away, even before I was sure that I was sick. Today, Thursday, I feel about as good as I did on Sunday. I’m definitely past the hump. In my experience, I’ve had colds that have been a lot worse (I didn’t really feel all that sick during the worst days, Tuesday and Wednesday) and they’ve lasted a lot longer too. Yes, I graphed my sickness levels with gnuplot. I'm a nerd. I wouldn’t say that Cold-Eeze cures anything; it just makes your cold shorter and weaker. Even if you’re skeptical about it, I’d say it’s worth it to have some lying around so you can test it yourself if you’re starting to feel sick. Maybe it is a placebo, but hey, whatever makes you feel better, right?"

        "content": "So today I got my package from Jlist containing all of the sweet nerd stuff that I’ve been waiting for! I got the Final Fantasy XII Potion (4 of them), a Question Mark Box Bank (with character inside), a sound effect Capsule Toy, and a busted pouch of Pocari Sweat (I didn’t ask for it to be busted). First, the Final Fantasy Potion: Yes, that’s my hand in the picture. Maybe I should be a hand model… Anyway, the bottles were a bit smaller than I envisioned. I’m going to be drinking the potion along with my cousin, who ordered 2 with me. I was thinking of doing a video review or something. I’ve heard it tastes like medicine, but I think I’m getting a slight cold, so maybe the potion will cure it! Next, the Question Mark Box Bank: Yep, it’s a bank shaped like the box in Mario that you hit to make a coin or whatever appear. I tried punching it. It just made my hand hurt. I envisioned it would be bigger than it actually turned out to be. It can probably hold like, $1 worth of change. Yay. It also came with a keychain character. I got a blooper. He came in a little protective baggie. I like it. Next up, the other Sound-Making Keychain! There are six of these keychains in all, but I ordered one and got a random one. It makes the Mario swimming sound. It’s a lot bigger than I thought it would be, and I dunno if I should walk around with it as a keychain. It could go off in my pants without warning! Check out my quick demo video of it in action! Last but not least (well, probably both) is the Busted Pouch of Pocari Sweat (try saying that five times fast!): I’m going to ask Jlist if they’ll send me an unbusted one. It sort of got all over the other stuff and made it look like I got some cocaine with my order. True, there’s still some mix in the pouch, but now that it’s open, I dunno if I wanna ingest it. For all I know, it IS cocaine!!! EDIT: Jlist wrote back saying that they’d send me a replacement. How cool are they!? So yeah. That’s it. If you wanna be cool like me and get crazy stuff from Japan, check out Jlist . They’ve got some neat stuff. Shipping is kind of a lot, but if you buy in bulk, it becomes somewhat reasonable."

It basically argues that, while most people believe they are above average in competence versus everyone else, it’s impossible for that to be true for the majority of people. It also concludes that people who think they are superior are actually unaware of their incompetance, and the more competent people might sell themselves short, because they are better able to assess their shortcomings as well as others’. In short, the study showed that the researchers’ predictions were spot-on. Participants scoring in the bottom quartile grossly overestimated their test performance and ability, and analysis confirmed that this miscalibration was due to deficits in metacognitive skill (the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error). This sort of begs the question: Would you rather be a confident idiot, or an unsure genius? I guess thinking about it damns you either way. It also reminds me of the Japanese saying, baka wa kaze wo hikanai: Idiots can’t catch colds (because they’re too stupid to realize they have them). Of course, the people who did the research could have just been overestimating themselves when they assumed they were running the experiments correctly…"

        "content": "So today I decided to take a somewhat dusty, unopened version of Guilty Gear Isuka (that I bought from Amazon.com for $10) off the shelf and actually play it! I’m something of a crazy game buyer (I buy them when they’re cheap), and I have way too many to actually play them all. Anyway, I popped it into my PS2 and was immediately confused. Guilty Gear Isuka is a sprite-based fighter, kind of like Street Fighter 2. It’s also probably one of the last in a dying breed of games. This Guilty Gear is actually the first one I’ve ever played (though I’ve seen it being played in the Genshiken anime!). The graphics are top notch, and the cool factor is definitely there. I figured, “if it’s cool enough for hardcore otaku, it’s cool enough for me!” I think I’m getting old. Sure, the moves are all fireball/hold back forward type moves, but there’s other complicated things built in. The game supports 4 players at once, which is kinda cool, but that means you have to do your own turning. Also, I found that in the middle of a battle, the game’ll say something like “Joker has appeared!” and throw you into a two on one battle. Totally not fair! I have a feeling that in my youth, I’d have probably spent more time on this game (memorizing moves, continuing a billion times after dying), but I just don’t have it in me anymore. Give me my tried and true Tekken fighting style, and I’ll get Heihachi on your ass!"

They’re the band that did the theme, and they offer a free MP3 of it for download! Pretty cool how stream of consciousness web browsing works, huh? They’ve also got some other clips of their songs too. The singer has this cool sultry voice, and the music is in a new genre that they define as “Dreamy Pop.” I especially like the song “ Trampoline ,” though I wish the clip was longer. They seem like a fairly indie band, so maybe I’ll buy their CD."

There aren’t geeks that are as trendy as that! Certainly not ones that eat at Taco Bell! I mean, as far as geeks go, I’m as cool as they get…"

The whole list is pretty much dominated by RPGs with a Mario game here and a Sonic game there. Strangely, Super Mario RPG didn’t make the list. Another thing I noticed was that Final Fantasy X-2 sat pretty high at 32nd place. It beat The Legend of Zelda. Think about that. The. Legend. of. Zelda. I think the Japanese have finally lost it.

Every Tuesday, another present will be unwrapped, whether it be screenshots, game music, or screenshots. Hey Mother 3 people, get more creative! Mother 3 is coming to the Gameboy Advance, which means I can play it on my Nintendo DS. I really liked Earthbound a lot (though not as much as my cousin), so I might import it and struggle through the Japanese to play it. The graphics are going to be just as spritey as on the SNES version, so I have a feeling this game will be retro RPGing at its best. Mother 3 will be released in Japan on 4-20-06, so until then, be satisfied with the “presents.”"

It’s still kind of expensive, so maybe I’ll wait ‘til I strike it rich. iPod Hi-Fi The new iPod is… not an iPod. Bummer. The iPod hi-fi is just an overpriced jukebox that you can stick your iPod on. iYawn. It seems that Apple is tired of letting all the third-party manufacturers profit from the iPod, so now they’re making overpriced accessories as well. The iPod hi-fi costs $349. iPod Leather Case Speaking of overpriced accessories, check out iPod Leather Case! Only $99! If this is a “fun new product” for Apple, I’m not impressed. It doesn’t even provide access to anything while the iPod is in the case! So there you have it, Apple’s fun new products.

It would have to be a huge emergency for a $12.50 potion, though! This comic makes a lot more sense now too. It pretty much describes my behavior during all the Final Fantasy games. Why use a phoenix down when a mage can use life? The mage is dead? Oh, I guess we have a catch-22 on our hands. I’m still not using that phoenix down, though. Don’t even get me started on the subject of Elixir hoarding… I also used to calculate the cost efficiency of using an ether on a mage to cast healing spells, rather than buying potions to heal. Then I’d calculate which healing spell (cure1 vs cure2 vs cure3) would be most MP cost efficient (because casting cure3 on a guy that only needs like, 300 hp is just stupid). Seriously, that’s how big of a nerd I was. Anyway, getting back on track, anyone wanna split a case of Final Fantasy XII potion with me? Update: Play-Asia.com has the premium potion in stock for $12.90, though I think shipping is cheaper. If you wanna go the cheap route, go with Jlist.com. They have the regular bottle for $4.50 . That’s the one I went with."

Some wonderfully pissed person has made a video showing exactly how long it takes to load Smackdown vs. Raw 2006 on a PSP. Thankfully, they overlay the audio with the music from Benny Hill, which makes it somewhat bearable. I believe the issue here is that the designers of the game decided to put all of the crap that was in the PS2 version and just stick it into the PSP without considering anything. Instead of making a game for the PSP, they just crammed too much in there. My favorite part of the video is where it takes about 10 seconds for the game to load up… the loading screen!

In fact, they’re probably my favorite band, at the moment. My favorite band used to be They Might Be Giants, because of their nerdy lyrics and infectious melodies. Lately, though, they’ve been veering off course and going into some bad territory. When every other release from a rock band is a kid’s album, something is wrong. I have a feeling they’ve sold out, and they’re “over the hill” now, so to speak. Anyway, back to the band at hand. Of Montreal is this crazy indie type band that plays just the kind of music I like. Insane music! The lyrics usually don’t make any sense, and when they do, they form some kind of grandiose plot, kind of like a rock opera. Many of their song names don’t even make sense. Just check out the tracklisting for their Early Four Track Recordings album. Weird. I think their more current albums are more synthesis/electronica based, whereas their older albums are more dirty lo-fi guitar sounding affairs (which isn’t a bad thing). Sure, they’re a might bit pretentious, but they’ve got the awesomeness to back it up. The albums I’ve bought from them are Early Four Track Recordings , and Aldhils Arboretum . Both are pretty awesome. The Gay Parade and Horse &amp; Elephant Eatery (No Elephants Allowed) are also really good. You can download a ton of MP3s from their website (legally, even!). I recommend The Problem With April and Nickee Coco and the Invisible Tree for starters. It’s really nice to find a band and actually become a fan; Something I haven’t done in quite a while. I really should actively look for new music to listen to, but I guess I’m kind of lazy when it comes to that. Maybe I’ll become an Of Montreal expert before I go looking for any more music…"

It started off with me and my friend Patrick playing Dance Dance Revolution. I was getting AAs and he was doing pretty badly. Then my friend Tim came over and told the two of us that he could get AAA on any song we were trying. What a bluff! I was curious as to see how Tim could be a DDR maniac, so we decided to drive to the mall (because I guess my home DDR wasn’t good enough?). Tim and Patrick drive away, and I’m still getting into my car (I dunno why we didn’t carpool). I remember that my cell phone is in my parents’ car, but I’m like, “I don’t need that!” I try to follow them but they’re gone. Somehow, I get lost on the way to the mall, and curse myself for not bringing my cell phone to call them. This is strange, because the mall is only like, a few blocks away from my house. Somehow me and Patrick end up in a school, and he wants to look around. It happens to be some voting day, and there’s a bunch of senior citizens in a room sitting in desks writing up their ballots. Then whoever’s in charge of the election starts kicking the old people out and ripping up their ballots because they’re taking too long to vote. I’m mad, and start yelling about how that’s illegal, and they should let the old people vote. Suddenly, one of the old people steals something out of my messenger bag (like my PDA or something) and I chase her! It’s one of those slow-motion dream chases. She’s really fast! She gets into her car and I can’t catch her! Later the police nab her, and I demand the death penalty, or at least the right to smack her down. I dunno if she ever got what was coming to her, but I was pissed. I don’t think I’d wish capital punishment on the elderly in real life, though. I guess it was just the frustration of running really slowly in the dream, and losing to an old lady in a race. Weird, huh?"

Unless you don’t live near me or ever come in contact with me. Then it’s ok): Nerd Berd Nerd Berd has a nerdy bird and a cool pattern on it. I’m a nerd, so naturally I like Nerd Berd. It’s also pretty cute. My favorite color is green, so it’s also a plus that the shirt’s main color is green. The only nerdier shirt I can think of would be one that had binary on it. Oh wait, I already have shirts with binary on them… What else can I say? I like the Nerd Berd, and hopefully it will like me back. Human Concept I’m not really sure I know what the meaning of Human Concept is. What I do know, however, is that elephant looks way cool! And it’s crossing the street! At an elephant crossing! This elephant is majorly detailed. It reminds me of one of the animals that O’ Reilly (not Bill O’ Rielly!) uses for their books. It’s in Khaki, which means it will go great with my… blue jeans! Predicament Predicament is a shirt with a guy fishing on a giant fish! I guess his predicament is what he does after he catches the fish. It looks like the fish has already caught him! This shirt must take place in Soviet Russia! I picked this shirt because it looks cool. I mean, why else would I pick a shirt, right? I’d prefer it in a different color, but blue works. The sky is blue, and so is water. And there’s both sky and water in this shirt! Looking at these purchases, it seems there’s pattern. Yep, all these shirts have animals on em. I don’t think I planned this when I bought em, it just happened that way. Or maybe I just prefer animals on my shirts rather than precocious artist trash! Whoa, I think I need some sleep now.

Too bad Mario gets hit right after he gets the flower. I wanted to see him spit fire! Damn that annoying Lakitu bastard! Another thing: When Mario gets turned into little Mario and picks up the fire flower for the first time, guess what happens? Nope, he doesn’t turn into big Mario (that’s what would’ve happened in the original Super Mario Bros.), he turns into fire Mario! Yes, the greatest wish of my 9 year old self has come true! Damn, I’m a nerd!"

I’ll wait for the reviews personally. Sure, everything that Nippon Ichi does is money in the bank, but this game was actually developed by Idea Factory. That said, it might not be the SRPG I’m looking for. If only Nippon Ichi would develop for the Nintendo DS… Now that would be something!"

In case you don’t know, “IT” stands for “Information Technology” and basically means the department that fixes all the computer problems and controls the technology of a company. Yes, this show is geared towards nerds. The two guys are computer nerds, and the new girl knows nothing about computers. Blatant stereotypes aside, this show is very smart. The mise-en-scene in the basement has random computer parts everywhere, and geeks in the know will recognise the EFF stickers posted on pretty much everything. The great part about this show is that on top of being funny, it’s also super random. I guess the British have a better appreciation for random crazy humor than Americans. My only major gripe has to do with the addition of a laugh track. I don’t need people telling me when to laugh! It seems to have a very limited target audience, but hopefully this show will keep going for a long long time. (You can find The IT Crowd at your friendly neighborhood bittorrent tracker)"

Hell, that’s probably how this game was originally designed. Anyhow, I feel the map speaks for itself . This is really distressing. I’m assuming this is some kind of parody thing, but Chicago is some kind of mega fortress, Alaska has an ice palace, Montana seems to be some kind of Neko City, and Saint Paul has a giant one of those bird things that drink water! Most of America also seems to be covered in impassable mountain terrain. At least they had a location from New Mexico: Carlsbad Caverns!

Actually, I don’t read shoujo manga either; I watch the anime… Anyway, the exhibit goes through three time periods of shojou manga from the 1960s all the way to the present. The art seemed pretty cool, and I was surprised at times how “modern” the stuff from the 70’s looked. I was hoping there’d be more Yuri and less Yaoi , but what can ya do!? We also got to talk to Masami Toku (the director of the project) briefly about the history of shoujo manga.The exhibit runs until around the middle of the month (I think), so if you’re at UNM, check it out at Maisley Gallery. I also snuck out with a copy of Shoujo Beat Manga Sampler! “Snuck out” not as in stealing (it’s free after all) but as in getting away with it as a guy. Man, can’t they label these manga something else, like “masculine” and “not quite as masculine?” Honestly though, I don’t care if people know I read shoujo manga, I mean, I’m writing about it on my blog right?

        "content": "Today in my Computer Game Development class, someone from Novint (a local company specializing in haptic devices) showed a demo of the Novint Falcon . What’s a haptic device? It’s sort of like a game controller that can provide feedback in all directions. There were some texture demos, and a few games like launch the duck, where you grab a duck in a slingshot, pull it back, and let go. The cool thing is you can feel opposing force when you pull the duck back. It doesn’t feel quite perfect yet, but I believe it’s still in development. It was still really fun moving this device around (the one we used didn’t have a pen, it was more like a door knob), and feeling it respond. I have a feeling that this device will end up being a novelty, unless it sees huge support from every developer in the world. Sure, it can be used for other stuff like medical simulations, but in the field of video games, I’m not too sure it’ll take off. Here’s the official company line: The Novint Falcon, which is designed to retail for under $100, is the only consumer device to provide three-dimensional, high fidelity force feedback. Unlike any consumer force feedback product on the market, the Novint Falcon enables users to move right and left, forward and backwards, like they do with other devices, plus up and down. Users can now experience a full range of realistic touch sensations including shape, texture, weight and dynamics. The Novint Falcon connects to a PC through a USB port and its footprint is approximately 9”x 9”, comparable to a mousepad and most joysticks or peripherals."

It details my harrowing journey to the arcade… So last weekend, a couple of out-of-town buddies called me up and wanted to hang out. Their idea? Go to the mall. A trip to the mall isn’t really my idea of a good time, but I hadn’t seen those guys in a while, so off we went. While at the mall, the subject of DDR came up. I’m not one to go to the mall often (probably 3-4 times a year), so naturally I don’t play DDR at the arcade that often either. Oh, I guess the title of this post is kinda misleading then. It wasn’t my “first” DDR Arcade experience; Just the first one where I was actually capable completing a song on my own… Anyway, it was decided that if Natrick* payed, Burtis* and I would dance for him. And dance we did. Did I mention there’s videos? Yes, luckily my New Year’s resolutions did not involve refraining from embarassing myself in front of the internet. So here’s the result of our escapades: Your browser does not support the video tag. First we warmed up with “Get up ‘n Move.” I think this was on standard difficulty. I hadn’t really played at the arcade before, and my feet kept getting stuck where the arrows are. I guess I need drag my feet less (it’s easy when it’s just the dance mat!). There was a crowd of people behind us, but after realizing me and Burtis sucked, they all ran away to Hot Topic or something. Your browser does not support the video tag. Next off, we played “Look to the Sky” on standard mode. I forget which mix it was. I thought I combo’ed through it and would get a AA, but I only got an A. This is when Burtis thought it would be a good idea to stop trying to stay alive and start showboating. I have to admit it, though, he’s a great dancer. He even got a bunch of little kids to watch us! Your browser does not support the video tag. Finally, we decided to go out with a bang and play “Mobo Moga” on heavy mode. I can sometimes AA this one at home if I’m lucky. Anyway, I tried to keep us alive, but it was for naught. We failed somewhere in the middle. If only Burtis would have concentrated!!! Overall, it was a pretty fun excursion. I like the coolness of the metal pad, but it’d take some time to get used to. I think red octane sells a metal pad like the arcade, but it’s like, $200! Maybe I’ll buy a DDR Machine when I become a millionare… *names have been changed to protect the innocent"

Rate of thought during waking hours (10 per second) = 36000 thoughts per hour Rate of thought during sleeping hours = 3600 thoughts per hour Number of thoughts per day = 604800 thoughts per day\\ How many roses are sprinkled with dew? Depends on the current season, humidity levels, dewpoints, time of day, etc. How far would I travel to be where you are? Assuming both of us are on the Earth, the farthest you could travel (taking the shortest path) is half of the Earth’s circumference: 20037.58 km (assuming you are traveling along the surface of the earth) How far is the journey from here to a star? The closest star to the Earth is the Sun, which is on approximately 1AU from Earth. The next closest star is Proxima Centauri, which is approximately 250,000AU away.

I was curious as to what me dream meant (beside being a ghost of November 28 future), so I looked up shaving on dreemmoods.com. So apparently it means that: To dream that you are shaving, suggests that you are making a minor life-changing decision. Some aspect of your daily routine is being altered. Alternatively, it may represent your severe attitude or self- punishment. Of course, it could just mean that I didn’t shave all Thanksgiving weekend, and that I need a shave right now!"

You can read a few pages in the book too, but they don’t let you read the whole book, which would be awesome. Anyway, I guess it’s a good tool for finding books, and also a nice tool to use for writing papers if you’re doing it last minute and you need some references… Oh yeah, about that paper, I guess I should get started, eh?"

Here they are: Dirty Dustin Hoffman Needs A Bath Dustin Hoffman Gets A Bath Dustin Hoffman Thinks About Eating Soap Dustin Hoffman Scrubs Too Hard And Loses Soap Dustin Hoffman Does Not Resist Temptation To Eat The Bathtub Dustin Hoffman’s Wife Comes Home Dustin Hoffman’s Wife Seems Suspicious About The Absent Tub Dustin Hoffman Feigns Ignorance Of Missing Bathtub Dustin Hoffman’s Wife Calls In Detective To Dust For Porcelain Particles On Dustin Hoffman’s Tongue Dustin Hoffman’s Tongue Taken To Police Lab Where It Is Used As Toilet Paper and Reading Material While On The Toilet Dustin Hoffman Offers Lame Possible Explanation For Missing Bathtub Dustin Hoffman’s Wife Makes A Sarcastic Remark, Cuts The Head Off A Duck, Places It Where The Tub Was and Begins To Growl Dustin Hoffman Becomes Indignant And Wets Himself Dustin Hoffman Quits Bathroom And Climbs A Tree Dustin Hoffman’s Children Enter The Bathroom Dustin Hoffman’s Children Don’t Enter The Bathroom Seriously, how could I make this shit up even if I wanted to!?

Then I come up to a river, and it’s really clean and crystal clear. I don’t want to spit it out there, because I think it would be rude to mess up the really nice water with my Listerine spit. I follow the river and come up to a branch where there aren’t any people. I just decide to spit the Listerine out there because no one is watching. It feels good having the Listerine out of my mouth, but now I feel bad for hurting the environment. What does it mean!!!"

By the name of Patrick Truong!!!! _BARRISTER P.T.GEORGE PT George Chambers 3 Bode Thomas Victoria Island Lagos-Nigeria._ Dear Truong, I am BARRISTER P.T.GEORGE , a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney to Mr. Patrick Truong a national of your country, who used to work for National Electric Power Authority(N.E.P.A.) in Nigeria. Here in after shall be referred to as my client. On the 21st of April 2001,my client, his wife and their only daughter were involved in a car accident along Ikorodu express road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy here to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After theseseveral unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet,to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repartrating the fund valued at US$12.5million left behind by my client before it gets confisicated or declared unserviceable by the Bank where the above amount were deposited. The said Bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated within the next twenty one official working days. Inconceivable!"

Sounds like the real danger is paranoid/murderous kids. A knife? Come on, that kid was obviously trying to kill the other one using a cicada as a ruse. What is Looney Tunes teaching our kids!?"

This undermined my entire good dream, because then I was left trying to compensate for my newly acquired speech impediment. Looking in the mirror (the dream mirror), I found that my grin took on a rather pathetic visage. After a while, I figured I would try and reinsert the tooth, so I grabbed the tooth, which was now about 4 times larger than it was before, and quite filthy, and started jamming it into the socket. Of course, this didn’t hurt, it was a dream. After I somewhat successfully re-inserted the tooth, it was still a bit wobbly. This is when I woke up, and had to actually check to see if my tooth was really there or not. Let this be a lesson to you, kids. If you’re having a nice dream, please, do not try and remove one of your teeth, it’ll totally weird you out."

What do you think people thought when they first showed the Flintstones on tv, and Fred said “Yabba Dabba Dooo!” How long did it take before people stopped thinking, “Yabba what!? What the hell is this cartoon caveman saying!?” I’m thinking three weeks at least. Anyway, I bet people weren’t so confused at Scooby Doo later on, since they had already been De-sensitized to the whole “yabba dabba scooby dooby” stuff. That’s all."
