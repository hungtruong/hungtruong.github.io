      "content": "Vibe Coding Origins As generative AI has gotten better in the past months/years, I’ve been trusting it more to do stuff that I’d normally only trust myself to do. Earlier this year I started yet another refactor of my web app, Anime Nano, since I wanted to get it off of the $10 a month DigitalOcean host I was using. I decided to try using Cloudflare since it’s “serverless” and seems to be able to handle a buttload of traffic (which Anime Nano will never see). I usually reserve Anime Nano refactors (at this point they’re a pretty regular occurrence, as I’ve refactored it from Rails to Django, and using different databases and hosts, and deployment technologies like Chef and Docker) for technologies that I’m somewhat familiar with. Or technologies that I want to learn. At this point, though, I have a lot less patience for learning stuff that I’m unfamiliar with. I decided to try and let AI do most of the heavy lifting, and successfully used Google Gemini (I think it might’ve been 2.0 ...",

We recently moved (I guess it’s been like half a year now) to a house that only had “round” (short) toilets, so I lost the use of my butt-cleaning Toto C200 Washlet. I’ve been super busy with home projects and I only just got to the point where I could rectify (pun intended) this situation. I probably could’ve just attached a way too big bidet toilet seat to a way too small toilet, but whatever. I ended up buying a Toto Drake (meme incoming) toilet because everyone says it’s like the best toilet ever. I never really thought about comparison shopping toilets (or even shopping for a toilet) before, but I figured I might as well get the best one. So what if I bought the toilet just to make this joke? Installing The Toilet I guess this doesn’t really need to be in this post but I might as well include it for the sake of completeness. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on replacing toilets, since that’s how you learn anything these days. Once I w...",

So while I was learning about AI voice cloning technology to make myself sing better (and to make Kanye sing stupid songs), I got an idea into my head that I couldn’t let go of. I was reminicing about the original Talkboy Deluxe from the movie Home Alone 2 (and the subsequent commercial that played on kids tv for years after), and how it was supposed to change your voice but really it just kinda slowed it down. I realized that I could make the dream of the Talkboy come true, and do it with real life hardware. So here’s the story of how I made the Talkboy Ultra, which it turns out is a pretty fun toy. Building The Dream I knew that I wanted the Talkboy to be a real device, not just some app on a phone. Phone apps are cool, but there’s just something about single-purpose devices that ...",

I was recently stuck on a really long, 6 hour flight. Luckily, I had an internet connection the whole time, and I was testing out some nifty AR Glasses, so I watched a lot of YouTube. I remembered seeing a video about AI voice clone cover songs, where someone will take the voice of a known artist, and then make them sing a song by another artist (e.g. Kanye West singing “Call Me Maybe”), or they create a whole new original song for the artist (e.g. Drake singing an original called “Heart on My Sleeve”).

      "content": "Me speaking at iOSCon London 2018. Image copyright Ed Telling A few years ago, I made a goal for myself that I would start speaking at conferences. In the past I had gone to quite a few awesome conferences and I really admired the folks who could get on a stage, share a bunch of knowledge and inspire an audience to do cool stuff. While I had a bit of experience with public speaking (I spoke at some local iOS/Android meetups and moderated two panels at SXSW back in ’11 and ’13), I wanted to try for a “real” conference spot. I think the conference that convinced me to start applying was Swift Summit, which I attended in 2015. There were a number of really inspiring talks, and the community felt really fresh and welcoming. One interesting aside: I learned after joining Lyft that no fewer than three of my current coworkers on iOS spoke at that conference (Keith, Sam and JP, though only Keith was working at Lyft at the time) and a few others attended that year. I’m not sure if that’s cor...",

I’ve written before about getting hacked and I basically knew how to unhack myself, but I put it off for a bit until I checked my website again and noticed that Chrome was warning me to avoid it! This was pretty much the last straw. I decided to move off of self-hosted Wordpress and switch to something a bit more secure. I looked at some options such as Ghost or Hugo but it seemed like Jekyll was the most mature static blog platform, so I went with that. I used a plugin that would generate the Markdown files that I’d need to regenerate my blog. It also ended up transferring my image files, etc, which made it pretty easy to get started. I found a cool looking theme called Long Haul that I ended up modifying quite a bit. I updated the header image, changed up some colors and added an archives page and support for post excepts.

I thought that I could have mistaken it for my own phone, since iPhone X comes in two colors and you have a 50% chance of having the same phone color as any other person. I was thinking that if I did mistake it as my phone and entered my passcode, I’d basically be transmitting the key to all of my personal data. That led me to think about how hard it would be to reproduce the iPhone X’s lock screen and spoof one of my own. It turns out that with some experience with iOS development, it’s not that hard. Thanks to the iPhone X’s Super Retina display, a screen full of black pixels is indistinguishable from a device that’s asleep. And thanks to the omission of the home button, and a public API for disabling the swipe to go home gesture, I was able to make a pretty convincing copy of the iPhone X’s lock screen. Your mileage may vary if you’re trying to spoof other iPhone X models. Oh also I just ...",

Someone on Twitter put a bounty of $5 on the first fart app for the touch bar and a friend retweeted it to me. If you know me, you know that I like writing stupid apps and basically making a mockery of the Silicon Valley trope of “making the world a better place.” Specifically, the fart app genre appeals to me as a way to subvert the app ecosystem and make it a little more dumb and weird.

In recent years, solar panels have come down in price and now seemed like a good a time as any for me to experiment with it a bit. I took a week long staycation from work a few weeks ago, and in preparation, I did a bunch of research and bought a ton of components to set up an off grid solar thing. I chose to go off-grid because I didn’t want to deal with actually putting the power back into the grid and all the bureaucracy involved (I’m not sure if my power company even buys power back), and the scale I’m working at is super small anyway. Here are the components I used, and why I decided to go with them. They might not be the best choice, because I have no idea what I’m doing, but even so, I learned a lot in the process.

In this example, the app can detect when a user is arriving home and can ask if they want to switch the lights on.

In 2013 we got our wish, as Google started releasing Glass onto explorers and developers alike. In November of 2013, Google released a “Sneak Peek” of the GDK, a way to write native code for Google Glass. While the GDK is still under development and will probably change quite a bit before being finalized, those on the cutting edge will want to familiarize themselves with it. In this quick start guide, I’ll go through the steps of writing your first GDK app, “Where Am I?” This app will ensure you are never lost. By simply shouting “Okay Glass, where am I?” the app will find your latitude and longitude, and try to find the nearest street address. Prerequisites In order to start writing native apps for Google Glass, here’s what you’ll need: Google Glass! There is currently no way to emulate the device and its sensors, so getting a real device is a must. You can request an invite directly from Googl...",

I made a survey that asked participants to rank the five colors in order of awesomeness. The results surprised me. I was leaning towards white (cotton) and sky blue, but everyone seemed to really like tangerine (orange). Tangerine wins by a landslide!

I decided to learn a bit using the Big Nerd Ranch book, and once I went through enough examples I was confident enough to attempt recreating my Threadless app for Android. I was planning on reaching feature parity with the iOS app before releasing it, but I decided that a more frequent update cadence is probably better when it’s possible. The Google Play store makes it really easy to alpha and beta test, as well as promote beta builds to production. Rather than taking a week to find out that your app does not meet the requirements of Apple, you can simply push out a build and it’ll be ready in a few hours. This is probably one of the best “features” of being an Android developer. While Android has its fair share of “WTF” features, I actually kind of like it.

Today I’ll look at doing asynchronous tasks in each platform. While there are many ways of doing this in both platforms, I’ll take a look at Dispatch Queues for iOS and AsyncTask in Android, since that’s what I’ve been using lately. In iOS, you can use the dispatch_async call to run code on a background dispatch queue. Say we get an NSArray of JSON objects and want to save them to a Core Data store. We can call dispatch_async on a dispatch queue, process all of the objects and then update the UI by using dispatch_async again on the main queue: NSArray *stuff = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:responseDa...",

About a year ago I subscribed to PS Plus, which provides monthly installments of games for your PS3 and PS Vita/PSP if you have them. I was introduced to a bunch of cool games that I probably wouldn’t have bought otherwise like Saint’s Row 2, Borderlands. As a result, I ended up buying Saint’s Row 3 and Borderlands 2. It was also about a year ago that I built a PC for gaming. It’s kind of ridiculous how much cheaper it is to play games on a PC than to buy them for consoles.

I could either have a mediocre piece of code that sits around and keeps sucking, or I could post it to Github and anyone who wants to use it and possibly improve on it can. Not only does having code out there help your rep, but the act of putting it out there raises your standards quite a bit.

There’s no official API for getting audio, though. Luckily, I’ve never let a lack of an official API stop me before.

So far I’ve heard of plans from Digg, Flipboard, Zite (whatever that is), Feedly, and maybe some others. While this might be a good opportunity for those startups, it strikes me as odd. There’s a concept called being a “fast follower” where you copy some innovative company’s product immediately after they release it. Think of Facebook’s clone of that Snapchat app. What we’re seeing now is sort of the “slow(est) follow.” I suppose it makes sense to go into a space that you know is going to swell up with demand, but honestly, how much longer does the classic Google Reader style app have left?

So unless you want to do some weird hacking to get your overlay to show up over the normal controls and then have them disappear when the photo is taken, it’s not possible to use a custom overlay and still get the built in photo editing tool.

I’m not used to swiping up to get to the camera (it’s a new iOS 5.1 gesture)! Also, I have a theory that once something becomes sufficiently easy to do, there’s really no reason not to do it. So, while it lasts, please enjoy my photos of people walking their dogs outside my office window. Hopefully I will get a book deal soon.",

I recently took another look at it after it was renamed to “Google Play.” It’s suddenly making a bit more sense now that I’m trying it out again. Google Play (I’m really just talking about the music part) lets you upload all of your music to Google’s servers. This step seems kind of dumb but I guess for legal reasons they can’t just recognize your music and use their own copies of songs. I’m sure they’ve got the technology to do it. Anyway, once your music is uploaded you can play it from “the cloud.” While this seems like something so simple that Dropbox could do it, it’s the details that matter. In this case, Google offers a pretty neat interface to listen to your music (and buy more, if desired). I haven’t used iTunes Match personally, but from what I’ve read, it seems to do something similar. iTunes Match will scan your music ...",

The cereal was available for testing in cereal form, baked into a cookie, and blended into a smoothie (which was apparently made with apple cider and yogurt or something). Sidenote: While I was deciding what to taste test (I eventually went with the smoothie and it was not bad, and followed up with a chunk of cookie), an old Asian lady walked up to me and started talking in Chinese. I tried to tell her that I don’t really speak Chinese, but I forgot how to say “I don’t know Chinese” in Chinese.

Perhaps I am being cynical, but it’s always appeared to me that the main business model of a textbook publisher is to slightly tweak versions of a textbook, altering page numbers and quiz questions in order to force students to buy newer editions instead of used ones. Perhaps the industry is thinking that iBooks will eliminate the used book market, and they’re probably right. But this could also have some negative (for publishers) side effects as well. Apple is lowering the distribution costs of textbooks dramatically. Assuming that schools actually pay for a set of iPads for each student, it becomes trivially easy (with the iBook publishing software) to create free textbooks for schools. Who would want to give textbooks away for free? T...",

After that, I walked through the house some more and looked at the furnishings, thinking that I have a pretty cool brain for being able to invent that stuff on the fly.

I’ve noticed a whole lot of ticker updates since then from my friends’ playlists.

This is sort of weird because I recently switched to an SSD and none of my music is actually in my library. Yet I use Spotify for listening to stuff that’s not on my external hard drive (which I almost never have plugged in). I think this behavior might be due to the fact that Spotify is making me a fat kid in a candy store (but for music). I want to keep searching to test Spotify’s limits and see how much music it really has. So far it’s been doing really well.

It is quite jarring to see a password show up on my iPhone’s home screen. Here’s the email in case anyone needs proof: The fact that BR stores passwords in plain text means that they’re probably a very nice target for a quick hack (and if they’ve got bad practices in password storage, they probably have holes elsewhere as well). Unlike the Gawker password leak, which had hashed passwords (though they could still be eventually brute-forced), the BR passwords aren’t even obfuscated (or if they are, it’s in an easily reversible way).

Today, I’m happy to announce the launch of my newest app, Mapskrieg for iOS! I’ve been working on this app for a few weeks, and I think it’s ready for public consumption. It’s basically Mapskrieg, but developed natively for the iPhone and iPad. In the past, I’ve taken a sort of iterative approach of releasing fairly minimal apps and improving on them. For example, I released Threadless as an iPhone only app and later added the iPad support. I wanted to release Mapskrieg on both platforms so the launch would have a little more bang. Plus I think the iPad app is the better of the two, and I really wanted that one to stand out for the release. I’ve been getting much more comfortable with mobile development, and I’m very happy with the rate at which I was able to conceive and release ...",

      "content": "In the beginning of February this year there was some mild uproar about Google setting up an elaborate sting operation against Bing to prove that Bing was copying search results pages directly from Google using the Bing Toolbar. I personally thought it was a bit childish of Google to do this. All’s fair in gathering user-generated data, right? Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I put some code on Mapskrieg that would auto-detect a mobile device using the useragent string and show a mobile friendly site. I thought this was clever, but apparently Google thought it was cloaking. Oops! My bad. I took a hit on my Google search rankings. Once I fixed the issue my hits from Google have been coming back up slowly. I looked at Google Analytics to see how the organic search referrals had changed, and I noticed something interesting. Not only had the referrals from Google gone down, the ones from Yahoo and Bing did as well. Perhaps Yahoo and Bing noticed the “cloaking” behavior, too (Yahoo is ju...",

I got the itch, so I got to work figuring out what an app on the bigger screen would look like. I knew that I wanted a grid-y layout as opposed to the list-y one of the iPhone/iPod, which was partly the reason why I hadn’t done the iPad version yet. Lists on iOS are easy because they’re given to you for free. Grids are a whole other beast. Luckily, I ran into a framework (AQGridView) on GitHub that does grid layouts in a tableview-y sort of paradigm. The framework was still a little beta (or alpha) as I had to go in and change a few things that were crashing, but it did succeed in making my job a lot easier overall. I’d like to try contributing to that code to improve it, but I guess that’s another post altogether. After getting the grid stuff working, I de...",

This is pretty well documented on StackOverflow, etc. I thought this was why my splitviewblahblahblah wasn’t rotating. It turns out that, according to Apple’s documentation, A split view controller relies on its two view controllers to determine whether interface orientation changes should be made. If one or both of the view controllers do not support the new orientation, no change is made. This is true even in portrait mode, where the first view controller is not displayed. Therefore, you must override the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method for both view controllers and return YES for all supported orientations. The key here is that the view controller wasn’t autorotating because the s...",

Playing around with memcaching and stuff with Instascriber has led me to become a little obsessed with efficiency (not that I wasn’t already). I took a look at Mapskrieg and found that it was performing pretty slowly. My Google Webmaster Tools thing was saying it took on average 6-8 seconds to load! I wanted to decrease that number, and I figured I could make it work on App Engine, so I started working on it last week. I modified the parser I use to grab craigslist listings to also send them to Mapskrieg. Then I basically rewrote all of the logic that existed in PHP and ported it over to App Engine.

This means that AdMob shouldn’t take any income away from iAd, but only supplement it. I thought I’d take a look at the stats and compare the performance of the two ad networks on my app. (The following numbers I’m referring to are from the time period from 1/25 to 2/7) For an idea of scale, my app, Anime Nano, gets about 600 iAd requests per day. My app analytics software (Flurry) is saying I’m getting about 600 sessions per day. The thing is that about 1/5 of those sessions are on the iPad (and I haven’t enabled iAd on the iPad yet), so I think that on average, the iPhone apps are making a little more than one iAd request per session.

Previously, I read Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture, which also concerned pricing, but mostly in the super cheap range. Priceless takes more of a psychological stab at human behavior. There are a few experiments that both books alluded to, like the Hershey’s kiss experiment. Having read these two books (and the Freakonomics ones), I kind of think I should’ve been an economist.

Google seems to be taking a hybrid approach, which is pretty interesting. You get a notification the first time you arrive somewhere (probably only for places you’ve checked into before), and then an option to automatically check in after that. I might end up building some kind of hybrid (or a simple option in settings) system in Checkmate to see if that works better in general.

This happens when I try to add a widget to the home screen or open an app that hasn’t been opened into memory.

In March, I attended SXSW and moderated a panel that I had submitted the year before on Student Startups. I met many of my friends who I hadn’t seen in a while and met a lot of cool new people. It was from that experience that I decided I needed to stop doing what I was currently doing and change course so that I could do what I was “meant” to do.

I pointed out something that actually ended up being a bug that one of the dudes fixed almost immediately! Talk about transparency. At some point we were talking about how the Threadless t-shirt models are picked. Ivan (super nice guy) mentioned that the photographer might be looking for someone to model a shirt. He ended up replying and I got to model a brand new Threadless shirt in the cold, cold December Chicago air. The shirt’s called …To The Birds. Buy it today! The T...",

Apparently the feed parser I’m using is pretty inefficient because it’s eating up a lot of resources (relatively speaking) on App Engine. I remembered that the http protocol is pretty smart, and there’s a way to figure out if stuff has changed since the last time you grabbed it. Google’s urlfetch doesn’t seem to support conditional GETs (someone tell me if I am wrong). I looked around and found a few tutorials on how to accomplish this in Python using urllib2.

I wanted to contribute to the community by making an unofficial Threadless app (and maybe get a little store credit to feed my t-shirt needs). My main reasoning for writing a native Threadless app is that I found it pretty hard to browse shirts, even in a fully fledged web browser let alone an iPhone browser.

So I just ended up putting it on two lines, which is nice because then the other line is just my website address. I like the grainy look of the block ‘H’. Each one looks a little different, and at one point I mixed in some more blue to make it a darker green. It’s nice that the card itself is a slightly unique print. If I could redo this card, I’d probably try to pick a smaller font for the info. And I’d also choose different sizes for my...",

Developer ads are simple banner ads that entice a user to download an iPhone app. Here’s what the use case looks like via Business Insider: To Apple’s credit, the workflow is actually pretty good. It doesn’t require users to leave the app to download another one. Since developers can’t really afford the insane $2 cost per click that the big media customers pay, Apple is charging $.25 a click instead, and no cost per impression. Theoretically, this should mean that the fill rate would be very high (as long as developers are not maxing out on their daily spend limit or too aggressively filtering out apps). Yet I’ve noticed a pretty big fall in fill rate (from about 30% to 20%) in the last month. I think the main issue is that Apple never really intended iAd to be used fo...",

One reason they were excited was Yahoo’s revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.

Hear from a panel of young professionals who were in this same position and quit before they hit the one -year mark. They’ve since moved on to greener pastures and have found their true calling, or are at least a step closer. They are part of a larger movement who believe in an iterative career path. Disillusioned employees: share your pain and ask the panel how and why they made their decision to quit.

While the company hasn’t been operating for a while, I was using its iPhone developer account to mess around with submitting stuff to the app store. I wrote my Anime Nano app and it was pretty cool. I wanted to start getting into other kinds of apps, and I wanted to integrate iAd with Anime Nano. To do this, I needed to make my own iPhone dev account because I didn’t want to set up the taxes for a defunct company. I figured it would be a simple process to move an app from one owner to another, because it must happen all the time, right? I sent in a request to move Anime Nano from Troubadour’s account to my own personal dev account. That was around the beginning of July. I didn’t get a reply until the beginning of August, more than a month later. Unfortunately, between the time I requested the move, my comp...",

This was the third time I’ve seen her in concert, which is the most times I’ve seen anyone in concert, I think. Besides the band I was in myself, which doesn’t count. I had recently seen her and the band in Seattle in October last year. I was hoping there’d be a lot of new material, but for the most part it was a lot of songs from her latest two albums, Everybody and Be Okay/Girls and Boys. She played one new song called “Parachute” that was catchy. As usual, Ingrid and the band came off as genuinely having a good time. I think it helped that this was a fan show (they pre-sold out to the fan email list) and they had been opening for a band so no one knew who they were for the past few shows. As with any live show, the best parts are when the band does something unexpected. In this show, they mixed in the chorus from Poker Face into Soldier (I think they might’ve done that last time, too), did a ...",

You can buy the game for the same amount as an unauthorized guide, which has information freely that’s available online! The craziest one is the app called “The Angry Bird,” which has an angry looking bird trying to kill worms or something. I am assuming all of these apps are legal under fair use and whatnot (if they’re only stating facts), yet something tells me they could be violating trademark rules… I wonder if other popular apps have this same kind of thing happening to them.

That’s what Apple assumes, at least. The major takeaways from this article are that only a limited number of advertisers are signing on at first, and at a really high premium. What’s more, iAds are costly to “develop” which will limit the number of advertisers at first. Advertising relies on a steady supply of supply (advertising inventory) and demand (ad impressions). The advertisers supply the… well, supply, and the developers handle the demand by providing users who will see the ads. Because there’s not much supply yet, and because I have a feeling many developers will integrate iAds into their apps or already have, I predict a few things happening: Users will go through a high degree of ad fatigue. With only a few different ads a...",

I looked in the preferences for downloads, and noticed that I was connected to their Chicago datacenter. I tried switching it to Detroit and I still got some lame speeds. Then I switched to Phoenix, Arizona. And voila: My hypothesis was that the datacenters were dying from the load of the Steam summer sale. So I tried picking a datacenter in a less sparsely populated area (Phoenix probably isn’t serving that much load compared to Chicago or New York), even though it was further away. I think my hypothesis stands. So if you’re experiencing slow downloads, try picking a datacenter that’s further away. Just wait until my download is finished first. 🙂",

Unfortunately the license expired before I read the whole thing, so I grabbed a copy from the Ann Arbor library and finished it up. The book is incredibly easy to read and also incredibly short. It clocks in at a deceptive 273 pages. In reality, there is probably more illustration and whitespace than actual text. It feels like 37signals took general ideas from their blog and distilled them into super short nuggets of information. I think that the ADD-like feel of the book both helps and hinders. It drives home the point that you don’t need a lot of words to explain something. You can just be simple, and it’ll work. Personally, I feel it’s too easy to blaze through the book and really fo...",

Basically it’s to make people happy through unbeatable customer service.

The point is that data that I create is my property. I would go as far as to say that the online interactions I have, like friends’ activity that I comment on and interact with, is also my property. For example, a friend’s status message that I reply to and that ends up being a long thread. Some services make gathering my data easy. Twitter has a dead simple API and so does Last.fm. I’ve been toying around with gathering location data from Twitter, embedded in photos I take on my phone, and other sources.

I think that was a low estimate… At this point I really wish I had done more preparation for the trip, like maybe getting some audiobooks loaded up or at least bringing a book to read. I kinda just showed up (my Mom might’ve caused us to be late; this happens in real life). During our trip I kept feeling kind of dreadful. Like, what if we don’t come back (it was the first ever tourist trip to Mars)? And what if our pilot bus driver guy gets killed?

Ken Robinson argues that many people who are bad or disinterested in what they do just haven’t figured out what they’re good/passionate about, or have given up on pursuing the things they “should” be doing. Once people find that special something, they find a positive feedback loop. They like doing it so they do it more, and they get better at it. They probably also get external positive feedback, etc. With this virtuous cycle, they can achieve super awesome things. That’s the book in a nutshell. And I really didn’t have to read the whole book to see all the many permutations of this idea over and over again.

From the time that I knew it was accepted, I sprung into action and got my panelists together. Ellen from Alight Learning, Ben from Olark (formerly Hab.la) and Rishi from Underground Printing. While I did my research beforehand (I was a student entrepreneur myself, to begin with), I felt the need to cram some preparation a few days before the panel, too. I guess I should have gotten everything ready before the conference started, but I also wanted to get proper feedback from my panelists. One way I prepared to moderate was by reading a few blog posts on the subject that were linked to from the Speaker FAQ. Most agree that one should not over-prepare the panelists.

I told her that I had intended to frame them as a set of three and she printed a red one and sent it to me for free. It was really good of her to do that. I think the reason I like Letterpress is that it leaves a very tangible impression. The object itself is a representation of something that’s not quite 2d, but not quite 3d either. In an age of all things digital, when it’s so easy to reproduce something by printing it out on an inkjet or laser printer, it’s nice to have something that’s a bit more difficult to recreate.

Some of us go bonkers finding good deals, even when it’s not really economical (driving miles to save a few cents on gas). I’ve displayed this behavior in the past, buying videogames when they’re on sale while never having enough time to even finish the ones I’ve started, let alone the new ones I bought. I’ve chilled out a little when it comes to randomly buying stuff, but the allure of a good deal is still strong. There are also some fun experiments described. Like the one where a person is presented with a crappy Hershey’s chocolate for 1 penny or an upgrade to a premium chocolate for 25 cents. Most people pick the premium.

His parents encouraged him to be studious but didn’t push in any particular direction. He had to learn how to fit into American society, but it seems he had a head start.

Whereas The Omnivore’s Dilemma was a narrative adventure, following the path of a few meals, In Defense of Food is more about the history of our attitudes about food. Pollan explores the policy changes that gave way to subsidized farming and “nutritionism,” a form of reductionist science to ultimately dictate what Americans should eat. In that sense, it’s a much simpler book. A lot of the lessons learned in Omnivore’s Dilemma are in this one as well. In Defense of Food seems to focus more on the effect of the “food” we’re...",

Much of the book is centered around how the telegraph came to exist. It describes the setup of optical telegraph systems where numerous towers were constructed to the laying of thousands of miles of electrical cable, some across the ocean. This part of the book was mostly a bore to me. While it’s nice to know that there was a long process to standardize codes and international regulations, etc, it just isn’t that salient to me.

HC Jr. is best when he’s singing jazz standards, or songs that have been creatively arranged as jazz standards, like his Christmas songs and his really cool album, “Songs I Heard,” which consists of a bunch of songs from kid’s movies. I really like Songs I Heard because it takes familiar songs and transforms them into something unique that Connick can work with. Your Songs pretty much seems like a cash-in album. Harry C basically loaded a bunch of popular songs into this album so that people would buy it. “Oh, it has ‘Can’t Help Falling in Love’ on it! It even has a Beatles song!” The problem with the album, and I’m not sure how the producers didn’t catch this very early in the process, is that the arrangements are so dull that Harry sounds li...",

I pity the fool who has to play Mr. T’s part while not actually being Mr. T. I bet he even has a last name with more than one character! My second concern is that people will get shot in this movie. In the TV show, no one ever got shot. They were shot at, but no bullets ever entered anyone. Actually, I think there may have been an episode where a person was shot, but I don’t think it was ever fatal. I hope that they at least make Mr. T (or the dude who’s playing him) afraid of flying. It looks like it from the scene in the plane in the trailer. It’s kind of hard to tell, but I bet he drank some drugged milk or something. Oh, and...",

Linked is the story of the birth of graph theory and how early network models evolved to how we understand them today. Barabasi does a really good job of inserting character and context into the early scientists that formed the early ideas about networks. For example, he introduces Euler with a story about how he gave his nephew some lessons and worked on calculations that would some day lead to the discovery of Neptune. Oh, and he died that day, never to see the fruits of his labor. This kind of narrative is what I found lacking in Connected, and the kind I also noticed in Six Degrees. Go Barabasi! That isn’t to say that Barabasi isn’t the king of all prose. One bugaboo I kept running into while reading linked was that Barabasi seems to have a certain idiosyncrasy in his writing. To be blunt, he starts too many sentences with the wor...",

Randy Pausch’s story is pretty interesting. He was a professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer – not the most survivable. His diagnosis gave him 3-6 months, and for his “Last Lecture” he showed people how to live their childhood dreams. The video really caught on! I watched it quite a while ago and it really is incredibly inspiring. You can see it here. The Last Lecture: The Book, goes into further detail on things that Pausch touched upon during the lecture. It’s a more thought-out version that makes sense as a book, since a four or five-hour lecture might be a bit rough on the audience. Randy’s mai...",

In Connected, Christakis and Fowler argue that social networks are a natural part of our lives. We’ve evolved to be good at navigating them and using them for our needs. While it’s simple to prove our actions have an effect on people who we are directly connected to, we apparently also have an effect on the people who are connected to the people we are connected to. This effect fans out from us to our third degree contacts (friends of friends of friends). Our actions might affect others’ obesity, happiness, loneliness and promiscuousness. Conversely, people we don’t even know can affect whether we’re happy or fat (not mutually exclusive). I actually saw James Fowler talk about some resear...",

I think one was of Dick and Jane. I felt the kind of nostalgia that you get going to a place you used to frequent as a kid but rarely as an adult. Think back to elementary school when they’d send you to the same place every year or semester. Like the natural history museum for me. The museum quickly got boring so my dream transitioned me to shopping at a grocery store. I think it was Meijer. Shopping got boring in the dream (which strangely never happens in real life) and I resorted to riding my shopping cart around with another dude who kinda seemed like my friend Matt Strand.

Or how it slows down a bit when it knows it’s gonna hit the wall. And it hits the wall a lot. It also plays a sort of sad sound when it runs out of batteries. The Roomba definitely has a personality. In addition to just being a cool nerdy object, the Roomba does a pretty decent job. It picked up a bunch of gunk the first time it swept through my apartment. It seemed to prefer the living room, maybe because it was dirtiest? Or maybe because it liked the feel of the shag rug. I’m not sure. The algorithm that determ...",

I still liked the story, but I had quite a different perspective this time. I first read the book when I was around 11-12. The same age as the protagonist when he’s at the top of his game. I must’ve read the book more for the action and less for the things happening behind the scenes.

One of the first things I noticed was that the female trainer (which I usually use) is showing a bit more skin! Take a look at some comparison shots: Before: After: I also like her new hairsyle. I wonder. If Wii Fit Plus means that the female trainer shows some more skin, will Wii Fit Plus Plus have the female trainer go topless? I guess we have to wait to find out. One new feature that I was excited about was the ability to set up your own routines. So instead of picking each activity one by one, you can save a bunch and just go through them quickly without interruption.

After two years of success, it seems like she’s a lot more confident, but also kind of diva-ish. Not that she’s a bitch or anything, but she’s sort of less charming in the way she was before. She still mentioned lots of random stuff like crying a bunch after watching The Family Stone on the tour bus and how much they like all like Mexican food.

Here’s the proposal: Description: While student startups are not a new phenomenon, universities and venture capitalists are beginning to see the advantages in supporting them. Join a panel of student entrepreneurs in a discussion on finding funding, incorporating a company and balancing homework, work and life, all while attending school full-time. Questions answered during the panel: How are universities starting to support student entreprenurship? What are the legal implications of using university resources for personal business?

For example, they rejected the Google Voice app using their generic “duplicates iPhone features” reasoning. Isn’t that kind of reasoning grounds for an antitrust case? They also rejected a dictionary app for potentially bad words! Someone think of the children! While I think Apple deserves some credit for popularizing the whole app store notion, they also kind of suck for holding such an iron grip on it. It’s nice to find apps in the store without having a third party directory or searching for apps all over the mobile web. But it sucks when honest developers get screwed because of totalitarian control. I wonder if there can’t be a nice, happy medium. Maybe an app store combined with a way to legally (without jailbreaking) install apps via a third party. For now, the iPhone’s App Store is great for customers, but I have a feeling that abused developers ...",

I recently got bored and decided to fix up my PC and put Win 7 RC on it (I think the thing flipped out when I got a new hard drive and it somehow got two Win XPs into the boot registry thing). I already tried installing Win 7 Beta on my Macbook Pro a few times via Boot Camp and VMWare Fusion. They were both pretty bad solutions. It’s just too much to try and virtualize a modern operating system, and the Boot Camp drivers are just kinda crappy. My main thing was that Win 7 kept crashing in Boot Camp, losing wireless connections and having a really laggy touchpad interface. You may recall that my opinions of Vista were not the most positive. About a year and a half (and an operating system) later, I think the thing is finally pretty good. The user experience is nice. I like the fact t...",

While it took some time for me to read through all 411 pages, it was a really enjoyable experience. From my library account page, I can see I renewed the book 5 times! The Omnivore’s Dilemma basically states that there is something really wrong with the way that America is eating. This is probably already very apparent by the amount of obesity, diabetes and eating disorders that we all hear about on the news. But besides the insane portion sizes and amounts of sugar, there’s also something horribly strange about the way our food is produced. Pollan takes a journalistic approach to get to the bottom of the issue, following the trail of corn to his McDonald’s meal, the life of his CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation) steer, a meal cooked on a “sustainable” farm and his own “perfect meal” that was created solely by himself via foraging and hunting. As a vegetarian, I’ve always been...",

By “a free song,” they really mean $1.29 of credit, since some songs cost that much, but others actually cost less. Because of this added value of this flavor (the other ones don’t have free songs), I’ve been kind of loading up on Sync. This also leads me to a semi-interesting economics problem.

I guess that counts as enjoying history as well… Emily, Katie and I set up an appointment at SegTours of Gettysburg for a “Segway Experience.” This did not include an actual tour.

Basic training consists of Segwaying around in a parking lot until you get the hang of it. There are also cones involved. I got going pretty quickly.

Blink tells the story of our subconscious (Gladwell uses “unconscious” which kinda bugs me) brain’s ability to make split-second decisions. Basically, he argues that we’ve evolved to “thin-slice” certain experiences (recognizing when a fake statue just doesn’t look right or hearing a singer who turns out to be a natural). That ability can be used in other contexts if we could just determine the important variables and block out everything else. Gladwell is a really good writer; his stories are interesting and they flow well. Unfortunately, the actual substance feels like it lacks the scientific rigor that I’m used to. For example, he has a chapter on the aforementioned thin-slicing – only taking in th...",

It seems like all it does is pick random songs out of the library and shows them in the order they’ll be played (unlike shuffle, which just randomly jumps around). Typically, I like to put my iTunes library on random when I’m listening. This allows me to hear a bunch of different music in my library. If I don’t like a certain song, I’ll skip it, unless I’m not really paying attention. I find that the most important piece of metadata in my iTunes library is probably “play count.” This is a pretty good indicator of how much I like a song. It’s a bit off sometimes though, since I might really like a new song with a lower play count because I haven’t had a chance to listen to it 80 times. I use a smart playlist that sorts on “play count” to determine which songs to stick into my iPhone on sync since the phone can’t hold my entire music library. Generally it works well. Perhaps there could be another measure like “normalized ...",

People were talking about the mouse-over video search results starting automagically. I thought I saw that feature at the Microsoft booth at SXSW a few months ago. While I’m not totally familiar with the original features of Live Search, it really seems like this is just an incremental update, if not just a renaming.

Depending on your perspective, or “mindset” on life, you can really affect your own learning and personal growth. Basically, people with a “fixed” mindset believe that a person’s qualities are predetermined and set in stone. So people who are good at math won’t fail and those who are bad at math will never be good at it. Conversely, people with a “growth” mindset will understand that with practice and reflection, people can improve in just about any measurable quality. They see f...",

Leah Price spoke about book fetishism. How, as the book is considered less and less the de facto vehicle by which its contents are delivered, it becomes more of a fetishized object than just a “book.” In other words, there are computer screens, Kindles, audio books and other ways for us to digest fiction and non-fiction works. Because of this, books become special objects. The act of reading a book instead of a screen or anything else becomes something special and deliberate. I tend to agree a lot. Just as part of me enjoys wearing glasses because many people do not, and the act of wearing glasses sort of differentiates me from other people, so does reading a physical book.

Then there was a string quartet called ENRON or something (err, it was ETHEL) included in the instrumentation. This made the music seem a bit more fancy, but also more… orchestrated.

The strings can’t really improvise along with the rest of the band (at least not in 4 part harmony) so everything is a little more rigid.

I noticed that they kept playing in weird time signatures (7, then 5, then 3, which is not totally weird but less common).

That may be true, but there’s also this thing called “value.” Apple computers have always been about quality. Software quality, build quality, design.

I don’t need people finding my (private) Facebook profile anyway. 4 is my Twitter profile. 5 is a LinkedIn profile of a Hung Truong that isn’t me either. 6 is a link to a person wiki of some kind called “AboutUs.” It’s basically an auto-generated wiki about my portfolio. I’ll count this as one in my favor. 7 is a news story about the Hung Truong that killed a police officer! Hopefully...",

      "content": "So I keep hearing about this mythical “Earth Hour” in which we’re supposed to turn our lights off an hour earlier than usual. My first thought was that it was sad that Earth Day was downsized to last just an hour. My second thought was that, while the activity is a nice gesture of wanting to help the environment, it probably does little to actually affect anything in the long term. I’m no electrical engineer, but the way I understand it, power plants adjust their output according to power usage. So they use less fuel at night and more during the peak hours of the day. Turning your lights off for an hour will probably just make the power plants less effective unless they anticipate or quickly adjust to the lower amounts of power being drawn. It’s sorta like how having a one-day gas boycott doesn’t really do anything. Earth Hour seems like a sad indicator of how lazy we are as humans. It’s like a band-aid. “If I turn my lights off for an hour, I’m saving the planet!” You could also ju...",

Anyway, it seems as though I’m the only person who ever wrote a blog about applying to grad schools. Because a lot of people who meet me at visiting days tell me they’ve read my blog. This is kind of weird and kind of flattering as it means my page rank for certain queries is high, and also that these people know stuff about me before even meeting me.

Apparently, the customized search results are the “carrot” on the stick for content producers to markup their content semantically. The Yahoos noted that the customized results provide better click-through rate. While that’s a nice way to think about incentivizing the semantic web, I see a few flaws. First off, the increased click-throughs are probably due to the pretty graphics and stuff. What happens when everyone has customized search results? The search results page gets cluttered and looks like crap. Furthermore, an increase of click-through in a search engine that has 20% of the search engine market (says ...",

To me, Twitter is simply a subset of what Facebook already provides. Why would you ever need both? This historical post is both illuminating and funny for a number of reasons. Apparently in the past I hardly updated my Facebook status at all. These days I probably do so at least once a day, and usually multiple times a day.

The only one whose name I remember is Criss Cross. The second half, they played songs out of the Blue Note label. When Wynton announced that they were gonna play “Blues Walk,” I expected a pretty uptempo major straightahead bebop blues. But apparently there is a difference between Blues Walk and The Blues Walk. Wynton is pretty good at telling random stories. Like he talked about Lee Morgan and his funny-named albums: “Delightfulee,” “Cornbread,” “The Rumproller.” One of the band members mentioned “The Gigolo” and then Wynton Marsalis made a quip about how that’s why Lee Morgan isn’t here with us today (he was cheating on his girlfriend and s...",

Their first song was about how they’re the opening band, and no one paid to hear them and we hope that they leave soon so Jonathan Coulton could get on stage. At least they have a good sense of humor about it! Their songs were pretty interesting for the most part. They had a way of choreographing things (Paul was always doing something with his hands) that kept it interesting and their harmonies were pretty sweet. They also gave out random prizes like an uncomfortably small Batman mask and monkey keychain that lit up and made monkey noises. Before the show, Jonathan Coulton asked for requests fr...",

I was dreaming that I was half-asleep. Maybe I really was half-asleep and just hallucinating. I’m not entirely sure. Anyway, I dreamed that I was sleeping in my parent’s bed. In-between both of them. Kinda funny huh? That’s not what made it bad. I also dreamed there was something flying around the room. It was kind of hard to tell what, but I sensed it was leathery. Like, say, a bat. Then, as I realized the flying object really was a bat, it decided to fly onto my neck and bite it! You know how in dreams you sort of do things in slow-motion? So sometimes you know something is inevitable, but you still try to stop it anyway? This was how the bite felt. As the bat bit me (I swear I felt pain), I woke up like in the movies where someone wakes up from a bad dream. I literally checked my neck to see if a bat was biting me. And ...",

We went to a place called “Baker’s Keyboard Lounge,” which is apparently the oldest jazz club, ever. That night, a group played which I would describe as a “mixed bag.” The rhythm section was outstanding, but the sax player was okay and the trumpet player (who was, sadly, also the bandleader) was in serious need of some lessons in improvisation. Most of the people I went with weren’t Jazz connoisseurs. I sort of think of myself as an intermediate one since I’ve been involved with Jazz (playing and listening) since middle school. Anyway, I promised I’d make a Jazz primer for those interested, and I kind of let it get onto the backburner for a while. I could’ve just grabbed some tracks but I wanted to comment on what to listen to or what I liked about each track so it would be more accessible (Jazz is hard to get into if you don’t know what to look for).

There’s 11 tracks but three are live, and there’s some duplication (live vs. studio, and acoustic). So I’d say there’s more than a single’s worth of stuff but not quite an album’s worth. Ingrid continues to do cool stuff with her awesome voice and funky phrasing. It’s pretty unique. Her actual songwriting seems a bit amateurish or at least good but not super great. I guess her style is lots of repetition, which doesn’t work when applied to every song. It’s like the “Green Eggs and Ham” of music. But that’s her style so that’s cool I guess. I also noticed that her style seems to be using more vibrato and running around with her voice. I’m not too impressed by it. It’s especially noticeable on “Over The Rainbow.” She can do cooler stuff with her voice than that, I think. Finally, I’m kind of disappointed that she’s not weari...",

I know the original 151 and some of the ones after that, and I have Pokemon Diamond (or is it Pearl), but seriously, there’s too many for me to remember. My niece and nephew both have their own favorites. One likes the scary legendary ones (I told him they look scary and he disagreed), Palkia, Dialga and some other ones. And the other likes Togetic, the evolution of Togepi. Yes, I remembered that! Is it strange to have this much common ground with 8 and 6 year-olds?

First off, when I talked to a recruiter from Yahoo at Michigan, I was told that as a “green” measure, Yahoo wasn’t taking paper resumes. Okay, that’s pretty cool, I guess. Power to the Purple.

The “winners” of the process will win nothing (except “good karma” as Google explains) and the job of making the ideas into reality will go to some organization chosen through an RFP process.

Sure, a company like Microsoft or Yahoo will have their own research labs (this paper from Yahoo Research about the evolution of social networks is totally awesome), but smaller companies will most likely lack the resources and skills to do interesting network analysis.

Seasons change, electricity goes out and people get cold when it snows. The difference is that new visitors to the afterlife have a week to choose their most precious (大切な!) memory to immortalize in film form.

      "content": "So I’ve been playing Wii Fit for a while. One of the really neat things about the program (it’s not really a game, right?) is that it automagically graphs your progress as you lose weight. It’s pretty nice getting positive feedback when you put hard work into something. I think this is one of the very well thought-out features of Wii Fit. Anyway, I was looking at my weight going down and figured I’d do some rudimentary linear regression on it. I’m pretty much just eyeballing it because I don’t want to throw stuff into R or Matlab. It seems as though I’ll reach a threshold (away from Obesity) around the end of August. Though I’m basing this on a linear fit. It’s possible that the actual plot will end up looking more like a power law since it’s easier to lose weight when you’re way overweight. The point is, I’m losing weight and it’s nice to try and see when I might reach my goals. I also think it’s worth noting that Wii Fit seems to overestimate my weight. Because when I use my bathr...",

Geez, Bubble Man was so awesome! It’s amazing that Capcom is actually making a new Mega Man game with NES style graphics. I think the only reason this is possible is that digital distribution (Wii Shop channel, PS3 Store, Xbox Live) makes it extremely cheap to distribute. I imagine an 8-bit game costs less to develop than, say, Grand Theft Auto 4. So Capcom should be able to make its money back through nostalgic fans. I, for one, will probably be getting it. Depending on my level of nostalgia vs. the price of the thing. I remember the NES Mega Man series kind of jumping the shark anyway, when they started running out of “Men” to use. ...",

Also, my normal trainer will just say random stuff sometimes, like she’ll act sleepy and talk about how she didn’t get enough sleep last night. Hey trainer, let’s try to keep it professional, huh? I don’t want to know about your personal life. Another random thing I noticed was that my playing time would just randomly reset sometimes. I finally figured out what was going on last night. It turns out that Wii Fit just counts the minutes you work out per day. So since I was playing late last night, the time reset. I think it would make more sense to count minutes on a per session basis, but whatever. The whole midnight cutoff thing works too, I guess. Finally, I noticed that my trainer’s hairstyle changed...",

I’m technically specializing in “Social Computing,” which includes the study of stuff like complex systems, graph theory, sociology, etc. Since it’s a relatively new (or recently popular) field, there’s a lot of overlap with other fields. And as described in the book, it is very interdisciplinary. Much of the book covers things I studied in SI 508: Networks. But in the sense that Six Degrees is more of a historical recollection than a textbook, there was quite a lot to take in.

Started moving some of my websites to a new server. Currently trying to figure out how to run rails using Mongrel. Currently fighting off an ant infestation. Etc. So, yeah. If I have time maybe I’ll write some more about these things. Anyone have a preference to what they want to read about? EDIT: I also just realized that I also: Am growing a beard.

Or rather, it doesn’t reach the potential that it obviously has. There are so many untied loose ends that at the end of the movie, I was really sure there had to be more. What about the skinny guy’s relationship with the fat woman? What about the skinny guy’s love of science, and not God? Wasn’t Nacho supposed to convert him or something?

Previous comparisons have been throwing out things like “what does an orange taste like?” or “what is the capital of New Zealand?” No one asks those kinds of questions. Therefore, I will just search “who is Hung Truong?” since I’m sure lots of people want to know. It’s probably the most popular search term of all time, really. The Google search does pretty well. 6/10 links on the first page are actually attributable to me, Hung Truong (the most popular Hung Truong on Google today!).

If you recall, I wrote a blog post a few months ago about the viral vs. non-viral growth of Facebook applications that I had developed. One of those apps, Musical Instruments, lets you list which musical instruments you play. It’s kind of fun because some people play really whacked-out instruments (I play pianica and soprano trombone). I think playing instruments is typically a pretty social experience, which sort of led me to think about comparing the “sociability” of certain instruments to each other with the data gathered from this app. Users input their instruments via an autocompleting text field. If an instrument already exists in the database (and at least 3 or so users have claimed it), it will autocomplete. In the above scre...",

Why so expensive!? I’m not an electrical engineer (or computer engineer even), but it doesn’t make sense that the hardware can cost so much. Couldn’t you just rig something up that just physically “switches” the wiring? Maybe the switch requires some power, but I can’t imagine the logic being that terribly complex. In comparison, a lot of the VGA KVM switches I’ve looked at cost maybe $25. What’s the difference, besides a few extra signals being re-routed? So my short term cheapo fix will...",

Also, the cartoony quality of the graphics led to some weird cognitive dissonance as I led my cute dudes with their tanks off to die in gruesome battle. Days of Ruin sort of fixes this by making the graphics more gritty and changing the setting to a post-apocalyptic world. So everyone is fighting for food and survival instead of just for the hell of it. Unfortunately, the setting is not like Mad Max, where everyone is hoarding hockey pads and crossbows and gas.

During my days at UNM, this was pretty common since the busses took a circular route, and so it would make sense for a bus driver to say hi versus ignoring his/her co-worker. It was even pretty common for drivers to open up their windows, stop the bus, and start a little chat. This was kind of annoying since I was usually late for class. I think the camaraderie doesn’t end by just affiliating with the same university. I was riding the blue Michigan bus to work the other day and I noticed a cross-bus encounter! The school bus driver was talking to the city bus driver across busses! So this must be a really strong link between bus drivers of all types, regardless of employer or bus model. Is there some kind of strange connection being made between these bus drivers? Is bus driving sch...",

What’s a little strange is that there doesn’t seem to be any growth going on in Facebook. Maybe they’ve normalized the data so you can spot trends, but you’d kind of assume that word counts would trend towards going up since Facebook is still supposedly growing. Or is Lexicon telling us something Facebook doesn’t want us to know about their growth? Anyway, at least one question of the ages has been put to rest.

It was working pretty well last night but for some reason the thing is choking in Firefox for me right now (and making Safari crash AND making IE run out of memory), yay for compatibility testing! Anyway, the site is neat because if you’re as old as I am, you might remember making mix tapes for your friends. There was an art to this. Instead of the crazy-huge capacities of an MP3 player that you have these days, tapes were limited to like, 90 minutes or something.

In December, another tech blogger, Marc Orchant, died at 50 of a massive coronary. A third, Om Malik, 41, survived a heart attack in December. Other bloggers complain of weight loss or gain, sleep disorders, exhaustion and other maladies born of the nonstop strain of producing for a news and information cycle that is as always-on as the Internet. I heard about Om Malik, but I didn’t know two other blogger dudes died of heart attacks. I guess I can imagine how this happens though. When I was starting my Anime Blog I wanted it to be successful, so I did spend quite a bit of time thinking about how to get to that point. After a while though, I just figured that blogging should be for fun, not dollars (even though my blogs a...",

I had met their VP of Engineering, Dug Song at a career fair and ended up giving him my business card. I got an email from Zattoo about them being interested in an interview. I’m not looking for an internship anymore, but I figured I’d have a chat to get to know the company better in case I want to work there after I graduate. I talked to two engineers. I can’t really remember their names now! Oops. But basically we talked about the technologies behind the service (it’s a real-time streaming tv service). It’s kind of interesting that they use P2P in order to distribute the live tv content. I thought this might end up with a pretty big delay in actually getting the content, but one of the guys said there was only a difference of ~20 seconds or so. One of the things that their website job page lists is that they want people with an interest in social networks. While I thought this was interesting and ...",

I’ve made it a point to export all my old blog entries though, so I was kind of pissed to see that 2003 was nowhere to be found. Sure enough, I checked out my old livejournal (which still exists!) and exported all the posts from 2003 into my blog this afternoon.

The growth of Notecentric isn’t what I had hoped it would be. Not too many people use it, probably due to network effects of Facebook promoting a competing app (note to Facebook: if you want to promote a level playing field, don’t play favorites!) and other general performance issues (the application is pretty barebones and the RFacebook library I used to write it is pretty damn slow. It times out a lot!). Anyway, I got some neat network data from it, which made the whole thing worthwhile. You can check out the original paper I wrote last semester here.

You can use its built-in APIs to set user location information and grab user information from it (assuming you have the correct permissions). This is cool because in the past, applications have had to do this location stuff on their own. For example, if I wanted to set up a Twitter clone that knew a user’s location, I’d have to be able to take the information and process it, and retrieve it later. Fire Eagle handles a lot of stuff like figuring out exactly where a user when things might be ambiguous (I typed in “University of Michigan” and it gave me a choice between the main campus and the Dearborn one). I’m planning on coding up some location aware applications at some point soon, so I think it’ll be fun to try and see what I can...",

Both companies I “interviewed” with (I got some short informational interviews) were looking for PM types. The PM here is either product or project management. I think they’re pretty similar and the actual job really depends on the context of which company it’s at. I think the PM stuff differs quite a bit from standard software engineering in that you’re expected to think about the product as a whole rather than the implementation details alone. So that involves stuff like considering the design, the user, how decisions affect both, and tradeoffs that each solution results in. It’s pretty interesting stuff that requires a lot of thought.

My opinion on suits is that I hope I’ll never work anywhere that requires one, except for maybe at a company formal party or something. I guess it’s pretty standard attire for an internship fair, but I think distinguishing yourself is important too. Everyone looks the same in a suit. Luckily, I distinguished myself as the idiot who didn’t bring a suit. Mostly I just wandered around looking all the companies. Quite a few had really long lines just to talk to a recruiter. The place was packed, too. There were probably a few hundred people in any given room. I talked to some people from Liberty Mutual. The guy was laid back and pretty cool. He told me to check their website for any openings, and I got a pen and a weird bendy thing (it’s like, a blue bendy stick). I also checked out this local web development company called Enlighten.

If you’re wondering what a pianica is, it’s like a melodica, except when Yamaha makes it they call it a pianica.

It’s “famous” for being in that manga, Nodame Cantabile, which I totally like, which is mostly why I bought it. I practiced a bit today, but I really suck at keyboard.

Wynton and the gang are already criticized enough for playing “era” music, so it’s weird that they limited themselves even further. The sounds were definitely authentic-sounding, but it’s funny because whenever someone takes a solo, you can hear them sort of drift into the future (or our present) and play licks that would have been unheard of (well, at least unheard) in Duke’s band. I mean, what’s the point of sounding so accurate and then playing a solo that’s got hard bop licks? Overall though, it was pretty sweet. And they played C Jam Blues as an encore.

Unless you’re a weakling, the benefit of having a slightly lighter computer isn’t really worth all that you’re losing. Sure, there’s stuff like the multi-touch and um… isn’t that about it? I was totally ready to buy whatever new awesomeness Apple had ready for the Macbook Pro, but I guess I’ll forgo buying one until they do get an upgrade.

Of course, afterwards I fully disclosed this information. I’d never be able to live up to the hype if someone challenged me to a live game anyway. I mostly cheated to see if my program was any good.

So far, I’ve had pretty much all brands of orange juice available. There’s Minute Maid, Tropicana, Simply Orange, Meijer brand… In short, I’ve become somewhat of an orange juice connoisseur.

It’s a pretty simple point and click game where you’ve happened upon a strange mansion and spooky things pop up everywhere. It’s actually kind of scary, especially the part where the ghost that looks like Scarlet o’ Hara rips you to shreds if you talk to her. My dream was that I was sort of in this world.

So I tried using Hpricot tonight. Apparently it’s super fast, but the documentation assumes you know a whole lot about the mating habits (internal workings) of HTML and XML. And… I don’t really. At least, not until I found this handy XPath tutorial! After actually reading the tutorial, rather than trying to wing/hack it again, I think I have a pretty good feel for this Hpricot thing. Basically, there’s a pretty simple vocabulary for describing the nested nature of XML. It’s impossible to figure out from the Hpricot tutorials (which I tried doing for a while), but insanely simple once you just look at the tutorial. Ah well, I guess that’ll teach me a lesson not to hack so much when it’s easier to RTFM…",

Almost every article on the Gawker blogs will have links to “Posts tagged as” whatever, which links to a tag list. I noticed on the actual sites that they change the color of internal link to blend in, and the external links look like links. That’s good, except that I read the blogs in Google Reader. So an article ends up looking like this: Holy Crap! 8 of the 12 links on that page are directed to a fucking tag list! First of all, this is incredibly annoying. If a person clicks on a link entitled “Facebook” then maybe clicking on it should take them to FACEBOOK!!! Second, linking to internal “search results” for SEO purposes is frowned upon by Google. Of course, they’re not just doing this for the SEO, but also for crazy-insane inf...",

We give people One Number…for Life – a number that’s not tied to a phone or a location – but tied to you. With GrandCentral, you can be reached with a single number, answer a call at any phone you want, seamlessly switch phones in the middle of a call, and even know whether a call is important before you take it. This idea is good in theory. My family’s had the same home phone number for like, 20+ years, and if we ever changed that number, a lot of people would instantly lose contact with us, since it’s the only thing point of contact they have. I signed up and chose a number in the 505 area code (they give you a bunch of choices and you pick one). I c...",

Anyway, I subscribed to the TMBG Podcast since it’s free, and they occasionally play some rare stuff from their old glory days.

The songs are: Dirt Bike, No One Knows My Plan, I Should Be Allowed To Think, No One Knows My Plan, Out of Jail, Lullaby of Nightmares (which I think appeared on Long Tall Weekend), and A Self Called Nowhere. Unfortunately, nowhere does End of the Tour or Destination Moon show up. I guess they can’t put the whole album up… The first real TMBG album I ever heard was John Henry.

The typing is alright, but when you type words that are uncommon in the dictionary, for instance, “truong,” the keyboard kinda compensates in the wrong direction. Besides that, the applications are pretty fun to use, but they seem a bit more jerky than the commercials would have you believe. For instance, I was using the google maps app and it took forever to download the map tiles! The zooming in and out using the multi touch was way cool, but it also seemed to lag behind a bit as well. I know it’ll take lag to move stuff around, but it was… how should I put it? Slower than I expected. The iPhone certainly is a cool gadget. I just don’t know why it needs to be a phone. Apple’s created a pretty sweet PDA that includes a phone, which requires a subscription fee. If they had just c...",

It’s the risk that one takes when developing using an API, though. I guess I should’ve read the terms more closely. It’s completely within Amazon’s rights to request that I change them app’s name.

Funny sidenote: when I went to Google for an interview, Peter Norvig was the special speaker dude. He had a pretty cool Hawaiian shirt on then too, as I recall. Anyway, the talk brings up some pretty interesting things, like how if you feed enough statistics to a computer, the actual algorithm matters less and less.

I really liked it, though I never actually “plan” my TV watching, so I hardly ever see it. I just bought the DVDs so I could see the first two seasons. I think I saw like, 2 or 3 episodes from this past season. One thing I’ve noticed about House is that patients going into seizures usually mean a commercial break. I guess it’s just good TV writing to have a seizure plus fade to black… Also, the doctors really love Diazepam, which goes along with the many seizures. I remember Diazepam from Metal Gear Solid, which would help you relax to use the sniper rifle.

One of these locations is in Silicon Valley, so I figured I’d check out Google Headquarters (it’s a lot easier than stalking them in person). I remembered from my visit that the Googleplex was on Ampitheatre Parkway, so I just went there and looked at the street view. While circling the Googleplex (in a non-threatening manner), I found an easter egg! There’s a bunch of googlers in green shirts, with one riding a motorcycle! Neat! I’m guessing they were on the team that did the mapping or had something to do with the street level feature. By the way, the street level views are freaking sweet!!! There’s incredible detail (you can zoom in) and every few feet there’s a 3d panorama to view. Incredible. If they could get this for every city, I really think sightseeing in person would become obsolete. PS, I still want to work at Google very, very badly.",

I just installed Orb on my computer. Basically, Orb connects with a central server. From a website, you can log in and “request” the media that’s sitting on your home computer. When you “request” something, the local program will start encoding the media at a decent bitrate and stream it to you over the web. It’s pretty cool, actually.

Apparently Facebook’s API will let you find all of the current user’s friends, but it won’t let you see all of the friends of any other user. This seriously limits the capabilities of the API by a whole lot. This sort of makes sense. If the API let you see more than a logged in user could, that user could theoretically get past privacy setting that are in place. However, the API just blocks all queries that try to find all friends of anyone other than yourself. When logged in, you can see this info, so I don’t see the harm in offering it in the API.

After doing some CSS to overlay some divs over the Google Map, I found out there’s another way to do this: with “custom controls.” The way that the custom controls work is both pretty sweet, and not that great.

CakePHP tries to follow the conventions of Rails, but it does so in a sort of copycat manner. As such, the result does not meet or exceed the original. In the case of Helpers, Rails automagically links the named helper to the controller. In CakePHP, you must specify that a certain controller uses a certain helper. It’s kind of annoying.

Super Paper Mario is different from the other Paper Mario games in a big way. The RPG elements have been pretty much removed. Now, instead of taking turns attacking and defending, Mario just attacks the enemies in real time. So it’s more like the original Super Mario, except with hit points and stats. I’m not too happy with this, since I liked the RPGness of Paper Mario. I thought Paper Mario was just an extension of the old Super Mario RPG games. Now that they’ve got rid of the RPG, it’s just not as fun. The graphics are pretty neat though. There’s this thing where you flip from 2D mode to 3D mode. It’s like going from a flat world to three dimensions. You can find hidden stuff and avoid the 2D enemies in 3D mode. The humor is still intact, too.

Google had me sign a pretty hefty NDA (Non-disclosure agreement) so I’ll try to be careful with what I say. Basically, I believe that if what I say is pretty much common net knowledge, I’ll be ok. I don’t really think they told me any Google secrets.

I missed the registration and about half of the introduction talk. I sat down at a table whose occupants were librarians. Pretty much everyone there was an LIS (library and information services) specialist. This wasn’t really a great first impression, since I applied under the HCI (human-computer interaction) specialization, and to be honest, libraries aren’t really my thing.

Or vice versa, the mat could act as some kind of barrier, with people seeing “Go away” as they’re about to enter, and “Come in” when they’re ready to leave. Theoretically, no one would enter or leave the house, which would create a state of home equilibrium, perhaps.

The Shooting Range game is not Duck Hunt, which makes me sad. Basically you just shoot stuff. Sometimes the Duck Hunt ducks will fly by and you can shoot them, but otherwise you just hit targets. Find Mii is lame, unless you enjoy finding people in crowds. Table Tennis is really weak, because you can only control the horizontal action of the paddle. Tennis in Wii Sports is about 100 times better, and it comes with the Wii when you buy it! Pose Mii is also pretty boring. Laser Hockey is actually very fun.

I figured it’d be a good exercise to redo that simple site in a php template of sorts. So I used this pre-existing templating class and modified it for my needs.

LocoRoco is one of those weird Japanese games that become famous due to their weirdness. In LocoRoco, you roll a yellow ball animal thing by tilting the world left or right. You can also bump the world so the ball can jump. When the ball eats red flowers, it can grow. You can also blow up the big ball into smaller balls, and reform the big ball later on. Basically, the idea is to get the ball as large as possible and to make it to the end of the stage. You can get attacked by black spiky things that will reduce your size. At the end of the stage, you see how well you did getting larger, and collecting other random stuff. And that’s how the whole game goes. There’s not much else. If you’ve played one stage, you’ve sorta played them all. I got through the first world. One plus is that the game is super cute. ...",

I’ve already read about the 10 coins somewhere else online. It’s not really interesting to have the answer given to you. Since I’m a nerdy computer scientist, I was trying to come up with an algorithm to produce this set of coins. I came up with an iterative solution that goes like this: Start out with no coins. From 1 to 99 cents: If you can make exact change for the current amount, go to the next amount. Otherwise, try adding the largest denomination coin to your set of coins (a quarter) that will allow you to pay the exact amount. If it’s too big, go to the next smallest until you hit a penny.

There are note “tubes” that show up indicating whether you’re singing too low or high. It’s not quite like reading music or anything, but I guess it’s pretty good for public use. I really like the idea of playing a game with only your voice. It’s a pretty interesting idea and I’m kind of mad that I waited so long to finally buy a Karaoke Revolution game. I sort of secretly wanted to buy it ever since seeing these guys playing it. The gameplay isn’t perfect, though.

During Christmas time, I got the aforementioned Karaoke Revolution game. My sister did pretty well singing it; I’m a little too young to remember the actual show. I did try it later on though. It’s pretty darn catchy and soulful. Which means I’m pretty bad at singing it. I guess I just need some practice. Here’s the lyrics in case you found this page searching for them: Baby look at me And tell me what you see You ain’t seen the best of me yet Give me time I’ll make you forget the rest I got more in me And you can set it free I can catch the moon in my hands Don’t you know who I am? Remember my name (Chorus) Fame I’m gonna live forever I’m gonna learn how to fly High I feel it coming together People will see me and cry Fame I’m gonna make it to heaven Light up the sky like a flame Fame I’m gonna live forever Baby remember my name...",

I won’t disclose the questions I was asked, not because they asked me to, but because I think it would undermine the effectiveness of the interview process itself. Plus I have a feeling that Google “Googles” to find questions posted online and doesn’t use them anyway. I had a chance to describe a project that I had worked on. I chose Notecentric, since it was more complex than Anime Nano and I could say that I worked on the entire thing by myself. I did a pretty simple (and nervous) high level overview of the system and my reasons for creating it. The first question I got was a simple data structure implementation efficiency question. I’m pretty glad I studied my data structures beforehand. It took me a while (and a few hints) before I came to the correct solution. It was sort of a “well duh!!” moment, but I’m gla...",

I should probably move on to more complicated algorthms next like Dijkstra’s Algorithm and dynamic programming algorithms like the all pairs shortest path algorithm. I don’t think Google would ask me about specific implmentations of these, but it would be good practice to get back into the mindset of designing algorithms this complex, since I haven’t had to do so in a while. I saw a sample interview question from some blog asking about defining a function f(a,b) to return a string that is all of the characters in a (in order) that are also in b. They ask for an order n2 as well as an order n algorithm. The n2 one seems trivial, but I can’t think of how to calculate a set intersection (which...",

After switching the Wii from 480i to 480p, the difference is pretty noticeable. Before, I could see the picture getting blurry where the cursor was moving. It was kinda weird. With the component cables, that doesn’t happen anymore. I tried playing Zelda: Twilight Princess. There’s a huge difference with the cables. Before it was super blurry, and now it’s somewhat jaggy. Sure, the antialiasing could use work, but it still looks 100% better. If you have a Wii and a TV that takes component input, you MUST get cables. These ones were like $13, shipping included.",

Here are 4 reasons why the Apple iPhone will fail: 1. Public Acceptance: The average person doesn’t even use the WAP browser on their phone, let alone any full blown OSX apps! What people want in a mobile phone is a phone; they don’t need all of these extras. Extra software just makes it more difficult to perform the main function of the phone: to make phone calls. 2.

While I had a pretty good background in programming, I hadn’t done the kind of stuff for video games before. The first assignment in the class was to come up with some kind of game concept that would end up being a project for the class. I really love RPGs, and the more offbeat they are, the better. One of my favorites is Earthbound for the SNES. I also dig the SRPGs from Nippon Ichi like Disgaea. Originally I wanted to do a Strategy RPG in the setting of campus life. It was called “UNM Tactics!” The whole SRPG thing didn’t turn out so well, and in the end, we made a generic style university RPG instead. We kept the name as UNM Tactics, even though it wasn’t really a tactics type game. We used RPG Maker XP, which is a really easy to use frontend system for, well, making RPGs. After pulling a few all nighters, we finished the final presentation, and as a pleasant surprise, I got an A+! After the c...",

The thing is split up into four parts that are about 10 minutes each, so it ends up being a 40 minute movie. The great part about this movie is that it gets pretty much every gag right. Like the random NPCs just wandering back and forth, and the girl who says the same thing when you talk to her twice. Or the ludicrousness of some small object blocking your path, or how it seems normal to go into someone’s house (dorm room) and steal all of their stuff… The movie makes heavy use of video game music and sound effects. It’s really sad because I could recognize where almost all of the music came from. You can watch College Saga in 10 minute bite size chunks, or just watch the whole thing right here: This totally reminds me of my UNM RPG that I made for that video game class I took. I gotta post that online someday…",

So I guess in that respect, Wirefly wins. I’m actually thinking about getting a new phone, so I just “pretended” to buy a new phone at both stores. The Motorola Razr V3t immediately comes to mind as something I’d like to buy. At Wirefly, the phone is $49.99 with a $50 rebate. At Amazon.com, the phone is $24.99 with a $50 rebate and a $25 rebate. The prices after rebate are $.01 and -$50.01 for Wirefly and Amazon.com, respectively. These are both the price paid when bought with a plan. I think Amazon.com is pretty much the standard when it comes to buying phone service online. They have a pretty good reputation and very good prices. I can’t say anything about Wirefl...",

Here’s a few select responses to the post I made last night: I saw 10 60GB ones in my BB store. Some people looked at the box for awhile and then wondered off. I think the $599 price scares most people away. They had numerous PS3 at BB near Regency here in Jacksonville, FL. They are just sitting there. I have passed on PS3’s at two different stores in the last week. All three stores (Bestbuy and TRU) had more than 5 or 6 just sitting there. I asked workers in the game area and they both said they had been there a few days. Just not worth it to most people.

Phoenix Wright is a lawyer game. Yeah, that’s right, you play as a defense lawyer. Your job is to prove that your client is innocent, even when the evidence is strongly against him. While this might not sound like the coolest idea for a game, it actually works pretty well. You listen to witnesses give their testimony and try to find inconsistencies. If they lie, you press them until they admit to it, or present evidence that proves that they’re lying. It’s pretty fun. Right now I’m on the third case, where I need to prove that an action star is innocent of murder. The characters are all fairly amusing, and the story isn’t bad either.

The good thing about ReviewMe is that they don’t require positive reviews. So bloggers aren’t forced to shill a website or product.

Wei picked a way too big pumpkin and we started. But there was a lack of tools. Apparently the blades kept on breaking off of the handles for the carving tools. I went into MacGyver mode and made a custom shiv out of one of the blades and a napkin. It worked okay, but it also made my hands really tired. Anyway, it took like, 20 minutes to get the top off of the damn thing. Then it took a few more minutes to scrape all of the crap from the inside out. Once we finished doing that, they announced that all participants had 5 minutes to finish their pumpkins… We ended up just trying to finish, but we both had class to go to. I took the pumpkin home and finished it there. Here’s the result! It’s really badly proportioned, since the pumpkin is huge and the face is tiny. I do like, however, having a pattern of an actu...",

I thought my last one was gonna be in 2002, but I ended up doing marching band this year on a whim. It was a pretty good end to a marching career. And by that, I mean the show was horrible. The music part was okay, but marching was crazy. First off, the hashes for the high school bands are about 4 steps away from our normal ones. This threw off pretty much every set. Next, the sun was shining directly on the grass, and I could barely even see where the lines were painted. That’s not all. For some reason, my throat got super dry, and by the end, I could barely play anything at all. Luckily this happened before I took my solo. There’s more!

Most hosting services have single machines that will serve 5 or so users at once. The problem with these is that one user using many resources will slow down the rest of their neighbors’ sites too. I think this is what I’ve been doing with my sites… The whole idea of the grid thing is that each user will be on one large group of computers. If a user doesn’t use many resources, great. If the user uses many, the grid can accommodate that. Maybe. I’m really interested in this service and I might actually switch hosts. My host has been battling uptime for months now.

The geo panel stuff is also still present. Basically the only thing that has changed are the characters and the setting. As for the story, it’s ok. It centers around a human, Adell, trying to summon a powerful demon overlord into changing his family back into humans. They were turned into demons a few years back.

Mr. Jackson is very convincing, and I’m kinda scared that he’ll kill me if I don’t see Snakes on a Plane. This is pure genius viral marketing, right here. The only complaint I have is that SLJ doesn’t know how to say a lot of names. Including “Hung.” Oh, I guess it would’ve been cool if he had dropped the F-bomb a few times, or even if he just said “ass” instead of “butt.” Oh, if you didn’t know, Snakes on a Plane is a movie.

If you’re still not convinced, read this post. Disgaea 2 is coming out in America on August 29, so I gotta be ready! NIS America actually has a somewhat sweet pre-order package available. For $75, you can get the Disgaea 2 game (duh), A strategy guide, a volume of the Disgaea manga, an art book, and the official soundtrack. Yeah! There’s some other digital download things too, like the game manual and some mouse cursor or something. There’s also a different package for $65 that only doesn’t include the manga. Lame.

The idea is that you’ll find new music you’ll like and buy tons. It seems like their algorithm is pretty complicated: Together we set out to capture the essence of music at the most fundamental level. We ended up assembling literally hundreds of musical attributes or “genes” into a very large Music Genome. Taken together these genes capture the unique and magical musical identity of a song – everything from melody, harmony and rhythm, to instrumentation, orchestration, arrangement, lyrics, and of course the rich world of singing and vocal harmony. It’s not about what a band looks like, or what genre they supposedly belong to, or about who buys their records –...",

It cost a pretty penny ($280 shipped), but it also came with two games that I already have. So I can auction those off to bring the price down.

It has a picture of a tooth under an umbrella… Random Buddhist Charms My brother told me these were to hang in my car so I don’t get into so many car wrecks. I actually have a Mr. T air freshener protecting my car right now, so I pity the fool who tries to smash into it! Ichigo Candy So this candy says “ichigo” on it, which means strawberry. It also says “ramune” like the drink. I haven’t opened it yet, but it looks sorta pez-like in nature. Melonpanna Stamp This Melonpanna thing is a character from some anime. The base comes off and has a hidden stamp! Melonpanna spins frantically when you use the stamp. Pretty cool, but I wish it had a melon pan scent to it too… Also pictured is the capsule that the toys came in, and the Final Fan...",

Sometimes I have to go through 10 or more windows to find what I’m looking for! With two monitors, I could have a web browser one (for example), and a work one. Because, yes, web browser != work. Or I should say, web browser = !work. While it would be nice to have a dual monitor setup, it would also cost twice as much. And I bet movies wouldn’t look too good with the gap in the middle.

I was in a group of about 30 or so people auditioning. First, we took a tour of the American Idol facilities (which I don’t really think exist). They mainly consisted of empty rooms and hallways. It was sort of like a cross between Costco and a warehouse. After the tour, they split up the guys and the girls (just like in the show!) and the girls auditioned first. They all went into the audition room together. Whenever a girl would walk out of the room, you could hear music (it was sort of like a rock concert in there).

In short, the study showed that the researchers’ predictions were spot-on. Participants scoring in the bottom quartile grossly overestimated their test performance and ability, and analysis confirmed that this miscalibration was due to deficits in metacognitive skill (the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error).

I figured, “if it’s cool enough for hardcore otaku, it’s cool enough for me!” I think I’m getting old. Sure, the moves are all fireball/hold back forward type moves, but there’s other complicated things built in. The game supports 4 players at once, which is kinda cool, but that means you have to do your own turning. Also, I fo...",

Then I started thinking about the words to the theme song, but I could only remember “at the bottom of the sea…” So then I looked up “Sealab 2021 theme” on google, and found the official Calamine website! They’re the band that did the theme, and they offer a free MP3 of it for download! Pretty cool how stream of consciousness web browsing works, huh? They’ve also got some other clips of their songs too. The singer has this cool sultry voice, and the music is in a new genre that they define as “Dreamy Pop.” I especially like the song “Trampoline,” though I wish the clip was longer. They seem like a fairly indie band, so maybe I’ll buy their CD.",

Also, I don’t think our teacher really cares if I turn stuff in somewhat late. She didn’t even realize I wasn’t there on Monday!

It can be worn over or under work clothes, and has flexible left- or right-handed straps that enclose dual 2-cell Li-polymer rechargable batteries. Claimed battery life is six hours in “fully operational” mode, or eight hours under normal circumstances. It actually seems a bit hefty for a wristwatch, but so does my Abacus. I’d still wear it! What with the whole six hour battery life thing, I’m thinking this isn’t meant for use as a watch, but a computer that you wear while you’re using it.

Mother 3 is coming to the Gameboy Advance, which means I can play it on my Nintendo DS. I really liked Earthbound a lot (though not as much as my cousin), so I might import it and struggle through the Japanese to play it. The graphics are going to be just as spritey as on the SNES version, so I have a feeling this game will be retro RPGing at its best. Mother 3 will be released in Japan on 4-20-06, so until then, be satisfied with the “presents.”",

The iPod hi-fi is just an overpriced jukebox that you can stick your iPod on. iYawn. It seems that Apple is tired of letting all the third-party manufacturers profit from the iPod, so now they’re making overpriced accessories as well. The iPod hi-fi costs $349. iPod Leather Case Speaking of overpriced accessories, check out iPod Leather Case! Only $99! If this is a “fun new product” for Apple, I’m not impressed.

Some wonderfully pissed person has made a video showing exactly how long it takes to load Smackdown vs. Raw 2006 on a PSP. Thankfully, they overlay the audio with the music from Benny Hill, which makes it somewhat bearable. I believe the issue here is that the designers of the game decided to put all of the crap that was in the PS2 version and just stick it into the PSP without considering anything. Instead of making a game for the PSP, they just crammed too much in there. My favorite part of the video is where it takes about 10 seconds for the game to load up… the loading screen!

Lately, though, they’ve been veering off course and going into some bad territory. When every other release from a rock band is a kid’s album, something is wrong. I have a feeling they’ve sold out, and they’re “over the hill” now, so to speak. Anyway, back to the band at hand. Of Montreal is this crazy indie type band that plays just the kind of music I like. Insane music! The lyrics usually don’t make any sense, and when they do, they form some kind of grandiose plot, kind of like a rock opera. Many of their song names don’t even make sense.

      "content": "So I downloaded this show called “The IT Crowd.” It’s some kind of British sitcom based on two guys and a girl in the IT department of a big company. In case you don’t know, “IT” stands for “Information Technology” and basically means the department that fixes all the computer problems and controls the technology of a company. Yes, this show is geared towards nerds. The two guys are computer nerds, and the new girl knows nothing about computers. Blatant stereotypes aside, this show is very smart. The mise-en-scene in the basement has random computer parts everywhere, and geeks in the know will recognise the EFF stickers posted on pretty much everything. The great part about this show is that on top of being funny, it’s also super random. I guess the British have a better appreciation for random crazy humor than Americans. My only major gripe has to do with the addition of a laugh track. I don’t need people telling me when to laugh! It seems to have a very limited target audience, bu...",

Hell, that’s probably how this game was originally designed. Anyhow, I feel the map speaks for itself. This is really distressing. I’m assuming this is some kind of parody thing, but Chicago is some kind of mega fortress, Alaska has an ice palace, Montana seems to be some kind of Neko City, and Saint Paul has a giant one of those bird things that drink water! Most of America also seems to be covered in impassable mountain terrain. At least they had a location from New Mexico: Carlsbad Caverns!

The art seemed pretty cool, and I was surprised at times how “modern” the stuff from the 70’s looked. I was hoping there’d be more Yuri and less Yaoi, but what can ya do!? We also got to talk to Masami Toku (the director of the project) briefly about the history of shoujo manga.The exhibit runs until around the middle of the month (I think), so if you’re at UNM, check it out at Maisley Gallery. I also snuck out with a copy of Shoujo Beat Manga Sampler! “Snuck out” not as in stealing (it’s free after all) but as in getting away with it as a guy.

It’s sort of like a game controller that can provide feedback in all directions. There were some texture demos, and a few games like launch the duck, where you grab a duck in a slingshot, pull it back, and let go. The cool thing is you can feel opposing force when you pull the duck back. It doesn’t feel quite perfect yet, but I believe it’s still in development. It was still really fun moving this device around (the one we used didn’t have a pen, it was more like a door knob), and feeling it respond. I have a feeling that this device will end up being a novelty, unless it sees huge support from every developer in the world. Sure, it can be used for other stuff like medical simulations, but in the field of video games, I’m not too sure it’ll take off. Here’s the official company line: The Novint Falcon, which is ...",

I was looking for an alarm clock that you could set for every weekday, and apparently one just came out called the Neverlate 7-day alarm clock. It looks pretty awesome, and it’s $30 to avoid resetting that damn alarm every damn night. The only thing is, it just came out, so there’s no reviews, and it’s American made, which means it’ll probably break before a week has actually passed. Well, I think I might get it anyway, but what do you, my reader(s) think?",

At some point in my dream, I decided it would be a good idea to try and test my tooth’s durability, by getting some pliers and yanking on it. Lo and behold, my tooth came out, rather quickly. This undermined my entire good dream, because then I was left trying to compensate for my newly acquired speech impediment. Looking in the mirror (the dream mirror), I found that my grin took on a rather pathetic visage. After a while, I figured I would try and reinsert the tooth, so I grabbed the tooth, which was now about 4 times larger than it was before, and quite filthy, and started jamming it into the socket. Of course, this didn’t hurt, it was a dream. After I somewhat successfully re-inserted the tooth, it was still a bit wobbly. This is when I woke up, and had to actually check to see if my to...",
