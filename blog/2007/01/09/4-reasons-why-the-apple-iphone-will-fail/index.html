</center>

<p>The focus of today’s Macworld 2007 was definitely the iPhone. While general consensus is that the iPhone is the next killer app, I still have my doubts. Here are 4 reasons why the Apple iPhone will fail:</p>

<p><strong>1. Public Acceptance:</strong></p>

<p>The average person doesn’t even use the WAP browser on their phone, let alone any full blown OSX apps! What people want in a mobile phone is a phone; they don’t need all of these extras. Extra software just makes it more difficult to perform the main function of the phone: to make phone calls.</p>

<p><strong>2. Price:</strong></p>

<p>The price of the iPhone was announced at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB with a 2 year contract. Right now, you can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM8REU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=basugasubakuhatsu-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000EM8REU">T-Mobile MDA smartphone</a> for $0 after rebate. The mass market is not willing to pay this much for a phone.</p>

<p><strong>3. Copyright and Regulations:</strong></p>

<p>There already is an iPhone out. It’s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JI5L02?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=basugasubakuhatsu-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000JI5L02">Linksys Wireless-G Skype iPhone</a>. I hope Apple has a lot of money or lawyers to acquire the rights to the name.</p>

<p>Pair this with the fact that the iPhone doesn’t have FCC approval and we might never see the iPhone get to market. How did Steve make all of those phone calls anyway?</p>

<p><strong>4. Battery Life:</strong></p>

<p>The iPhone runs OSX! This is great for a laptop or a desktop computer, but does a phone really need OSX? The battery life was announced as 5 hours of talk time, browsing, or video. Basically, 5 hours of active use. What happens after that? Your phone is dead and no one can call you.</p>

<p>People are not going to use the iPhone’s features for fear of losing their connectivity when the battery runs out.</p>

    <p>Ok, 1,2 and 4 are plausible reasones, but do you honestly think that Apple didn’t know about the wireless iphone?? They more than likely have some sort of agreement about the name. Apple thinks about these things carefully before releasing, and wouldn’t committ that sort of mistake. 
 The other ones could be valid, but if this gets any of the hype and run that the razr got, it could mean OSX devices in alot more homes, which is what apple is looking for. because it sells more things on itunes.</p>

    <p>Interesting points but I have to say I agree with bob. I am pretty sure they made some intense market research. People beeing able to use iPods are probably also able to use the iPhone. Personally speaking I never bought a smartphone as they all lacked in at least one area ( design, ergonomics, display, keyboard, etc…). Now I can get an music player carrying all my contacts, bookmarks, notes etc and replacing also my phone. Sounds too good to be true.</p>

    <p>Don’t forget that the Shuffle would only dial random numbers in your phonebook.
As cool and gimicky as the iPhone is, Steve Jobs’ presentation still screamed out “wait for 2nd gen” to me.</p>

    <p>There are currently about 787,000 hits on Google for the search http://www.google.com/search?q=why+iphone+will+fail&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a
This is enough to tell me that the hype is the only substance there is to the iPhone right now. The four reasons you mention are not the only ones. I know a lot of people that don’t use mobile music players OR smart phones. I think that the 1% goal stated is too high. This also leads into this problem: the small number of people that will use a smart phone with music player have to have the following qualifications:
-Willing to spend the money
-Willing to get out of their current contract
-Willing to dump their current smartphone/music player
-Willing to accept Apple’s DRM
Sure, there are tons of people with iPod music players, but how many of them actually paid for them? How many of them were presents for kids who want to be seen as ‘cool’ at school?
There are cheaper alternatives for people that don’t want to be iPeople, and these devices have similar or better features. Sure, the fun finger GUI is different, but who cares really? Its not voice recognition, nor does it make the phone easier to use per se’. Oh, and did I mention, those other alternatives are not locked into Cingular, so many people will be able to choose a smart phone music player combo that is already on their plan – that is a huge bonus.
Once the fan boys settle down and actually try using this iPhone, perhaps we’ll see the end of this sickening din of hype. The hype is going to kill the iPhone because it won’t quite live up to the term ‘revolutionary’ in the world of cellular devices. It doesn’t even have 3G!</p>

    <p>you honestly think these 4 points are the first 4 points anyone would argue at the time about how the “iphone will fail”. nothing about the screen keyboard? internal battery?
the claims he makes are obviously joking.
take 2., for example. the price. this is clearly sarcasm as every phone with a carrier gets a discounted price with a contract. plus it’s not like apple’s premium price has ever been a problem. — do you know what a troll is? 
pc world guy just didn’t look into it enough and is trying to cover the tracks on his pointless article.</p>

    <p>Hi all,
Yes this author was wrong, and so were many other authors/bloggers on the net around this time period. Interestingly, at the moment, many people are writing/saying how the Apple Table will fail, but I know deep down it won’t fail one bit.</p>

    <p>The iPod was a success. The iPhone was a success. The iMac was a success. The iPad was a success. I’m really looking forward to see what Apple can do with the video game industry. I bet they would woop a**!</p>

    <p>No apple don’t make games so they would fail on the video games business.
And people don’t buy expensive consoles.
I think they should keep making better iPhones and iPad.</p>
