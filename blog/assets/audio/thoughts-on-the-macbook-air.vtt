Thoughts on the Macbook Air

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on January 15, 2008.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.820
So Apple announced the Macbook Air today.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.280
I was hoping for something like a major upgrade to the Macbook Pro, but this is kinda cool, too.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.360
It’s thin, which is really nice.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.540
I used to have a Dell 300m that was about 3 pounds.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.280
I liked it a lot for the portability; unfortunately the build quality wasn’t great and the screen developed some issues.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.560
But basically, that’s all the Macbook Air is: a thinner Macbook with less features that costs more.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.740
Unless you’re a weakling, the benefit of having a slightly lighter computer isn’t really worth all that you’re losing.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.680
Sure, there’s stuff like the multi-touch and um… isn’t that about it?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.760
I was totally ready to buy whatever new awesomeness Apple had ready for the Macbook Pro, but I guess I’ll forgo buying one until they do get an upgrade.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.260
At this point, I can buy a refurbished Macbook Pro for about the same price (or less) as a new Macbook Air.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.480
But I don’t really need a Macbook Pro since my normal Macbook is still chugging along nicely…
