PowerSet: Good For Searching Wikipedia!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.860
Published on May 12, 2008.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.340
There have been quite a few blogs today comparing the newly released preview of PowerSet (an alternative search engine) Vs. Google.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:25.080
The line we’ve been reading for a while now is that PowerSet uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to figure out what you want to find, not just stuff that sort of has what you want to find in its body text.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.480
Previous comparisons have been throwing out things like “what does an orange taste like?” or “what is the capital of New Zealand?”

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.300
No one asks those kinds of questions.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.520
Therefore, I will just search “who is Hung Truong?” since I’m sure lots of people want to know.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.300
It’s probably the most popular search term of all time, really.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.780
The Google search does pretty well.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.840
6/10 links on the first page are actually attributable to me, Hung Truong (the most popular Hung Truong on Google today!).

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.600
Hmmm… Powerset just returns a bunch of stuff from Wikipedia.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.220
Unfortunately, I don’t have a Wikipedia article (yet)!

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.600
0/10 of the first 10 results are actually about me.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.640
So there you have it.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.940
Google beats PowerSet because PowerSet is only good for searching Wikipedia at the moment.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.560
Usually, when I want to search Wikipedia, I use Wikipedia.
