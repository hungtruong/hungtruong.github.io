Wii Fit Anniversary!

00:00:03.658 --> 00:00:05.895
Published on May 21, 2009.

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:10.411
So today is the very near anniversary of me starting Wii Fit.

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:19.062
My first day was actually May 23rd 2008, but I think If I wait to post something I might forget to do it in two days.

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:21.720
So here’s my anniversary post.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.355
It’s actually kind of interesting that for the last few sessions I’ve been feeling pretty tired.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.891
Today I felt really energized though.

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:32.750
I have no idea why.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.645
I was sick the past few days but today I feel pretty much at 100%.

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.702
Maybe it’s because I got a lot of sleep while sick.

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:45.118
I also had a Twig and Berry salad from Zingerman’s today for lunch.

00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:53.390
Anyway, when I started Wii Fit about a year ago I was obese (according to the machine) and weighed about 202 pounds or so.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.803
Today the Wii Fit declared I am merely overweight and that I weigh about 179.9.

00:01:00.303 --> 00:01:02.861
So within a year I lost 20 pounds.

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:07.756
I actually lost the 20 pounds between May and November, I wanna say.

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:12.571
Then between November and now, I think I hit some kind of ceiling (or floor).

00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:15.708
I’ve sort of slowly been losing again.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.046
I think it might be a seasonal thing.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:25.599
Besides the lost poundage, I’ve been consistently feeling better (physically) ever since I started, and have been getting better and better.

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:30.734
I’m also considering using a cutting stack just to get those last few pounds off.

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:39.065
These days I can walk to and back from campus very easily when a year ago it’d feel like a hike (it’s a little over a mile each way, I think).

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:43.321
I believe my general endurance and energy levels have been better, too.

00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:47.177
I haven’t only been doing Wii Fit to get healthier though.

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:51.353
I’ve also been trying to eat better and live more healthily in general.

00:01:51.853 --> 00:01:54.011
No more soda (pop) for me.

00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:58.047
I’m pretty happy with my progress with Wii Fit so far.

00:01:58.547 --> 00:02:10.295
I wish I had done better between the November-Now time points, though I will admit that I made non-pound progress (I am now doing 20 push-ups instead of 10 and lunges are doable when before they were insanely hard).

00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:15.031
Hopefully I’ll be able to report back in a year with even better numbers and results.

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:20.426
Bonus actual anniversary update: (5/23/09)

00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:27.659
I look at my time completed in Wii Fit and it appears that I did 83 hours and 33 minutes of working out.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.038
Not too bad.

00:02:29.538 --> 00:02:36.570
I know I did less in the beginning and have been ramping up to about 34-45 minutes of workout each session though I don’t do it every day.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.066
I’ll probably have more time to commit to working out over this summer though.
