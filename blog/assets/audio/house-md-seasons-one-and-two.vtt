House MD Seasons One and Two!

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.540
Published on June 22, 2007.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.340
I just got my House M.D. Seasons One and Two DVD from Amazon.com today.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.280
It took like a month!

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.940
I guess they sold a bunch and ran out.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.640
Anyway, I watched the first disc today (both sides).

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.400
I started randomly watching House when I saw it on TV one day.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.460
I really liked it, though I never actually “plan” my TV watching, so I hardly ever see it.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.400
I just bought the DVDs so I could see the first two seasons.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.660
I think I saw like, 2 or 3 episodes from this past season.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.780
One thing I’ve noticed about House is that patients going into seizures usually mean a commercial break.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.000
I guess it’s just good TV writing to have a seizure plus fade to black… Also, the doctors really love Diazepam , which goes along with the many seizures.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.260
I remember Diazepam from Metal Gear Solid, which would help you relax to use the sniper rifle.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.620
I think a drinking game where you take a drink when a patient goes into seizure, or when House’s initial treatment fails would pretty do the job for anyone.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.640
No other rules required.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.960
So far, the series is really good.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.660
Sure, the plots get a little redundant and formulaic, but nothing like Inspector Gadget.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.240
Plus at least the characters develop.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.260
It may take me a while to watch the whole set, but I’ve got nothing but free time this Summer anyway!
