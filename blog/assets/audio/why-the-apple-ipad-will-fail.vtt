Why the Apple iPad Will Fail

00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:06.295
Published on January 27, 2010.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:12.409
Edit: Cool, looks like my blog got posted to from some hack blog called “PCWorld.”

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:19.861
I will note that while it is easy to make dumb predictions about the future, it is even easier to go back and look at the incorrect ones.

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:25.476
If everyone made accurate predictions about the iPhone, it would’ve existed before Apple invented it.

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:29.732
Please keep the comments section nice, or I might pull an Engadget.

00:00:30.232 --> 00:00:32.149
My mom reads this, you know!

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.666
Once upon a time, I made a post about how the iPhone was going to fail .

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:41.880
I did it mostly for lulz and also to try and get on the front page of Digg.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.538
Seriously, that post was diggbait !

00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:49.593
That was back when people still went to Digg and people still tried to get on the main page of Digg.

00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:56.086
The interesting thing is that post got a lot more commentary than other technology posts I made before and since then.

00:00:57.086 --> 00:01:01.242
Today, I feel the urge to write a post about how the iPad thing will fail.

00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:03.420
This time, I actually mean it.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.934
In essence, the iPad is just a giant iPhone with no camera, no microphone and no phone.

00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:14.189
What it gains in screen size it loses in a lot of core functionality.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.445
It doesn’t even really bother me so much that they took out important features.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.224
It’s what they left in.

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:23.861
The iPad works on the iPhone OS.

00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:31.313
This could be a good idea, except that they really didn’t consider that making a device four times bigger might introduce some design considerations.

00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:33.971
The iPad is quite literally a giant iPhone.

00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:40.225
Most iPhone games, etc (at least, those not requiring a mic or camera) are supposed to work on it.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:50.794
But when you think about it, what games using the accelerometer will actually work out of the box when you’re dealing with something 1.5 pounds heavy and clunkier than a handheld device?

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:54.411
Shaking a tablet is different from shaking a small phone.

00:01:55.411 --> 00:02:01.004
I’m not sure if the designers were just lazy or if they didn’t care at all about the new scale.

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:04.381
The mail app looks like it was hacked into the iPad.

00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:11.434
It should look like it was designed for the thing, but for some reason we still have the really thin column and a bunch of whitespace. WTF?

00:02:12.434 --> 00:02:16.909
I suppose that Apple needed to release the thing and do it with an unpolished product.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:25.800
Some apps look well designed, like the iBooks one (clever naming convention there, Apple), but most look like they were just stretched to fit the larger resolution.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.456
A lot of companies could get away with this, but I think people expect more from Apple.

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:37.189
If Apple wants to control the entire end user experience, they should take that responsibility with a burden.

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.228
My predictions:

00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:43.184
Apple will get better at designing apps for the iPad.

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:45.522
The best ones will come from them.

00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:49.719
Most developer apps will look like crap on the iPad.

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.098
A few will “get it.”

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:53.515
Those ones will be successful.

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:59.710
Most developers will probably find developing (quality) apps too difficult on the damn thing, give up.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.904
People will realize that they don’t want a computing device that only allows Apple-approved software on it.

00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:13.436
They’ll stick with the Macbook, which can do much more than an iPad and runs any third-party software, including Flash and Firefox.
