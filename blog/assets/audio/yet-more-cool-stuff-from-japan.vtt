Yet More Cool Stuff From Japan!

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.140
Published on May 12, 2006.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.260
So my brother recently came back from a trip to Japan, and he brought back some stuff for me!

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.320
Here’s an inventory of the random junk I got:

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.080
Dr. Clinic Gum

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.540
So the only reason he bought this gum was the weird name.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.600
I guess it’ll fix my breath or something.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.820
It has a picture of a tooth under an umbrella…

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060
Random Buddhist Charms

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.960
My brother told me these were to hang in my car so I don’t get into so many car wrecks.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.700
I actually have a Mr. T air freshener protecting my car right now, so I pity the fool who tries to smash into it!

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.300
Ichigo Candy

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.400
So this candy says “ichigo” on it, which means strawberry.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.060
It also says “ramune” like the drink.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.920
I haven’t opened it yet, but it looks sorta pez-like in nature.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.600
Melonpanna Stamp

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.300
This Melonpanna thing is a character from some anime.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.280
The base comes off and has a hidden stamp!

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.980
Melonpanna spins frantically when you use the stamp.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.760
Pretty cool, but I wish it had a melon pan scent to it too…

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.160
Also pictured is the capsule that the toys came in, and the Final Fantasy Advent Children insert thingy.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.440
Naruto Phone Thing

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.100
Sweet! It’s a Naruto phone thingy.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.320
You strap it onto your phone like a Japanese schoolgirl.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.060
It appears as though Naruto is either jumping, or on the ground in pain.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.320
I vote for the latter.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.420
He seems to do that a lot.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.780
Random Bubblegum

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.440
This bubblegum comes in three flavors: Cola, Grapefruit, and (tsubu tsubu?) Ichigo.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.660
It looks pretty good, so I’ll be consuming this shortly.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.460
Roz from Final Fantasy Advent Children

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.920
Believe it or not, I haven’t actually seen the movie yet, so I have no idea who this is.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.940
Cloud or Tifa would’ve been so awesome, but this is cool too.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.080
Is this guy a Turk or something?

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.300
I hardly remember the plot for Final Fantasy VII…

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.140
Super Mario Flashplate

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.360
Apparently, this is a pretty rare item.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.420
It’s a diorama with an lcd on it, and it flashes using solar power.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.520
It’s the thing in Super Mario Brothers where you can get the koopa troopa on a step, and get infinite 1-ups by jumping on it while it bounce back at you.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.940
I used to be able to do this as a kid, but I don’t really have the patience anymore…

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.220
Well, that’s all.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.360
Thanks to my brother for getting all this cool stuff.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.060
He really saved me a trip to Jlist.com .

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.080
You can see his blog here .
