Of DDR and Thievery

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.380

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.940
I had a very strange (and unusually memorable) dream last night.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.840
Then again, maybe all of my dreams are strange, but I just can’t remember them.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.280
It started off with me and my friend Patrick playing Dance Dance Revolution.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.140
I was getting AAs and he was doing pretty badly.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.840
Then my friend Tim came over and told the two of us that he could get AAA on any song we were trying.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.460
What a bluff!

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.600
I was curious as to see how Tim could be a DDR maniac, so we decided to drive to the mall (because I guess my home DDR wasn’t good enough?).

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.920
Tim and Patrick drive away, and I’m still getting into my car (I dunno why we didn’t carpool).

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.900
I remember that my cell phone is in my parents’ car, but I’m like, “I don’t need that!”

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.320
I try to follow them but they’re gone.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.660
Somehow, I get lost on the way to the mall, and curse myself for not bringing my cell phone to call them.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.400
This is strange, because the mall is only like, a few blocks away from my house.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.320
Somehow me and Patrick end up in a school, and he wants to look around.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.780
It happens to be some voting day, and there’s a bunch of senior citizens in a room sitting in desks writing up their ballots.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.200
Then whoever’s in charge of the election starts kicking the old people out and ripping up their ballots because they’re taking too long to vote.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.100
I’m mad, and start yelling about how that’s illegal, and they should let the old people vote.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.580
Suddenly, one of the old people steals something out of my messenger bag (like my PDA or something) and I chase her!

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.640
It’s one of those slow-motion dream chases.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.580
She’s really fast!

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.720
She gets into her car and I can’t catch her!

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.220
Later the police nab her, and I demand the death penalty, or at least the right to smack her down.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.820
I dunno if she ever got what was coming to her, but I was pissed.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.880
I don’t think I’d wish capital punishment on the elderly in real life, though.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.660
I guess it was just the frustration of running really slowly in the dream, and losing to an old lady in a race.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.700
Weird, huh?
