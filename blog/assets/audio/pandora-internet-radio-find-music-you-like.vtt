Pandora Internet Radio – Find Music You Like!

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.460
Published on July 13, 2006.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.740
So I guess this has been around for a while, and I tried it a long time ago and forgot about it.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.440
Pandora is this online radio thing.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.420
You give it an artist or a song that you like, and Pandora creates a radio station that plays music it thinks you’ll like.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.920
For instance, I made a “Toasters” radio station, and it mostly plays ska.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.100
The idea is that you’ll find new music you’ll like and buy tons.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.140
It seems like their algorithm is pretty complicated:

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.620
Together we set out to capture the essence of music at the most fundamental level.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.360
We ended up assembling literally hundreds of musical attributes or “genes” into a very large Music Genome.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:01:04.300
Taken together these genes capture the unique and magical musical identity of a song – everything from melody, harmony and rhythm, to instrumentation, orchestration, arrangement, lyrics, and of course the rich world of singing and vocal harmony.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.440
It’s not about what a band looks like, or what genre they supposedly belong to, or about who buys their records – it’s about what each individual song sounds like.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.880
It’s actually done a pretty good job of finding music I like.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.140
The Aquabats station plays a lot of music I already own and like.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.400
The other songs are okay too.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.760
After playing with it for a few days, I have a few complaints.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.500
First, they repeat themselves way too much.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.200
I’ve heard The Toaster’s “Can I Get Another” like, four times already!

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.140
Next, they only let you skip so many songs every hour.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.360
You can get around this by making more than one station and switching them (which will play a new song!).

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.920
Other than the weak variety of songs, Pandora seems to work pretty well.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.740
It’s at least nice to have free music that you’ll probably like streaming automatically.
