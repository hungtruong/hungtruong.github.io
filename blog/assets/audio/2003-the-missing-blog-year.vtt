2003: The Missing Blog Year

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.100
Published on March 09, 2008.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.540
So for some reason I was looking at the archives of my blog today.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.440
I noticed that there was a gap between the years of 2004 and 2003.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.900
I obviously didn’t stop blogging completely in 2003, so I figured something was up.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.380
I’ve been blogging for a number of years now.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.720
The earliest protoblog I had was probably on ujournal.org.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:40.460
After that I switched around a lot, to places like Xanga, livejournal, Myspace (ugh, yeah, I know) and finally to my own domain where my blog resides today.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.240
I’ve made it a point to export all my old blog entries though, so I was kind of pissed to see that 2003 was nowhere to be found.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:56.900
Sure enough, I checked out my old livejournal (which still exists!) and exported all the posts from 2003 into my blog this afternoon.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.340
A few notes on my blogging style of 2003:

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.140
I used exclamation points in my titles a lot.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.540
I mostly blogged about news events.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.080
Unfortunately, Yahoo News links die fairly fast.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.920
All links referencing my UNM webspace are seriously borked

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.080
For some reason I wrote about Ebay a lot!

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.040
In 2003, my blog really sucked.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:37.360
There are a few noteworthy posts from that year, including the self imaging post (which links to a broken site now…), the Ebay commercial post (which links to a working video!!!) and my rant about Humpty Dumpty .

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.200
You can see all the missing posts here .

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.820
If you really wanted to.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.680
Which you probably don’t.
