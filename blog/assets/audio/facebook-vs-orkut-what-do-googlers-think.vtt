Facebook Vs. Orkut: What Do Googlers Think?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.500
Published on April 21, 2007.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.940
So I was browsing the various Facebook networks that exist for things like regions, universities, and workplaces.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.880
Being a fan of Google, I checked to see how many Googlers (Google employees) are on Facebook.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.180
The count as of right now? 2,041.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.540
Okay, fair enough.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.000
Googlers are allowed to be on social networks, right?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.940
But Google has a social network of their own, Orkut !

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.240
To be fair, Orkut is very popular with Brazilians (for some reason), but it has yet to catch on in North America.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.860
But shouldn’t Orkut be popular among Googlers?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.720
It is, after all, a product that’s made by their own company.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.000
I tried to find an “official” Google group on Orkut.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.700
Of the Googlers that I know (okay, like one), they’re either in the “Google (863)” group or the “Google (1,301)” group.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.920
Keep in mind that on Orkut, anyone can join the Google group, whereas on Facebook, you must have a valid Google email to join.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.260
To be nice, let’s just call the one with 1,301 members the “official” Googler group.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.900
This means that Orkut has 1,301 Googlers vs. Facebook’s 2,041… ouch.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.260
I think this just illustrates my belief that Google really needs to put some work into Orkut to make it a viable social network.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.800
Right now, I think they’re just sort of letting it sit there.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.100
It’s really uncharacteristic of a Google product, and it’s something that’s surprised me ever since I found out that Orkut was owned by Google.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.700
How can Google do this?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.280
Give Orkut some personality!

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.180
Right now it’s incredibly dull to use.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.480
I think the reason people use Facebook (at least, the reason I do) is that it’s fun.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.100
Facebook has random crap that doesn’t make logical sense, but is fun anyway (like poking).

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.880
That’s why I really like Facebook as a social network, and why I think it’d be a fun company to work for.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.740
The work atmosphere at Google is incredibly fun, which is why I can’t understand why Orkut is so boring.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.440
Even Myspace lets users customize the layout.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.060
Though this is bad for the eyes, users like it.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.300
This isn’t so much of an attack on Orkut than it is a wake-up call.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.920
I really think that with the resources that Google has, they could create a great social network.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.180
Right now it’s wasting away.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.100
And to end on a fun note, here’s a joke that I found on Valleywag :

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:46.700
Orkut Büyükkökten, creator of the Google social network that bears his name, dashes into CEO Eric Schmidt’s office and says, “We have a million Brazilian users!”

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.440
Eric says, “Keep up the good work.”

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.740
After Orkut leaves, Eric calls VP Marissa Mayer and asks, “How many is a brazillion again?”
