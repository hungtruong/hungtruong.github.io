Craigslist and Google Maps Mashup Thingy: Day 6 – MySQL Refactoring

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.860
Published on April 12, 2007.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.060
One of the things I didn’t really care about when I was coming up with my Google Maps Craigslist mashup thing was the correctness of the database schema.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.800
I’ve written database schema before, but this time I just got sort of lazy.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.820
When porting the application to CakePHP, I realized it was a bad idea to slack off.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.880
Today I spent some time refactoring and adding a association table to the db.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.360
I also learned some more MySQL syntax stuff.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.420
Previously, I had worked with Rails, which sort of handles the query making itself.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.760
Since I wrote a custom listing parser, I had to do some MySQL magic with JOINs and whatnot.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.800
I also worked a lot on the Facebook puzzle that I wrote about earlier today.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.540
I came up with an approach that was better than the last one I came up with, but only slightly.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.240
It’s still in the range of O(n), so I’ll have to figure out the last “clever” thing before I’ve got it finished.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.180
It’s actually a lot more interesting now due to the efficiency constraints.
