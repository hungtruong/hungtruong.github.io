So today Google wrote a post about offline Gmail .

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.165
Whoa, amazing! Now I can use email even when I’m not connected to the internet!

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:21.341
I can read mail, and compose mail, and it’ll send the mail when I get back online!!!

00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:25.617
Oh, wait. There was a solution for all that years ago.

00:00:26.117 --> 00:00:27.395
It’s called IMAP!!!!

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:39.104
Now, it’s true you can’t star stuff/archive/etc in an IMAP client but c’mon, offline Gmail is not the revolutionary development that people are making it out to be!
