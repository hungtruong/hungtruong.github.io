Not another prison abuse scandal !

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.440
This time it’s at the Guantanamo Bay place. Quote:

In one common procedure, uncooperative prisoners were stripped down to their underwear, made to sit in a chair with their hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor, and forced to listen to blaring rock and rap music in a room with flashing strobe lights, a military official said.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.920
Wait a minute, they’ve just described a bitchin’ rave!

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.780
Well, leave out the whole shackling thing and it might be a cool rave.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.960
I’m not sure if the Geneva Conventions allow for rave torture or not.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.780
Time to practice that orb dance where I’m pretending to be David Bowie in Labyrinth !
