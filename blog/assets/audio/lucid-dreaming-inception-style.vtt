Lucid Dreaming: Inception Style

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.614
Published on December 01, 2011.

00:00:07.614 --> 00:00:11.450
I often have the problem that the moment I realize I’m dreaming, I wake up.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.624
I never get a chance to do the cool stuff you’re supposed to do in a dream when you know what’s going on (like fly and whatnot).

00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:21.880
Last night, I did end up having a lucid dream of sorts.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.715
I was walking around a house when I realized I was dreaming.

00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:34.088
I read somewhere that you can spin around really fast, and apparently that helps you stay in the dream and not wake up when you realize you’re dreaming.

00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:36.985
I did this and was able to stay in the dream.

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:45.556
After that, I walked through the house some more and looked at the furnishings, thinking that I have a pretty cool brain for being able to invent that stuff on the fly.

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:48.853
Like, “wow, my mind just made up that sofa arrangement.”

00:00:49.853 --> 00:00:52.730
At this point, I decided to do something more fun.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.705
I tried moving parts of the house around with my mind, and see if I could demolish it.

00:00:58.205 --> 00:00:59.084
It didn’t work.

00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:03.340
Once I wasn’t able to control the dream, I woke up.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.794
After I woke up, I decided I would try to go back to sleep and dream the same dream.

00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:12.970
I wasn’t quite able to do this, though, because I was still dreaming!

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.626
What I thought was a lucid dream was really me dreaming that I was lucid dreaming.

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:21.961
I think this is the first case I can remember of having a dream inside of a dream.

00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:28.775
I’m pretty sure I was dreaming that I woke up, because I can recall actually waking up and it being quite different from my dream waking up.

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:36.967
I think it’s kind of interesting that I was able to keep dreaming even though I realized I was in a dream partially due to the fact that I was dreaming of dreaming.

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:40.663
The complexity of dreams continues to surprise and confuse me.

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:47.077
Hopefully I am writing this blog post in a non-dream, because I’d really like to have a record of this dream in a dream.
