What Happens in Denver Stays in Denver, Unless…

Published on April 06, 2006.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.340
It’s the 1st Annual Soundpack Syrup Chugging Contest!

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.920
Inspired by the Hollywood blockbuster hit, “ Super Troopers “, this year’s event pitted Eric Oliver (on the left) versus Jordan Sayre (on the right).

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.120
The competition seemed to be evenly matched at first.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.620
Both men had finished about 10% of their bottles, respectively.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.040
Then something incredible happened.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.460
Jordan Sayre pulled ahead with a strategy known as “squeezing the bottle.”

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.880
He won by quite a large margin.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.480
As a finishing taunt, Jordan said to Eric, “finish up!”

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.980
Eric reluctantly finished his bottle as the loser of the competition.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.020
The second annual Soundpack Syrup Chugging Contest is currently being planned for the Spring of 2007 in sunny Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.340
Note: Do not try this at home.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.640
All parties involved in the chugging contest eventually barfed all the syrup (and their dinner) after the competition was over.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.340
It was gross.
