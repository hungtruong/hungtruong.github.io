Twitter? I Hardly Know Her!

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.454
Published on March 12, 2009.

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:12.888
Sometimes it’s fun to go look at what I wrote, say, two years ago and compare it to how I feel now.

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:14.827
Case in point: Twitter .

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.404
Almost two years ago, I wrote that:

00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:24.718
Now, I actually use the Facebook updates now and then, but it seems like people who use Twitter do this to the max.

00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:27.135
Like they update multiple times a day.

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:31.791
Are these people so self-centered that they think everyone needs to know what they’re doing?

00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:36.686
… In Twitter, the ability to update is the entire application itself.

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:41.181
To me, Twitter is simply a subset of what Facebook already provides.

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.360
Why would you ever need both?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.675
This historical post is both illuminating and funny for a number of reasons.

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:53.170
Apparently in the past I hardly updated my Facebook status at all.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.465
These days I probably do so at least once a day, and usually multiple times a day.

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:09.594
I guess that’s just an indicator of how social norms have changed in regards to sharing personal information online: what was thought of as “oversharing” in the past is basically normal now.

00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:13.850
It’s also funny that I recognized that Twitter was a subset of Facebook.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.505
Recently I’ve come to believe that being a subset is actually a feature.

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:23.021
I think Twitter hit critical mass for me somewhere in the last few months.

00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:28.476
So really, my previous opinions of it being pointless weren’t necessarily incorrect.

00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:30.814
It just didn’t hold any value for me.

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:36.987
Now that the value of Twitter (in my own usage) is improving due to network effects , I use it more often.

00:01:37.987 --> 00:01:45.180
I think the appeal of Twitter comes down to this: There is a much better signal-to-noise ratio at this point using Twitter versus Facebook.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.433
On Facebook I get updates about everything that everyone I have ever known (and befriended) has ever done!

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:55.609
I don’t care about pictures of drunk cheerleaders who I was friends with in undergrad.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:01.863
But Facebook feeds them to me. I really should remove them at some point, but oh well, such is social networking.

00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:06.059
For now, Twitter has a much more relevant set of messages.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:13.112
I’ve also noticed that people are much more likely to respond to me via Twitter, versus commenting on a Facebook status.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.930
Probably due to the noise/signal thing again.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.103
It’s easy for me to simply “unfollow” someone who is not providing me with relevant or funny information.

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:26.999
Sadly, the relevance factor of Twitter is probably a temporary quality.

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:31.654
Facebook used to have a low S/N ratio until everyone joined it.

00:02:32.154 --> 00:02:36.869
Twitter may face the same problem if it can grow like Facebook did (lol at scaling).

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:41.465
It’s interesting to look at all of this in the context of history.

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:50.116
I used ujournal before I used Xanga before I used livejournal before I used MySpace (ick) before I used Facebook before I used Twitter before I used (fill in the blank)…
