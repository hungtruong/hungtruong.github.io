Thoughts on the Microsoft “Cheap PC” Ad

00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:06.694
Published on March 31, 2009.

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:11.610
So there was this Microsoft ad that came out during an NCAA game.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.866
It featured a cute girl, Lauren, trying to decide which computer to buy.

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:24.197
The voice of the ad (some omniscient being?) told her if she could find the kind she wanted under $1000 he’d buy it for her.

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:27.494
The computer she wanted at the Apple Store was too expensive.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:31.270
She chose a Windows PC instead for $700.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.627
A lot of people have claimed the ad is a huge success.

00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:38.764
It hits Apple in its weak point: price.

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:41.980
That may be true, but there’s also this thing called “value.”

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.357
Apple computers have always been about quality.

00:00:45.857 --> 00:00:48.734
Software quality, build quality, design.

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:54.189
While it’s true that the upfront costs of a Mac are higher than a PC, you get what you pay for.

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:58.364
There are tradeoffs associated with buying an HP versus a Macbook.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:01.022
The specs are not the computer.

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:07.136
I would argue that the amortized price of a Mac is probably about the same as a PC (or better).

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:13.150
They’re built to last (even if Apple forces you to buy a new one every year or face inferiority).

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.045
I’ve gone through too many Dell, HP and Toshiba laptops whose hinges explode.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:21.582
You can’t use a laptop after the hinge explodes.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:29.194
I haven’t had a Macbook explode yet (though the plastic did start coming off; it won’t happen on my aluminum Macbook Pro).

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:33.210
Dell is trying to get into the premium PC market, which is great.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.188
But that sorta negates the price argument.

00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:43.081
In this economy it’s smart to play the price card, and people pay more attention to upfront costs than maintenance costs.

00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:53.831
Also, it’s not the best idea to try and sell your product by having a “real” person shop for PCs when the person turns out to be a professional (SAG) actress .

00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:58.086
It makes it seem more staged; this definitely is not a Pepsi Challenge.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:01:59.625
But hey, whatever.

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:02.602
I think MS got their point across.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:06.059
Plus I forgive Lauren because she’s way cute!

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.395
I just hope her back can handle lugging around a 17″ computer.

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:16.189
Personally, I would advertise netbooks since they’re super cheap and Apple doesn’t have an equivalent, yet.
