University of Michigan Internship Fair ’08

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.140
Published on January 22, 2008.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.060
So I headed on down to the internship fair today happening at the Union.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.580
First thing that I noticed was that everyone was wearing suits!

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.560
My opinion on suits is that I hope I’ll never work anywhere that requires one, except for maybe at a company formal party or something.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.900
I guess it’s pretty standard attire for an internship fair, but I think distinguishing yourself is important too.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.320
Everyone looks the same in a suit.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.660
Luckily, I distinguished myself as the idiot who didn’t bring a suit.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.860
Mostly I just wandered around looking all the companies.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.960
Quite a few had really long lines just to talk to a recruiter.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.060
The place was packed, too.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.680
There were probably a few hundred people in any given room.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.080
I talked to some people from Liberty Mutual.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.060
The guy was laid back and pretty cool.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.200
He told me to check their website for any openings, and I got a pen and a weird bendy thing (it’s like, a blue bendy stick).

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.800
I also checked out this local web development company called Enlighten .

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.980
They were laid back as well.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.120
I talked to them a bit about web development and they gave me some cool magnetic thinking putty.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.340
I played with it.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.960
It’s sorta magnetic, but not highly magnetic.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.380
Like you wouldn’t replace an industrial strength electromagnet with it or anything.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.300
Most of my social interactions went pretty smoothly, I must say.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.480
There was one that I could probably call the worst of the year so far.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.460
I went up to the Macy’s corner and some guy said something and stuck out his hand.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.480
Now, I know when a person wants to shake my hand, I’m not an idiot.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.660
But I didn’t hear what he said, and I thought he said something like, “name?”

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.720
So I was like, “Hung,” and I pointed to my name tag.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.900
Then he said something else I couldn’t hear, so I said it louder and pointed more furiously, “HUNG!”

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.360
I thought he wanted to take something, instead of shaking my hand.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.420
Anyway, I finally shook his hand.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.020
Then, I asked if there were any engineering type jobs at Macy’s.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.200
He said that no, there were only management type jobs.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.660
I guess our interaction could’ve just ended there.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.000
But then I noticed something.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.120
Standing right behind the guy was a larger version of the guy.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.620
It was him, but bigger, and printed out on a large piece of paper.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.900
“Is… that… you?”

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.800
I slowly asked with furrowed brow.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.860
“THAT’S YOU!” And indeed, it was him on the promotional banner.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.080
He said it was taken a year or so ago.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.980
Without thinking, I said something like, “Could you stand next to it and do the same pose!?”

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.760
I think he was starting to get tired of my shenanigans.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.820
He actually contemplated it before not doing it.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.120
Then he suggested I leave by saying something like, “well, good luck in your internship search!”

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.460
I took the hint, but not before asking for a bouncy Macy’s ball.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.980
It glows when you bounce it.
