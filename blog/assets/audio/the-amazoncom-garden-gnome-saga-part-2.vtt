Amazon.com is apparently in possession of a number of Garden Gnomes that it seriously needs to offload quickly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.400
Because they mentioned them again on their homepage:

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.560
I can see how you might buy a female Mighican Gnome cheerleader when you buy the male Michigan Gnome, but WTF?

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.500
6% buy an Ohio State Gnome with the Michigan one!?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.560
Are they trying to cover their bases or something?

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.620
Honestly, what business does an Ohio State Gnome have being on the same lawn as a Michigan Gnome?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.760
Amazon.com, you disappoint me.
