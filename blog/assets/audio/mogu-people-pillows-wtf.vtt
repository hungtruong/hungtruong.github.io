Mogu People Pillows – WTF!?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on July 12, 2006.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.300
So I saw this thread on fatwallet about “Mogu People.”

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.160
Apparently they’re these squishy pillows in the form of people.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.660
Here’s the hippy company’s description:

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.260
Mogu People are reminders of what is best in all of us.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.360
Each one represents a positive human ideal or emotion.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:34.540
By their presence, Mogu People remind us to use our positive attributes to overcome challenges, reach our goals and follow our dreams.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.360
Keep them around to motivate you throughout the day or share them with others to empower their day.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:48.820
Friendship, love, encouragement, motivation, sympathy, apologies, birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, holidays…

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.420
I guess they were popular a few years ago, but I never heard of them.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.760
They seem to be really cheap now.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.740
Anyway, one of them really creeps me out.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.080
The Success one:

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.400
Seriously, it looks like an alien!

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.180
I can imagine waking up, seeing this next to me, and flipping out (and killing people)!
