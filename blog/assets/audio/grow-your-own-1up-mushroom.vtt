Grow Your Own 1up Mushroom!

Thinkgeek.com is selling what appears to be a real life 1up mushroom !

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.920
They provide a pipe, a spore, and some mushroom “food solution.”

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.160
All you do is add potting soil to the green sewer-pipe-shaped flower pot, and push the spores deep into it.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:30.180
Soak the soil with water using the dropper, add a squirt of the food solution, and then it’s off to a dark location for a few weeks.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.420
A still unanswered question remains: What happens if you eat it?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.680
I’m thinking either you’ll die instantly, or grow to enormous proportions (in your mind) and then die.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.540
I smell an impending lawsuit will happen when a kid decides to eat the mushroom (thinking he’s now got an extra life) and jumps off a cliff.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.380
Even without eternal life-giving properties, I want this.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.280
Bad. I’ve already ordered 2 for myself.
