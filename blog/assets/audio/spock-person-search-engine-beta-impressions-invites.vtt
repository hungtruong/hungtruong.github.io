Spock – Person Search Engine Beta Impressions + Invites

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on June 20, 2007.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.740
So I got a Spock invite from Jessica Mah and I just started trying it out today.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.280
It’s a search engine specifically designed to find people.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.500
So you type in a name, or a tag, or some other query and you’re supposed to get people as results.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.260
The Spock about page says:

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.300
Spock is the online leader in personal search, helping users find and discover people.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.560
With over one hundred million people already indexed and millions added every day, Spock is building the broadest and deepest people specific search engine.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.320
And that’s about all it says.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.900
Pretty sparse. I don’t even know what their actual purpose is.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.360
Is Spock for helping people stalk others?

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.620
Myspace is better for that.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.440
Is it for building business connections?

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.060
LinkedIn is better.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.120
Social networking? Either Facebook or LinkedIn, depending on how you’re networking.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.040
For more famous people, Spock shows a decent amount of aggregated info.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.580
Like for Eddie Murphy, you get tags, photos, and links to imdb and whatnot.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.080
For less famous people, all you get is the info that’s already available from whatever site the info was scraped from.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.160
Most peoples’ info is scraped from sources like LinkedIn or Myspace.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.260
This doesn’t really add anything useful, since you could just find those profiles on the respective sites.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.040
For example, let’s say that you want to find me on Spock.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.540
You’ll type in my name, and you’ll be presented with a bunch of Hung Truongs.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.400
You probably know something about me, so you’ll use the info that Spock has to figure out which Hung Truong is me.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.380
But since you know that much about me already, chances are, Spock won’t be telling you anything you don’t already know about me… Useless.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.300
There are already many sources to gather information about people online.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.840
Spock just aggregates this stuff and doesn’t actually add any value to the information.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.500
In addition, there’s probably all sorts of privacy issues that need to be dealt with if Spock gets to the open beta phase.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.320
Google does a good job of removing sensitive personal info if people request it.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.660
Spock might not be so kind.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.940
The most interesting thing I found while looking around at Spock was the $50,000 Spock Challenge .

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.640
Basically, Spock is holding a contest to get developers to solve the problem of Entity Resolution and Extraction.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.940
EG how do you know a page is about Michael Jackson the pop singer vs the football player.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.120
I’m pretty sure the answer involves Bayesian statistical analysis.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.780
But I’m not about to spend my time to solve a problem for a startup that I don’t believe in.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.660
Oh, I have 101 invites to try out Spock.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.880
So if you want one, leave a comment and I’ll email it to you.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.500
If I get around to it!
