Okay, faithful reader(s), you gotta help me make a decision.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.320
I have stupid classes this semester that start at stupid times, and I hate resetting my alarm clock every damn night.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.700
I was looking for an alarm clock that you could set for every weekday, and apparently one just came out called the Neverlate 7-day alarm clock .

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.680
It looks pretty awesome, and it’s $30 to avoid resetting that damn alarm every damn night.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.380
The only thing is, it just came out, so there’s no reviews, and it’s American made, which means it’ll probably break before a week has actually passed.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.120
Well, I think I might get it anyway, but what do you, my reader(s) think?
