IBM ThinkPad W700DS: DUAL SCREENS!?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.940
Published on December 20, 2008.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.380
So… IBM is making a ThinkPad with a screen, AND ANOTHER SCREEN INSIDE OF IT!

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.780
While the extra resolution might be kinda handy, I think it’s a bit much to put this on a notebook.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.160
Plus check out the thickness of the border between the screens.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.740
Definitely not very pretty.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.320
If they were designing the extra screen specifically for this device, couldn’t they have integrated it a bit better?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.120
Also, I think this is a hoax, even if it shows up on the IBM website.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.940
I won’t believe it until I see it in person!
