Sonny Stitt: Just In Case You Forgot How Bad He Really Was

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.980
Published on November 23, 2008.

If you ask almost anyone about Sonny Stitt, they’ll probably tell you he was really bad.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.080
Like, in a good way.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.180
But occasionally, some people will forget.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.760
In case of this rare occurrence, there’s a cd that’s appropriately named: “ Sonny Stitt: Just In Case You Forgot How Bad He Really Was .”

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.320
I just got it from the AADL.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.260
Not because I forgot, but because I happen to like Sonny Stitt.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.520
The songs are all pretty good.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.900
I think it’s parts of a live set that he did a while back.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.840
Stitt is just really freakin’ good, and not as repetitive as some people (Dexter Gordon, I’m looking at you!).

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.640
My favorite part of this album is probably the cover art.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.660
Seriously, I think they looked through all pictures of Sonny Stitt and found the one where he looked baddest.
