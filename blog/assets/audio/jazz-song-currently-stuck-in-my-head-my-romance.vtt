Jazz Song Currently Stuck In My Head: My Romance

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.900
Published on September 12, 2006.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.660
So every once in a while, a jazz standard just gets stuck in my head and I have to listen to every version of it ever.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.520
Right now, that song is “My Romance” by those Rodgers and Hart guys. Some background:

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.640
So after hearing of the death of Maynard Ferguson, I decided to listen to some of his music.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.980
Y’know, like pay tribute or something (even though I downloaded the music! Sorry Maynard!).

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.200
I put “ Swingin’ For Schuur ” in my car, and when I got to “My Romance” I was like, “yeah!”

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.640
I’d heard the song before, but sometimes these things need words for the whole package to click.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.100
I like memorizing words to standards for phrasing issues as well as trivia issues.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.040
One of the things I like about the song is that it’s totally self aware.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.980
Like it’s referencing other love songs that have sappy stuff in ‘em.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.840
Check out the lyrics:

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:26.280
My Romance Rodgers & Hart My romance doesn’t have to have a moon in the sky My romance doesn’t need a blue lagoon standing by No month of may No twinkling stars No hideaway No soft guitar My romance doesn’t need a castle rising in Spain Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain Wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dreams come true My romance doesn’t need a thing but you

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.760
If I ever sing this song in a karaoke setting or something, I want to replace “soft guitar” with “girl from mars.”

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.860
That’ll be so awesome!

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.900
The Maynard version is actually a pretty cool arrangement.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.800
The Bill Evans one is also really good.
