4 Reasons Why The Apple iPhone Will Fail

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.540
Published on January 09, 2007.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.940
The focus of today’s Macworld 2007 was definitely the iPhone.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.840
While general consensus is that the iPhone is the next killer app, I still have my doubts.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.460
Here are 4 reasons why the Apple iPhone will fail:

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.980
1. Public Acceptance:

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.580
The average person doesn’t even use the WAP browser on their phone, let alone any full blown OSX apps!

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.320
What people want in a mobile phone is a phone; they don’t need all of these extras.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.060
Extra software just makes it more difficult to perform the main function of the phone: to make phone calls.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.220
2. Price:

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:53.860
The price of the iPhone was announced at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB with a 2 year contract.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.080
Right now, you can get a T-Mobile MDA smartphone for $0 after rebate.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.500
The mass market is not willing to pay this much for a phone.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500
3. Copyright and Regulations:

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.180
There already is an iPhone out.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.280
It’s the Linksys Wireless-G Skype iPhone .

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.940
I hope Apple has a lot of money or lawyers to acquire the rights to the name.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.460
Pair this with the fact that the iPhone doesn’t have FCC approval and we might never see the iPhone get to market.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.680
How did Steve make all of those phone calls anyway?

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.000
4. Battery Life:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.240
The iPhone runs OSX!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.260
This is great for a laptop or a desktop computer, but does a phone really need OSX?

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.160
The battery life was announced as 5 hours of talk time, browsing, or video.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.620
Basically, 5 hours of active use.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.480
What happens after that?

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.460
Your phone is dead and no one can call you.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.100
People are not going to use the iPhone’s features for fear of losing their connectivity when the battery runs out.
