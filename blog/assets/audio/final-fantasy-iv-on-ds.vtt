Final Fantasy IV? On DS!?

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.860
Published on April 13, 2008.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.700
So I haven’t really been paying much attention to video game news since I started grad school.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.520
Not enough time for video games!

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.420
BUT, on a cursory stroll to Kotaku, I found out that Final Fantasy IV for DS is on its way for this Summer.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.140
Wait, FFIV for DS?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.640
Apparently it’s already out in Japan.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.460
That’s how behind on video game news I am.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.560
Perhaps it’s good that I don’t follow this stuff, though, because I’m not one to really like waiting for stuff anyway.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.860
There’s also a bunch of other neat Square games on DS like Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings and Crystal Chronicles.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.760
WTF? How’d I miss this stuff!?

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.640
Final Fantasy IV (I want to say Final Fantasy II) was my first FF game, so it’s sort of near and dear to my heart.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.660
I just rediscovered my Nintendo DS, and my unfinished copy of Final Fantasy IV Advance!

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.720
So I played for a couple of hours this weekend.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.020
It’s kind of weird playing it now since I’m used to a lot of story being told in FF games.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.480
Like, Rydia comes back from the dead and all you get is a simple three sentence explanation.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.100
Come on Rydia!

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.720
We want details!

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.140
Also, is it wrong to think Rydia is hot since she starts out being a kid in the game, and through some weird game mechanics, gets to be super hot later on?

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.900
I must say, I’m a bit worried about the whole transition from old school game to DS 3D treatment.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.320
I played Final Fantasy III on DS and it was a bit disappointing.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.820
My main beef with these conversions is that they screw up the game mechanics.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.960
All of sudden you get the same number of random encounters, but there’s a cost of a few seconds because of fancy panning before the battle and the victory screen after the battle.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.020
Everything seems so snappy on the old school version of FFIV that I’m playing right now.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.000
Except for those damn vampire bats and their drain attack, whose animation takes FOR-EV-ER!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.680
Man, I sure do sound like a cranky old school gamer.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.180
I’ve been wanting to finish FFXII, but I think the time requirements on that one are a bit higher than FFIV.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.600
The whole dash thing they built into the game has made it play a lot faster.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.620
I remember when I played the original, I rented it for the weekend.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.200
So each weekend I would start the game on Friday, and by Sunday when we had to return it I had gotten to the underworld part, basically where you get Edge.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.180
Then the next weekend I’d just start over again.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.640
How sad, right!

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.420
But it’s left me with pretty photographic memory of what happens at each step of FFIV.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.840
Right now I’m pretty damn far and I have only 9 hours on the game!

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.740
So hopefully the conversion to DS doesn’t slow things down insanely.
