Like a good data nerd, I downloaded the list of publicly available Facebook names , dumped into text files.

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:16.585
I was trying to figure out a neat way to use them.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:24.837
It’s always weird when people have the same first and last names, so I wrote a quick regex to find people with names like “John John” and “Laura Laura.”

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:28.853
I used /^([a-z]+) \1$/ , but maybe there’s a better one.

00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:31.670
I think mine left out the middle names.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.866
Apparently there are a lot of people with the same first and last name.

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.403
14,495 in my list, to be exact.

00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:43.739
But that’s out of a 100 million or so (I only did unique names).

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.396
Here’s the list for anyone who might care.

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:52.011
I’m trying to figure out a more useful application for this dataset. Any ideas?
