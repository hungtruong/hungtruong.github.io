Awesome Choose Your Own Adventure Photoshopping!

Published on March 01, 2006.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.300
This is semi-old, but I saw it at boingboing today, so hey!

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.240
Over at somethingawful , there’s a bunch of covers for Choose Your Own Adventure Books that didn’t quite make it.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.660
Most of these are incredibly awesome.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.940
Whenever I read those books, I’d always keep a finger on the last page where it branched out, just in case I died.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.880
This didn’t always work, because sometimes you’d die no matter which path you took. Stupid books!

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.080
I think there’s still a few of these books lying around my house.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.620
I’ll have to find them and see if I can do any better now.
