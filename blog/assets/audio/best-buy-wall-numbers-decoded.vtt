Best Buy Wall Numbers: Decoded!

Over at Best Buy, there’s usually some random numbers that are displayed on the wall without any kind of explanation.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.280
Someone actually went to the trouble of interrogating the workers at Best Buy until they exposed the secrets of the numbers!

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.640
The answers are over at Cabel’s Blog LOL :

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.560
Seeking meaning, I started occasionally asking “so, uh, what are those numbers, anyway?” when I checked out.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.700
Usually, I got the shrug-and-sigh double-punch.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.760
But sometimes, I got an interesting answer.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.980
And, eventually, it came together, helped tremendously by a conveniently annotated store â€” as well as some serious Googling.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.940
I always thought they were something like the McDonalds signs that said “Over 1000 billion served” that just counted the number of customers.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.600
Apparently they’re more evil than that.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.140
And by evil, I mean crazy replacement plan evil!
