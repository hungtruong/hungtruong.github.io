New Super Mario Bros. Website Up!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.460
Published on April 25, 2006.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.860
So the New Super Mario Bros.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.720
Website is up!

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.540
They haven’t got that much content, but they do have some wallpapers and a video.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.920
The video shows some of the new powerups in the game.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:29.940
Looks like there’ll be a super giant mushroom that makes Mario kick all kinds of ass, and a mushroom that shrinks Mario so he can jump off walls and walk on water. Pretty sweet!

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.300
I seriously think they need to bring back some of the old powerups.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.600
Doesn’t anyone else miss the tanooki Mario?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.780
Or frogman Mario?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.040
Or Hammer brother Mario!?

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.580
Or the giant boot!?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.040
Seriously, those were the coolest powerups ever!

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.020
[/end Nintendo fanboy rant].

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.940
The New Super Mario Bros. for Nintendo DS comes out on May 15th.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.080
I’d suggest pre-ordering it , because, seriously, it’s gonna sell out!
