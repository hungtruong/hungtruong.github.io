After Life

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.780
Published on July 27, 2008.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.540
After Life (also called “Wonderful Life” in Japanese) is a film about what happens when you die.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.400
I’ve been wanting to watch this movie recently because a few people close to me have passed away in the last year.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.460
I was originally introduced to this film a few years ago in Japanese class by a classmate who was a philosophy grad student.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.920
After Life has a somewhat positive view on the afterlife, so I thought it’d be nice to watch.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.440
The film’s afterlife is actually really similar to the world as we know it.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.340
Seasons change, electricity goes out and people get cold when it snows.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:49.360
The difference is that new visitors to the afterlife have a week to choose their most precious (大切な!) memory to immortalize in film form.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.980
Apparently they’ll watch their memory and then go on to yet another afterlife where they keep only that memory with them.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.900
The idea is both liberating and excruciating at the same time.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.560
You can forget all the bad things that happened in life and cling onto one great memory.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.100
But you also have to leave all of your life’s work and focus on the one most important moment of your life.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.860
The film works in sort of a pseudo-documentary/narrative mode where the dead counselors help the newly departed choose their memories.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.200
What follows is a candid look at the lives of 10 or so people.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.620
Some won’t stop talking about their womanizing ways while others think it would be cool to choose Splash Mountain.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.560
Apparently a lot of high school girls pick Splash Mountain.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.920
In the midst of all this, there’s also a plotline concerning the relationship between two of the counselors.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.820
It turns out the counselors are dead, too.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.960
They’re all people who weren’t able to choose a memory.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.260
There’s a love story of sorts going on between them which kind of begs the question: why doesn’t everyone just choose to stay in the limbo afterlife instead of making a movie memory?

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.920
They could literally live forever.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.660
Maybe people living in the limbo eventually fall out of love or get bored and decide to end it?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.960
I could imagine a number of Hamlet-style soliloquies proposing “to choose or not to choose?”

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.440
One of the recently dead, a young punk, starts messing with the counselors.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.340
He asks if he can use a dream as his memory, or even just make stuff up.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.640
He’s sort of the voice of reason in the movie.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.060
He asks the questions that I’d ask and prys much more than the other deceased.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.600
While watching I realized that the actor was also Morita in Honey & Clover , another Japanese movie I recently watched.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.820
Apparently he’s also in Casshern!

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.300
After all of the dead people choose their memories, the counselors get to work making their memories into mini-movies.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.920
After Life works because of its absolute earnestness.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.980
It really seems like a true documentary where these people are choosing their ultimate fates.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:02.120
They seem completely genuine when they’re describing the happiest moments of their lives and genuinely happy to see those moments recreated on set with actors portraying them.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.340
It probably helps that the director did a lot of actual documentaries before working on this movie.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.580
After Life is a great movie because it successfully suspends disbelief.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.840
For the 118 minutes of the film, I’m convinced that when you die, you make a movie about your life, watch it, and relive that memory forever.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.220
That alone is wonderful, given our uncertainty of the afterlife while we’re still living.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.260
So yeah, that’s what I have to say about After Life.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.480
It’s quirky, funny, thoughtful and genuine.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.340
I really dig it.
