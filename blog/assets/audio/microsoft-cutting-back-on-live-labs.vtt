Microsoft Cutting Back on Live Labs!

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:05.975
Published on April 10, 2009.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:13.768
I just read some bad news that Microsoft is cutting back on its Live Labs group due to the “economy.”

00:00:14.768 --> 00:00:20.841
Microsoft spokeswoman Stacy Drake McCredy said the economy had forced the company to rethink the group’s mission.

00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:36.766
The death of Live Labs as it has existed, combined with Google’s decision to cut some of its more experimental products, raises the question of whether these kind of futuristic initiatives are falling out of fashion among leading internet companies, or are just a victim of this recession.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:45.997
This saddens me because I got really excited after reading an article in Fast Company about Gary Flake’s Live Labs and how innovative it was going to be.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:54.009
It seemed like a step in the right direction for a company that has a reputation for being boring (see John Hodgman in the Apple commercials).

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:57.007
Microsoft has a ton of money.

00:00:57.507 --> 00:00:59.984
They should be spending it on research and development.

00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:07.436
The article mentions that Google is also cutting back on spending on 20% projects and killing off many of its labs projects.

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:11.772
This is a situation where Microsoft shouldn’t be following Google’s lead.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:20.823
Instead of having a knee jerk reaction to try and save more money, they should be willing to take at least a few risks with some opportunity for a high return on investment.

00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:27.636
I’m really sick of seeing companies rationalize stupid behavior by invoking the “economy” as the reason.

00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:35.509
Perhaps, as the actual Live Labs Blog indicates , this is a move to focus the projects rather than spread themselves too thin.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:43.361
I’m not quite sure I buy this explanation, even as I notice that many Microsoft Live products seem under-promoted and downright bad.

00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:48.096
Live Mesh stinks compared to Dropbox, a competing startup.

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:53.950
Inexplicably, Live Mesh does not share its storage capacity with another Live product, Sky Drive .

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.925
Why one of these services hasn’t made the other obsolete is completely beyond me.

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:01.903
Bad management? Bad communication?

00:02:02.403 --> 00:02:04.081
Something else? All of the above?

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:08.677
It’s possible to focus on products and retain people to work on them.

00:02:09.177 --> 00:02:13.652
I was really excited about the potential for Live Labs.

00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:17.668
Now, it looks like they’ve been neutered and will be working on search.

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:22.163
Yes, search needs work, but why sacrifice Live Labs for it?

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:28.737
Hopefully there will still be a place in Microsoft where people can freely innovate and not worry about just the bottom line…
