Mucinex: The Booger Drug

00:00:03.338 --> 00:00:05.895
Published on February 17, 2009.

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:08.413
So I have a cold right now.

00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:13.388
I called my normal doctor’s office and apparently they don’t do urgent care type stuff.

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.566
But they do have a nurse!

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.423
So I talked to the nurse and she gave me a list of drugs to take.

00:00:19.923 --> 00:00:21.521
One of them was Mucinex.

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.918
Apparently this is some kind of miracle drug.

00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:31.971
It’s the one in the commercials that has a family of green boogers (or mucus?) living in a human’s chest.

00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:38.305
Then the person takes the Mucinex and the family of boogers is evicted, to put it nicely.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.202
Mucinex tears families apart.

00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:43.859
Families of the mucus variety.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.337
Anyway, I used it and it seems to be okay.

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:55.429
It didn’t work in the elaborately theatrical fashion as the commercials would have me believe, but I think I have less junk in my chest now than before.
