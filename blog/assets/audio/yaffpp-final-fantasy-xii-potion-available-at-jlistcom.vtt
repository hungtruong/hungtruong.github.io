Yeah, it’s yet another Final Fantasy XII Potion Post.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.840
This should be almost the last one, I promise!

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.740
Anyway, News on the street is that everyone’s favorite online wacky Japanese item store, Jlist.com has Final Fantasy XII Potions in stock!

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.040
Now, the price for the limited edition version is kinda high at $24.50, but the normal version is “only” $4.50.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.100
Yes, I know that’s still freaking expensive for a 120mL drink, but it’s Final Fantasy!!!

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.740
I think I may buy a few, depending on whether or not anyone wants to split shipping with my (my cousin will probably want a couple).

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.680
Shipping is $4.80 for one bottle, and it gets better (per bottle) if you buy in bulk.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.700
Final Fantasy XII Potion , getto!
