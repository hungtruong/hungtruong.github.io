Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value – Book Review

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:07.094
Published on February 02, 2011.

00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:15.126
I just recently finished reading a book, so I better write up a review so I can collect my free Pizza Hut Personal Pan Pizza !

00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:22.738
I read about Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value on Aaron Swartz’s 2010 Book Review (I’m trying to read as much as that dude does).

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:29.951
Pricing has always been pretty interesting to me, so I figured a book about pricing would be a good, quick non-fiction read.

00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:36.285
Ironically, I opted to pay zero price for the book, borrowing it from the library instead of buying it.

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:44.397
Previously, I read Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture , which also concerned pricing, but mostly in the super cheap range.

00:00:44.897 --> 00:00:48.653
Priceless takes more of a psychological stab at human behavior.

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:53.388
There are a few experiments that both books alluded to, like the Hershey’s kiss experiment.

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:59.322
Having read these two books (and the Freakonomics ones), I kind of think I should’ve been an economist.

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:04.638
Priceless starts out a bit slow by giving you a crash course in human psychology.

00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:11.131
Homo Economicus is described as a human who makes only rational decisions, and only the most rational.

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:16.186
As a model, HomoEco is probably only useful in lab situations.

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:23.878
As the book describes, human behavior is not only often irrational, but also very easy to manipulate.

00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:29.093
Priming and Anchoring are ways to change a person’s opinion on something before they’ve even seen it.

00:01:30.093 --> 00:01:31.611
The book gives this example.

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:36.666
Research subjects were asked which percentage of the UN is comprised of African nations.

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:41.242
Before that question, they were asked to give an over/under on a percentage.

00:01:41.742 --> 00:01:47.655
The percentage given was either really low (10%) or somewhat average (60%).

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:56.706
The difference in that first question, is the percentage of African nations in the UN above or below (10/60%) affected their guess of what it actually was.

00:01:57.206 --> 00:02:00.882
The scary thing is that this works with many things, including pricing.

00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:05.697
Another experiment involved real estate and a differing list prices.

00:02:06.197 --> 00:02:13.150
Subjects (both normal people and real estate agents) were given list prices of a home and were asked to give a reasonable bid.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.442
Even the real estate professionals were susceptible to the anchoring effect of the suggested prices, though to a lesser degree.

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:33.110
After giving a solid scientific basis for human irrationality (specifically regarding pricing), the book goes through many short examples where the these effects were either exploited or tested in slightly different contexts.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.444
It’s all pretty interesting stuff, especially to someone who feels they are above Jedi price tricks like me though I am probably not).

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:44.839
There are also a few methods described to try to ward against anchoring and priming.

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.577
One is to immediately set up an argument.

00:02:48.077 --> 00:02:55.908
If someone says “do you think this book is worth 26.99?” and you say “yes,” then immediately think of reasons why it might be worth less than that.

00:02:56.408 --> 00:03:00.724
This is also why you should always take a friend with you to the car dealership to argue with.

00:03:01.724 --> 00:03:04.520
Overall I thought the book was really interesting.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:14.530
If you can get past all of the cognitive science at the beginning (I might’ve found it boring because I had heard about most of it before), the second half of the book is a really quick and interesting read.
