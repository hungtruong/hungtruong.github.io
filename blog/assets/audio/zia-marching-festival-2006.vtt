Zia Marching Festival 2006!

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.980
Published on October 21, 2006.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.100
So today was Zia, the big marching festival of the year hosted by UNM.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.040
It was pretty fun, despite all the work and whatnot.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.460
This will most likely be my last one, since I’m gonna graduate in December.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.600
Not that I feel overly sentimental.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.380
I thought my last one was gonna be in 2002, but I ended up doing marching band this year on a whim.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.020
It was a pretty good end to a marching career.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.840
And by that, I mean the show was horrible.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.780
The music part was okay, but marching was crazy.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.160
First off, the hashes for the high school bands are about 4 steps away from our normal ones.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.220
This threw off pretty much every set.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.480
Next, the sun was shining directly on the grass, and I could barely even see where the lines were painted.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.440
That’s not all.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.900
For some reason, my throat got super dry, and by the end, I could barely play anything at all.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.280
Luckily this happened before I took my solo.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.560
There’s more! During the drum break (when all the difficult marching goes on), my shoelace got untied!

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.740
So I had to sorta hop around and I got out of step multiple times.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.640
I guess a flute girl (who will remain unnamed) got lost, and I collided with her after doing an about face.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.300
I think that’s all the bad stuff that happened.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.260
Honestly, I think it was probably the worst show I have ever marched in my marching band career.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.160
Not that it’s necessarily a bad thing.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.500
It was actually pretty fun.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.080
Since UNM doesn’t get judged on their own field, it’s not like I had to worry about having points deducted or anything.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.220
Word from some spectators is that we sounded fine.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.640
I seriously want to get a hold of the tape, so I can post it (and see the collision)!

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.540
Ah Zia, how I’ll miss you.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.980
Hinano, my friend from the podcast that I do, made up a comic about the event.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.720
That image up there is a panel from it.
