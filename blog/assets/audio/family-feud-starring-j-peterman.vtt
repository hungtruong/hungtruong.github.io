Family Feud – Starring J. Peterman!

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.020
Published on March 04, 2007.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.820
So lately, I’ve been watching Family Feud on TV.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.280
It’s only because all the other shows that are on at that time are either soap operas, or Anna Nicole Smith documentary shows.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.260
And by that, I mean gossip shows that only talk about Anna Nicole Smith.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
For some reason, I thought that Louie Anderson was still hosting Family Feud.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.240
He’s kind of depressing and scary, so that’s why I have a bad image of Family Feud.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.820
Well, they finally kicked out Louie Anderson (probably a long time ago) and now John O’ Hurley is hosting!

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.640
Who is John O’ Hurley, you ask?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.340
I dunno, but he played J. Peterman on Seinfeld!

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.740
It’s kind of weird seeing a character actor like him hosting Family Feud.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.720
Like there was a contestant named “Elaine” and when he said “come up, Elaine” I had weird Seinfeld flashbacks!

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.780
He even said it in J. Peterman’s voice!

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.240
I guess technically it’s his actual voice, but still.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.760
Oh, and speaking of Family Feud, I really hate how they show the answers at the end of each round.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.380
Like they have the audience read them to us slowly as if we’re blabbering, illiterate idiots.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.840
I suppose most people who watch Family Feud are, though.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.780
(Not me, of course)

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.260
Also, where do they find these families?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.040
Can people be so out of touch with reality that they think funerals are a good time to have a family portrait taken?

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.780
Or that Wal-Marts exist in malls!?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.800
Who are these people!?
