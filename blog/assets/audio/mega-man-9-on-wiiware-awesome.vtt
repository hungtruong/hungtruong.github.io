Mega Man 9 on WiiWare. AWESOME

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.540
Published on July 10, 2008.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.820
So I read that Mega Man 9 is coming out on WiiWare.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.240
Cool. But then I realized it was Mega Man 9 and not, say, Mega Man X or Mega Man Battle Network.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.340
It’s MEGA MAN!

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.800
The old school one!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.440
I remember getting Mega Man 1 (still have it) for the NES after getting 3.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.100
I think the second one is probably still the best, what with Wood Man, Heat Man and Bubble Man.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.000
Geez, Bubble Man was so awesome!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.440
It’s amazing that Capcom is actually making a new Mega Man game with NES style graphics.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.580
I think the only reason this is possible is that digital distribution (Wii Shop channel, PS3 Store, Xbox Live) makes it extremely cheap to distribute.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.880
I imagine an 8-bit game costs less to develop than, say, Grand Theft Auto 4.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.140
So Capcom should be able to make its money back through nostalgic fans.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.140
I, for one, will probably be getting it.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.160
Depending on my level of nostalgia vs. the price of the thing.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.140
I remember the NES Mega Man series kind of jumping the shark anyway, when they started running out of “Men” to use.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.360
Seriously, Pharaoh Man? CLOWN MAN!?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.520
I hope the bosses are a bit more original and kickass this time around.
