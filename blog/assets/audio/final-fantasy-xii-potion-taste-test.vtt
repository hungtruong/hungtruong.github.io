Final Fantasy XII Potion Taste Test!

First off, apologies for turning this into the Final Fantasy XII Potion blog.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.280
I’m just really obsessed with it at the time being.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.760
Kotaku has done a taste test of the new Final Fantasy XII Potion drink!

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.660
The verdict? It tastes like medicine.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.880
Of course! It’s a healing potion, so it is medicine!

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.100
No word on whether any hit points were recovered.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.620
I still don’t feel like importing this drink for $12.50 + shipping.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.640
Maybe they’ll release it stateside along with Final Fantasy XII?
