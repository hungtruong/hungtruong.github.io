So while I was on Youtube looking for actual karaoke videos (like for me to sing along), I found these videos of two asian guys playing Karaoke Revolution .

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.800
The guy on the left is pretty good, and the guy on the right is not quite as good…

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.520
There’s something to be said about hearing two Asian guys singing endless love to each other… And California Dreamin’ is just terrible!

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.100
They seriously need to switch parts.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.780
Anyway, these videos are the real reason why Youtube is freakin’ popular, so I thought I’d share the wealth:

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.460
Greatest Love of All

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.000
Endless Love

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.860
California Dreamin’

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.160
Believe it or not, these videos really make me want to run out and get Karaoke Revolution .

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.060
They have “I Believe in a Thing Called Love”?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.440
I must get it.
