Advance Wars: Days of Ruin

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.380
Published on May 03, 2008.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.380
I got Advance Wars: Days of Ruin from Amazon.com yesterday because it was on sale for like $16.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.680
I’d played Advance Wars 2 and it was pretty cool, and I skipped Advance Wars Dual Strike.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.520
One thing that kind of seemed weird to me for the Advance Wars games was that the fighting always seemed unmotivated.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.820
Like here’s some random countries, let’s go to war!

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.320
Also, the cartoony quality of the graphics led to some weird cognitive dissonance as I led my cute dudes with their tanks off to die in gruesome battle.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.960
Days of Ruin sort of fixes this by making the graphics more gritty and changing the setting to a post-apocalyptic world.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.220
So everyone is fighting for food and survival instead of just for the hell of it.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.480
Unfortunately, the setting is not like Mad Max, where everyone is hoarding hockey pads and crossbows and gas.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.900
Seriously, you have factories that make tanks, but you can’t make food!?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.840
Get your priorities straight!!!

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.080
So far, it’s been pretty fun, but the challenge level just seems really low.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.660
I think I probably just need to complete some more missions and get further in the game.
