Goin’ To Chicago (Interview with Orbitz)

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.780

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.860
I’m going to Chicago this Thursay and Friday for an interview with orbitz.com.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.880
With the help of some friends (and Google Maps) I compiled a map of stuff I should see while I’m there.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.860
The timing might be kinda tight since I also have to interview (the main reason I’m there) but hopefully I can do things like:

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.380
See the mirror blob thing

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.140
Eat some pizza (Giordano’s seems to be the most popular choice)

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.140
Go up to the top (or almost the top) of the John Hancock building

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.180
Eat some popcorn

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.980
Go to the Apple Store (low priority but I need to do some name dropping or something)

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.220
This is my first time in Chicago (well, I drove through once to get to Michigan but didn’t stop) so it should be interesting.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.200
I wonder if Obama is still hanging around.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.500
Maybe I can do the fist bump with him if I run into him…
