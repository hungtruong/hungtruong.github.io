The Last Lecture – Book Review

00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:06.295
Published on January 05, 2010.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:16.485
I grabbed the audio version of The Last Lecture onto my iPhone a while back for a long car trip, but in typical Hung Truong fashion I didn’t take advantage of my over-preparedness.

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:25.456
Recently I’ve been riding the bus a lot, and I recently took a series of long flights, so I had a chance to listen to the whole book over a span of a few weeks.

00:00:26.456 --> 00:00:29.413
Randy Pausch’s story is pretty interesting.

00:00:29.913 --> 00:00:36.945
He was a professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer – not the most survivable.

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:43.359
His diagnosis gave him 3-6 months, and for his “Last Lecture” he showed people how to live their childhood dreams.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.936
The video really caught on!

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:50.352
I watched it quite a while ago and it really is incredibly inspiring.

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:52.210
You can see it here .

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.005
The Last Lecture: The Book, goes into further detail on things that Pausch touched upon during the lecture.

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:05.138
It’s a more thought-out version that makes sense as a book, since a four or five-hour lecture might be a bit rough on the audience.

00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:09.553
Randy’s main points are that if you try hard enough, you can get what you want.

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:11.811
Persistence pays off.

00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:16.707
Enabling others to succeed is often more rewarding than serving yourself.

00:01:17.207 --> 00:01:21.602
Throughout his life, Randy got to do all sorts of stuff that he dreamed about since he was a kid.

00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:28.196
Maybe it’s a product of having a one-sided view of Randy’s life, but it seems like this dude is a total saint!

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:30.773
He even jokes about it in the book.

00:01:31.273 --> 00:01:36.148
I personally think that he probably was a really awesome person who deserved everything that he worked for.

00:01:36.648 --> 00:01:41.203
While it really is sad that he died, he crammed in a bunch of cool stuff in his life!

00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:48.575
To his credit, he says in his book that the thing that bothered him the most was that his kids wouldn’t be able to grow up with him as a presence.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:54.270
It’s really wonderful that some people can be so selfless, even when they have a very limited time limit.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.185
I think we all need a reminder sometimes that our time is limited.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.083
In some cases, it can be extremely short .

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:10.494
One thing that I have struggled with, given the reminders I have had that life is short, is that I really get antsy when I don’t feel like I’m moving forward.

00:02:10.994 --> 00:02:18.826
I can appreciate that patience is a virtue, but I also think that being proactive is one of the best things a person can do for him/herself.

00:02:19.826 --> 00:02:27.897
I often think of my lifespan as a progress bar (think a file transfer dialog box or something) that is always moving towards 100%.

00:02:28.397 --> 00:02:32.233
But you can’t see how close you are to 100% (unless you’re Randy).

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:35.370
So how much of my life would I like to spend unhappy?

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.304
1%? That’s more than a year, if you assume <100 year lifespan.

00:02:41.804 --> 00:02:44.361
Oh, I guess I’m not really reviewing this book anymore, am I?

00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:49.256
One thing I noticed about the audiobook version is that it’s not Randy reading the book to you.

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:54.471
This makes sense since I’m sure Randy would have rather spent the studio time doing stuff with his family.

00:02:54.971 --> 00:03:00.165
But it’s also kind of weird listening to this dude who isn’t Randy talk about all of his awesome life experiences.

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:06.579
Maybe they could’ve just recorded all the possible syllables Randy could make, then piece them into words and sentences?

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.513
Nah. Anyway, The Last Lecture is a really nice companion to the actual last lecture.

00:03:13.013 --> 00:03:14.771
It puts things into perspective.

00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:17.988
I personally strive to make the most out of every day.

00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:21.684
I hope I have a lot of quality time left doing the things I love.

00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:25.061
But if I don’t, at least people will know I made the most of it!
