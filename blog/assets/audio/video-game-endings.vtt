Over at Game Revolution, there’s some old school video game endings .

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.320
Now, back in my day, video games were hard.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.500
Really freakin’ hard!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.560
They weren’t as long as today’s game, and they didn’t have the cutscenes, but they had the power to make a controller fly across the room.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.140
Getting to a game ending was like the payoff for getting grey hairs at the age of ten.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.800
That’s why this website is so bitchin’!

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.020
Spare your blood pressure and check out all the game endings without the work! Awesome!
