For some reason I decided to look at my spam in Gmail and this was the first spam message:

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:21.560
Apparently when he’s not rapping, Will Smith redesigns people’s websites out of the kindness of his heart (though I guess he also works it as a side business).

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.759
Oh my god.

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:32.650
I just realized I made an almost carbon copy of this post regarding George Lucas and spamming .

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.429
Am I that predictable!?
