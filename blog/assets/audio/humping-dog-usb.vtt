Humping Dog USB!

When I first saw pictures of the Humping Dog USB thing, I thought it was an ill-designed USB flash drive.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.320
Obviously people were laughing at it because it was dog shaped, and if you put it onto a laptop, it looked like the dog was humping it.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.780
I was wrong.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.860
The device is specifically designed to look like a dog humping a laptop.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.040
Moreover, it is mechanical.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.220
Yes, the dog physically humps the laptop when you “plug it in.”

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.960
The website (in Japanese) states, “Once you insert it, it doesn’t stop!”

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.560
I’m not even sure that the USB device has any memory, as the website says nothing about capacity.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.020
I think it’s just more of a desk toy than anything.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.520
It costs 998 yen, which is less than $10.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.160
I don’t know if the best part of the video is the mosaic censoring of the dog, or “Believe” by Cher playing in the background…
