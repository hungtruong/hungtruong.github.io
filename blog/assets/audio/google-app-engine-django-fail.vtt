Google App Engine + Django == FAIL

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.940
Published on April 08, 2008.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.820
Edit: Using the tutorial from this dude , I was able to get the Django “hey, you got the barebones working!” page working.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.200
I may have time to mess around with this more in a week or so.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.360
I just wasted an hour trying to get the Google App Engine and Django to work together on both my Mac and my PC.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.140
Both give failure errors when I try to run the server.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.700
Should I assume I’m a bad computer scientist?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.000
Or should I assume that Google needs to do more testing/documentation before releasing stuff?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.820
Granted, I haven’t used Django before, but it should really work if I follow the directions correctly (and I did, twice)!

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.740
I would consider learning the webapp framework, but I’d rather learn something I could use on a server other than Google’s.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.960
I’ve been meaning to learn Django for a while now.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.660
I had some high hopes that I’d be able to get something cool running in a short amount of time, but I guess not.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.580
People are saying this App Engine thing is a great competitor to Amazon’s ECC.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.200
Not quite yet.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:16.340
You can’t run any software you want on App Engine, you’re limited to using Python for now, and from my experience, App Engine seems a bit half-baked at this point.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.680
What about cron-jobs?

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.100
What about running scripts?

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.440
What about root access?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.100
I can’t see why Google didn’t just decide to copy Amazon and allow developers to upload a linux image or something.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.940
My initial impressions are disappointing.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.760
Maybe once the semester is over, they’ll have a more stable version of this available…
