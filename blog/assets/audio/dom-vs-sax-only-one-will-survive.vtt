DOM Vs. SAX: Only One Will Survive

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.060
So while working on iPhone stuff, we used a SAX parser to handle xml.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:21.400
I thought this was a wacky way of parsing stuff, and I prefer DOM since it is much easier to understand as it’s conveniently in tree form.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.720
Today, I tried parsing a 39mb xml file with Python’s minidom.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.980
Bad idea. It’s currently making my MacBook choke and it also made my desktop PC cry for memory.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.720
Apparently SAX is 1337 when it comes to memory efficiency while DOM is incredibly inefficient.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.900
Seriously, Python was taking more than 1gb of memory to parse a 39mb file!

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.400
Perhaps my actual use of the minidom stuff was incorrect, but either way, I’ll probably try doing stuff in SAX if the file happens to be even remotely big.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.360
Lesson learned!

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.120
Update: SAX totally pwned those large files.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.660
All 8 of them!

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.920
And in less than a minute!
