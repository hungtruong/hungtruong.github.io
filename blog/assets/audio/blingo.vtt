So Blingo is this search engine (it uses google’s search results) that gives you prizes for searching.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.880
That is, if you search at exactly the right time, you can get a prize like an iTunes gift certificate or a PSP or something.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.180
Only 10 searches count per day, so searching all day won’t get you any better odds.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.200
Still, I’m going to try it to see if I can win anything.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.060
You should too.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.880
And sign up as my friend, that way, if I win, you’ll get the same prize, and vice versa. Awesome, right?
