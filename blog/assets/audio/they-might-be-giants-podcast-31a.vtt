They Might Be Giants Podcast: 31A!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.860
Published on January 28, 2008.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.980
For those of you keeping track, I sorta like TMBG again.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.240
They’ve gained back my trust with their newest album and powerful live show .

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.120
Anyway, today is a new podcast day!

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.980
TMBG was pretty much doing podcasts before they existed (even before iPods existed!) via their dial a song service.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.880
So this is sort of an extension of that.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.180
Except the sound quality is much, much better.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.820
Of special note are some new versions of old songs!

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.240
According to the TMBG wiki , the songs were recorded at XM Studio, whatever that means.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.020
It’s pretty neat hearing new versions of Shadow Government, Withered Hope, and Mr. Me!

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.760
The turtle sounds thing is pretty funny too, mentioning the Fibonacci Sequence .

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.700
There’s also some songs about numbers that are no doubt directed towards turning children into fans of TMBG at an early age. Clever…

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.420
Anyway, I kind of want to split the podcast up into the individual songs and listen to them over and over and over.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.040
It’s that good!
