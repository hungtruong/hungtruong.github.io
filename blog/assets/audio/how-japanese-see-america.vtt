How Japanese See America

Over at Yukihime , there’s a scanned map from an old Sega Saturn RPG that was set in the United States. From Yukihime:

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:25.180
This map is basically what would happen if you got a bunch of Japanese guys in a room, got them drunk, and then asked them to draw what they could remember about America on a bar napkin.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.800
Hell, that’s probably how this game was originally designed.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.620
Anyhow, I feel the map speaks for itself .

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.460
This is really distressing.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:47.680
I’m assuming this is some kind of parody thing, but Chicago is some kind of mega fortress, Alaska has an ice palace, Montana seems to be some kind of Neko City, and Saint Paul has a giant one of those bird things that drink water!

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.180
Most of America also seems to be covered in impassable mountain terrain.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.920
At least they had a location from New Mexico: Carlsbad Caverns!

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.640
Also scary is the existence of Mexico, but not Canada…

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.720
As bad as this is, I have a feeling Americans could probably not do any better.
