Blingo, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways…

Remember how I was blogging about that Blingo thing?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.560
Well today I actually won a $10 for iTunes!

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.820
I was all, what the heck!?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.960
So anyway, I guess I read the rules wrong.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.260
If you sign up for blingo, I get your prize if you win, but not the other way around.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.840
Sorry if I seemed misleading.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.100
I was all happy for everyone who signed up as my friend too, but then I was all, oops, they don’t win.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.360
You should still sign up though, cause I want your prizes! Yeah!
