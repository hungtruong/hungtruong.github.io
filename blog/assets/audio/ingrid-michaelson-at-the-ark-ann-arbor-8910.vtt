00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.610
I went to see Ingrid Michaelson with my .

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.265
gf at The Ark in Ann Arbor on August 9th, 2010.

00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:21.800
This was the third time I’ve seen her in concert, which is the most times I’ve seen anyone in concert, I think.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.017
Besides the band I was in myself, which doesn’t count.

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:29.852
I had recently seen her and the band in Seattle in October last year .

00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:38.743
I was hoping there’d be a lot of new material, but for the most part it was a lot of songs from her latest two albums, Everybody and Be Okay / Girls and Boys .

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:42.520
She played one new song called “Parachute” that was catchy.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.915
As usual, Ingrid and the band came off as genuinely having a good time.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:57.205
I think it helped that this was a fan show (they pre-sold out to the fan email list) and they had been opening for a band so no one knew who they were for the past few shows.

00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:02.580
As with any live show, the best parts are when the band does something unexpected.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:20.819
In this show, they mixed in the chorus from Poker Face into Soldier (I think they might’ve done that last time, too), did a cover of Britney Spears’ Toxic as a last song (before they left for an encore) and also played a punky fast version of The Way I Am as their real last song (which they also played at normal speed earlier in the show).

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.216
Overall, It was a really fun show.

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:31.349
Ingrid and the band really have a good time, and it rubs off on the fans, especially in a small venue like The Ark.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.007
Hopefully a new album is on the way.

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:37.463
I’d like to hear more new material next time.
