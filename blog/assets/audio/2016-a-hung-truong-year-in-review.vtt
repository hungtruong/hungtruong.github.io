2016: A Hung Truong Year in Review

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:07.733
Published on December 31, 2016.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:13.927
It’s been a while since I wrote a year-in-review on this blog, let alone any blog post.

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:18.343
2016 was a big year though, so here’s some stuff I did.

00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:30.372
In January Emily and I moved from Ann Arbor, Michigan where we had been living for a few years (Emily since grad school and me since the last time I moved back from Chicago in like 2012) to Seattle, Washington.

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:36.785
I’ve loved Seattle ever since I moved here in 2009 to go work for Microsoft , and it’s great to be back!

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:42.479
I’m working for a coffee company in Seattle called Starbucks (yes, I get free coffee).

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.815
I get to work on their iOS app and make latte art in my spare time.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:48.594
Here are some highlights:

00:00:49.594 --> 00:01:00.702

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:24.999
For the first year that we’ve been here, Emily and I have been exploring the sights in Seattle, including a bunch of parks like Discovery Park, Volunteer Park (which has lots of cute baby ducks ) and Seward Park, among others.

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:33.970
With all the free coffee I’m getting, I’m also experimenting with different brew methods including Aeropress, cold brew, and most recently with a Kalita Wave .

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.843
In June I went to WWDC for the first time as an attendee and got to meet lots of other cool developers.

00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:47.937
I got a photo with Craig with the good hair who does the funny parts of the Apple keynotes.

00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:53.311
Next year I’m going to be attending a conference in the UK as a speaker, which I’m really excited about.

00:01:54.311 --> 00:02:00.944
Last year I got a new digital camera which I started using quite a bit to capture our hikes and other interesting moments.

00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:06.079
This year I upgraded from the Sony RX-100 to the Fujifilm X-T1 .

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:13.452
It’s been really fun learning more about photography as a hobby and reading about lenses and techniques to get cool photo captures.

00:02:13.952 --> 00:02:17.548
Here’s a few shots that I like, taken from this year:

00:02:18.548 --> 00:02:23.742
In September I bought a bunch of supplies and built a tiny solar powered charging system on my roof .

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:33.272
It was a fun proof of concept and I’m using it to charge some of my lower power devices, including an electric bike that I bought for my commute (when it’s not rainy).

00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:38.487
I’m guessing that it wouldn’t have enough juice yet to power an electric car, but that’s on my to do list.

00:02:39.487 --> 00:02:45.800
In October, Apple announced a new piece of hardware, so naturally I wrote a fart app for it .

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.157
That’s basically the noteworthy stuff that happened to me this year.

00:02:50.657 --> 00:02:54.173
Moving and getting used to Seattle is basically a full-time job.

00:02:54.673 --> 00:03:03.623
I’m also keeping myself busy with updating the house and automating it as much as possible using a Samsung SmartThings hub and various light switches, etc.

00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:18.589
Other random things I’ve been working on are experimenting with Instagram by using a copious number of tags in all of my posts, buying a pair of Snapchat Spectacles and experimenting with those, and cooking new recipes with the pressure cooker I just purchased from Amazon.

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:25.502
I’m looking forward to doing more stuff in 2017 and hopefully blogging about it more often as well.
