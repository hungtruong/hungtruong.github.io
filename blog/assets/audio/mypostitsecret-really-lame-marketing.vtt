MyPostItSecret – Really Lame Marketing

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.980
So while browsing myspace (yeah, I know…), I found some kind of link to a viral marketing site .

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.520
In it, you take a look into the room of a college bound girl who tells all of her darkest secrets.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.300
Unfortunately, they all have to do with Post-It products.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.740
Yes, post-it is trying to get teenagers to use their products.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.600
They’re using a model who sounds waaayyy too into post it notes:

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:41.600
“I have a rating system for friends. I put my friends’ phone numbers up on the wall with post-it specialty notes. The arrows point up or down depending on who’s on my list of favorites.”

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.440
Wait. This girl has friends!!??

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.720
This is probably the worst ad campaign I have ever witnessed.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.780
Does Post-it think they’re fooling anyone?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.880
Maybe their plan is to get publicity by having snarky bloggers write about how bad this is…
