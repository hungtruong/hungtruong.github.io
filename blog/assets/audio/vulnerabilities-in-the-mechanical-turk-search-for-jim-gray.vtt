Vulnerabilities In The Mechanical Turk Search For Jim Gray

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.820
Published on February 03, 2007.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.580
I just read about a really awesome use for Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk: finding missing people!

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.840
From the Mechanical Turk’s page:

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.360
On Sunday, January 28th, 2007, Jim Gray , a renowned computer scientist was reported missing at sea.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.380
As of Thursday, Feb. 1st, the US Coast Guard has called off the search, having found no trace of the boat or any of its emergency equipment.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.600
Follow the story here.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:45.820
Through the generous efforts of his friends, family, various communities and agencies, detailed satellite imagery has been made available for his last known whereabouts.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.880
You will be presented with 5 images.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:57.300
The task is to indicate any satellite images which contain any foreign objects in the water that may resemble Jim’s sailboat or parts of a boat.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.520
Jim’s sailboat will show up as a regular object with sharp edges, white or nearly white, about 10 pixels long and 4 pixels wide in the image.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.900
If in doubt, be conservative and mark the image.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.520
Marked images will be sent to a team of specialists who will determine if they contain information on the whereabouts of Jim Gray.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.000
While I think it’s a really nifty and commendable idea, it bothers me how vulnerable this system is from the way I understand it.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.060
It seems to me that once an image is marked as containing a sailboat-like object, it will be sent to others for investigation.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.400
If not, it will be discarded.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.560
In computer science, you’re trained to think as an adversary to the algorithm.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.940
While I’d hope there aren’t any people malicious enough to try and sabotage this system, it’s always worth considering the possibility.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.160
I’ve thought of a few vulnerabilities that the Mechanical Turk faces in the search for Jim Gray:

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.920
Vulnerability 1

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.560
The adversary marks each picture as not containing anything of interest, even if it does.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.340
In the case that an adversary finds the picture with the sailboat, he and he alone can invalidate it.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.720
The data is never considered and the search fails.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.120
I’m assuming a few things about the system.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.020
The biggest assumption is that each HIT will be viewed by only one person.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.760
The Mechanical Turk doesn’t specify this.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.260
If two people are assigned to each hit, the odds of this happening are lower.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.240
Though this system can still be defeated by two adversaries working in tandem.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.000
Vulnerability 2

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.440
The adversary marks each picture as being interesting.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.140
An overwhelming amount of data is sent to the “team of specialists” and we’re back to square one.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.560
We can’t just assume that all of the pictures flagged as interesting were not, because one could be useful.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.000
This kind of attack seems much more malicious to me.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.660
At best, you could invalidate all of the adversary’s HITs and reassign them.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.000
This could take precious time, though, since once a HIT is taken, it is locked from other users to attempt.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.680
Vulnerability 3

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.000
The adversary randomly marks non-interesting pictures interesting, and interesting pictures to be non-interesting.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.040
This is probably the most malicious and the hardest to detect.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.300
While the odds of finding an interesting picture to mark non-interesting would be low, it could happen.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.180
I can’t think of a way to combat this kind of attack, apart from having two users work on each HIT.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.520
Again, this could still be defeatable by two adversaries working together to dirty the results.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.640
Conclusion

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.240
Even with these vulnerabilities, I think the Mechanical Turk’s search for Jim Gray is an incredible idea.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.980
I sincerely hope that they do find him.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.200
It would be a great victory for everyone involved.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.860
Please do join in the search for Jim Gray.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.240
Please don’t follow any of the adversarial techniques I mentioned!

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:09.960
I just hope that the people behind the Mechanical Turk are aware of these vulnerabilities, and have come up with solutions (that are better than mine) to combat any kind of malicious use that could undermine the entire project.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:19.120
If you have any ideas to combat these vulnerabilities, or have any other ideas for vulnerabilities that I may have missed, please let me know in the comments.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.260
I’d be interested from a computer science sort of viewpoint.
