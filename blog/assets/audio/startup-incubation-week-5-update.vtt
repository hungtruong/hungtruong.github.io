Startup Incubation Week 5 Update!

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:07.014
Published on July 09, 2011.

00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:11.690
I’ve been in New York working on our startup for about 5 weeks now.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.907
So far the experience has been really enlightening.

00:00:15.407 --> 00:00:27.314
Between reading the Startup Genome Report, a handbook on Customer Development, listening to awesome lecturers talk about bizdev, pitching, pivoting, etc, I think I have a much better handle on what entrepreneurship really is.

00:00:28.314 --> 00:00:33.189
So far, we’ve probably pivoted about 2 times, and we’re not even at the halfway point yet!

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:39.603
The support from mentorships has been really helpful in understanding what startups really need to focus on to be successful.

00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:42.500
Without a market, there’s no company.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.356
Without the proper product to market fit, there’s no company.

00:00:46.856 --> 00:00:52.130
And if everything fits perfectly, you still need to be able to scale your service or product to meet demand!

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.206
Approaching a startup in a semi-scientific way is also very cool.

00:00:57.706 --> 00:01:08.255
Instead of looking at a startup as an ultra risky venture, you’re really looking for ways to prove hypotheses and make the thing as un-risky as possible while maximizing the potential upsides.

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:15.408
Bebarang is chugging along and I hope to provide an actual launch post some time soon (in private beta, of course).
