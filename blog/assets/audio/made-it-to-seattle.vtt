You may have noticed that this blog has been pretty quiet for the past few weeks.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.388
Okay, you probably haven’t.

00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:18.704
It’s because I traveled from Ann Arbor, MI to Seattle, Wa.

00:00:19.204 --> 00:00:20.162
All by myself!

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:22.820
My car actually helped a lot, too.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.857
I haven’t written much, yet I have much to write about.

00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:28.955
You might see a post here soon.

00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:32.411
Besides this post, telling you that I’ll be posting again soon…

00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:39.725
