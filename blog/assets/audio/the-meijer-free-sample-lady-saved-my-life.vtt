The Meijer Free Sample Lady Saved My Life!

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.460
Published on November 04, 2007.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.780
Yep. So today I went to Meijer for my weekly groceries.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.440
I had an extra hour, so I figured I’d be extra slovenly this morning.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.900
I made some coffee.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.480
I wasted time on the internet.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.020
Then I left.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.280
But I forgot to eat breakfast!

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.000
I only remembered this once I got to Meijer.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.700
I felt really weak, and realized I should’ve gotten food first.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.880
So I sorta just staggered around, getting stuff I needed.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.380
I went to the bottle return thingy too.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.080
Due to my weakness, I think I talked to myself a lot more (“soup get!”) and weirded people out.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.380
Wandering the aisles, I was trying to figure out if I could eat anything, then pay for it later.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.760
But that doesn’t really work in grocery stores.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.820
I would’ve sampled some Jelly Bellies, but I doubt that would have satiated my weak shell of a body.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:10.740
Luckily, about halfway through the adventure, I saw that the foreign-sounding lady (“here! it’s-a very good a-pumpkin cake!”) that’s always giving away free samples at the Saline Rd Meijer had setup a pumpkin cake sample area!

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.280
I ate one, and told her it was the first thing I had eaten all day.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.540
Then she gave me another!

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.120
She basically saved my life, maybe.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.120
I didn’t end up buying a cake, but I did buy lots of other crap today.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.780
So thank you foreign-sounding Meijer sample lady, whoever you are!
