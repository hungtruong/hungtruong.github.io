Wii Sports – Baseball

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.900
Published on January 29, 2007.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.980
So I was playing with my new Wii.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.200
The sports game that comes with it is really fun.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.980
One game that I suck at in real life, but can do okay in with Wii sports is Baseball.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.800
Unfortunately, I just lost my first game.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.820
I think the game gets harder as your skill level progresses.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.100
The first game, I got like, 11 runs or something.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.360
And there’s only 3 innings!

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:42.340
I’d say that Wii Baseball is probably the most physically challenging, since you’re either flinging the remote as fast as possible when pitching, or doing an actual bat swing when batting.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.960
Eventually I got tired of doing the whole “hey batter batter” thing and just used one hand.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.700
I still use two when I’m not sore, though.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.580
During my first loss, I found out that there’s a mercy rule.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.120
Yep, when you have 0 runs and the opponent has 5, it’s time to just give up.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.820
This is pretty much crap, since on my first game, I won by like, 10 runs or so.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.480
I totally would’ve made a sick comeback, too.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.060
Stupid Wii baseball…
