Observation: Bus Driver Camaraderie

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.940
Published on April 29, 2008.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.140
One thing I’ve noticed during my bus-riding career is that bus drivers have a really strong sense of camaraderie.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.440
Like, if a bus passes another bus, the bus driver might honk or wave at the other driver.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:28.700
During my days at UNM, this was pretty common since the busses took a circular route, and so it would make sense for a bus driver to say hi versus ignoring his/her co-worker.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.120
It was even pretty common for drivers to open up their windows, stop the bus, and start a little chat.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.140
This was kind of annoying since I was usually late for class.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.460
I think the camaraderie doesn’t end by just affiliating with the same university.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.400
I was riding the blue Michigan bus to work the other day and I noticed a cross-bus encounter!

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.900
The school bus driver was talking to the city bus driver across busses!

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.960
So this must be a really strong link between bus drivers of all types, regardless of employer or bus model.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.040
Is there some kind of strange connection being made between these bus drivers?

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.180
Is bus driving school a really uniting experience, like boot camp?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.760
Do bus drivers stick together and maybe have bus driving school reunions?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.420
Is there a bus driver’s guild!?

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.020
If anyone can shed light on this phenomenon I would greatly appreciate it.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.380
P.S. I spell the plural of bus “busses.”

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.240
Technically, it’s correct.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.900
It’s like the British version or something.
