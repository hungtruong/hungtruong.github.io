Recruiting Day: Google and Yahoo

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.780
Published on September 27, 2007.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:16.020
So in a strange turn of events, both Google and Yahoo were at the University of Michigan today, trying to get engineers to apply for jobs and internships.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.040
This is in addition to the Google talk I went to yesterday.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.160
The Google thing was sort of a meet and greet type of deal.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.220
I talked to a few people about getting internships.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.440
They gave me a tip: find someone on the inside to search for internships in a particular group, and have then forward your resume.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.180
Luckily, I have a pal from my undergrad years that will probably be willing to do this.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.700
To make up for me not getting a real prize last night, I got a $50 gift certificate for the Google Store .

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.680
NICE! As usual, Google had some free food, so I got a bagel and orange juice.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.040
I sorta stayed at the Google thing for too long (The Google thing started at 12 and Yahoo at 1) so I basically missed all of Yahoo’s thing.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.780
I did ask a question, though!

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:11.080
I asked the dude to describe the sort of hierarchy at Yahoo, as a bottom-up or top-down organization, and specifically what they do to encourage creativity.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.880
What I got was quite a bit of skirting around the issues, and not an answer to my actual question.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.820
Basically, I wanted to know if Yahoo has the same kind of culture that nurtures creativity like Google.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.840
And apparently they don’t.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.780
To be fair, the person I asked was a director of search and engineering.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.480
Way too high up to really understand what the code monkeys think.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.100
But in not answering my question, I think he answered it.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.060
Oh, and I got a notebook and pen from the Yahoo thing.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.360
That was like the most impressive thing about Yahoo.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.260
I mean, I’d still consider interning there.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.880
But their recruiting efforts need to be a lot better than this.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.260
They did give away two iPod Nanos in the course of today, but I got neither.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.600
Maybe that’s why I’m unimpressed…

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.080
After that, I had a few classes.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.700
But I semi-reluctantly decided to go to a Google talk at 4: instead of my Networks lab.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.520
I know, ditching class to see a lecture… But the lecture hall was too full!

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.540
So I just sat outside and tried listening to the lecture from outside the hall (there was a tv and the sound inside was being fed out with speakers).

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.480
It didn’t work too well, though.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.560
Then, I was really hungry.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.060
And ready for more free food.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.880
So I went to the Yahoo thing (a sort of repeat) at 5:30.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.740
This one had free pizza.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.920
The actual presentation was quite boring (by the same dude), but the end had free shirts and I also got a rubik’s cube.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.000
So in the end, my opinion of Google is about the same, and my opinion of Yahoo is actually slightly lower.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.340
I don’t have a thing against the underdog, but they’re the underdog for a reason.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.240
Yahoo had tons of market share before Google even existed.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.500
And after Google, Yahoo’s been embarrassed on many, many fronts.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:21.500
Oh, and the final shwag talley for the past 2 days is: Many Google pins (some say “I’m Feeling Lucky” and some say “Google” among other things), a white Google shirt, a $50 gift certificate for the Google Store, a notepad and pen from Yahoo, another light up pen from Yahoo, a Yahoo Rubik’s cube, and a Yahoo shirt.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.680
Not too bad if you ask me.
