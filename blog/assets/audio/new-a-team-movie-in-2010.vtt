New A-Team Movie in 2010!

00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:06.694
Published on January 10, 2010.

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:12.089
There was recently a trailer released for the new A-Team movie coming out this year:

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.925
While the movie looks like it might be good, I have a few concerns.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:19.603
Mr. T is not in it

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:23.320
It looks like people actually get shot in the movie

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.519
Mr. T is not in it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.391
My first concern is that since Mr. T is still huge and in charge these days, why not just have him play B.A. Baracus!

00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:41.963
I pity the fool who has to play Mr. T’s part while not actually being Mr. T. I bet he even has a last name with more than one character!

00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:46.319
My second concern is that people will get shot in this movie.

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.056
In the TV show, no one ever got shot.

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:52.753
They were shot at, but no bullets ever entered anyone.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:58.767
Actually, I think there may have been an episode where a person was shot, but I don’t think it was ever fatal.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:04.322
I hope that they at least make Mr. T (or the dude who’s playing him) afraid of flying.

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:07.858
It looks like it from the scene in the plane in the trailer.

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:12.114
It’s kind of hard to tell, but I bet he drank some drugged milk or something.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:17.429
Oh, and Liam Neeson as Hannibal seems kind of wrong, but maybe he can pull it off.
