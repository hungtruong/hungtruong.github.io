Hung Truong: In PHP!

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.980
Published on March 14, 2007.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:15.060
So I decided that I should do a little bit in PHP since I’m going to have a Google interview soon and the most I’ve done before is manipulating other people’s code.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.680
I have my (semi-) professional site thingy over at the root of the site, hung-truong.com .

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.220
One thing that bugged me about doing that quick site was that I was writing everything in static html.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.320
So I had to statically write the menu bar thing so it showed the active menu item for each page.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.340
A lot of code was repeated, and it was generally pretty ugly.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.900
I figured it’d be a good exercise to redo that simple site in a php template of sorts.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.200
So I used this pre-existing templating class and modified it for my needs.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:59.220
Yeah, I’m still manipulating other peoples’ code, but at least in this case, the code is simple enough so that I understand how all of it works (I haven’t taken the time to go digging around in all of WordPress’ source yet).

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.660
Unfortunately the class was really simple, and it still couldn’t handle my dynamic menu bar list thing.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.200
So I wrote a quick class called Menubar and it works!

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.780
You can see the php version of my professional website at this location .

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.240
I might end up just making it the official one, once I know it’ll work ok.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.840
It was a bit of work, and I didn’t really change anything to the actual site, but if I ever end up adding another section, it’ll be a lot less work than before.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.260
Plus it sorta refreshed my (almost non-existent) PHP coding skills!
