Grocery Shopping in Seattle

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:06.454
Published on October 05, 2009.

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:10.571
As some of you may know, grocery shopping is very important to me.

00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:14.028
It’s one of my favorite adult activities to partake in.

00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:20.441
Which is to say that grocery shopping is one of those things that you do after making the transition from kid to adult.

00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:23.658
Or at least that’s what I like tricking myself into believing.

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:29.453
In Michigan, I went to Meijer , because it pretty much had everything I needed.

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:34.588
I’d also make a side trip to Trader Joe’s maybe once a month for hippie supplies.

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:39.483
Now, in a new city, I must figure out where to get my foods and stuffs.

00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:43.579
Meijer is strictly a Midwest chain, unfortunately.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.494
Now, the obvious choice would be to pick the closest grocery.

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:55.387
It’s pretty easy to calculate the distance to the closest grocery because I live above the PCC Food co-op thingy .

00:00:55.887 --> 00:00:59.803
Literally. I am on the fifth floor and they take up the first floor in my building.

00:01:00.303 --> 00:01:03.340
I could literally jump down to the store entrance.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.593
Actually, a firefighter pole setup might be safer and cooler, but I’ll have to ask my landlord about it.

00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:13.929
The PCC is pretty high quality; it makes Trader Joe’s look like Wal-mart.

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:21.382
But things there also cost an arm and a leg (good thing I upped my accidental death and dismemberment insurance (AD&D)).

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:28.834
So I go there for quick and inexpensive things, like bananas or other produce, or when I really need something bad (like tofu).

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:35.807
Also, PCC doesn’t sell anything that’s not “natural,” so I can’t get goldfish crackers or Drain-o there.

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:41.442
There is a Trader Joe’s in Ballard that’s pretty nearby that I’m hitting often.

00:01:41.942 --> 00:01:50.972
I also just discovered a Fred Meyer (I dunno if there’s a relation to Meijer) that has a Chase bank in it (bonus points, just like my old Meijer!).

00:01:51.472 --> 00:01:55.308
The Fred Meyer is gigantic and pretty close to Wal-mart vibe.

00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:59.084
I’ve also gone to Safeway for my unnatural foods.

00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:04.859
When I shop at the University Village, I can hit up the QFC (which is like Kroger/Smith’s) on the way.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:12.711
I haven’t been to Whole Foods yet, but I don’t see a reason to with the Whole Foods-ish PCC taking care of my overpriced grocery needs.

00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:19.444
There’s also apparently a place in Ballard called Ballard Market (appropriately) that’s supposed to be pretty decent.

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:26.897
I’ve also gone to the Asian market, Uwajimaya, in the International District, but that’s more of a specialty case.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:32.591
Also, I don’t eat enough food to shop at Costco ( orange juice excluded from this statement).

00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:37.027
As you can see, I am a bit obsessive about grocery shopping.

00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:42.721
I haven’t found a store that has all the stuff I need/want in one location at the price I’d like to pay.

00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:48.735
So for now I think I’ll forage around multiple stores, which is inconvenient but somewhat necessary.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:56.108
Ever since I read The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I feel like I should be a bit more careful in the purchasing and preparation of my food.

00:02:56.608 --> 00:03:00.444
I don’t feel too bad spending a chunk of change on something at PCC.

00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:06.457
Unless, of course, there’s a random markup and I can get the same thing somewhere else for 40% less.

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:12.711
Oh, and I just got a hold for In Defense of Food at the library, so hopefully that will make me a bit less picky.
