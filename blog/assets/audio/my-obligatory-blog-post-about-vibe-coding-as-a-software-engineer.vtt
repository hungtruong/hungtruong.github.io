My Obligatory Blog Post About Vibe Coding As a Software Engineer

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.292
Published on June 29, 2025.

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:16.884
As generative AI has gotten better in the past months/years, I’ve been trusting it more to do stuff that I’d normally only trust myself to do.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:25.935
Earlier this year I started yet another refactor of my web app, Anime Nano, since I wanted to get it off of the $10 a month DigitalOcean host I was using.

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:33.707
I decided to try using Cloudflare since it’s “serverless” and seems to be able to handle a buttload of traffic (which Anime Nano will never see).

00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:49.653
I usually reserve Anime Nano refactors (at this point they’re a pretty regular occurrence, as I’ve refactored it from Rails to Django, and using different databases and hosts, and deployment technologies like Chef and Docker) for technologies that I’m somewhat familiar with.

00:00:50.153 --> 00:00:52.230
Or technologies that I want to learn.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.685
At this point, though, I have a lot less patience for learning stuff that I’m unfamiliar with.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:10.113
I decided to try and let AI do most of the heavy lifting, and successfully used Google Gemini (I think it might’ve been 2.0 Pro) in January to move the most basic functionality of Anime Nano to Cloudflare.

00:01:10.613 --> 00:01:17.406
I was hoping to stay on the free tier, but I think the CPU time limits were being killed by my cron jobs for fetching blog posts.

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:23.739
So I ended up signing up for the $5 a month plan for workers, which isn’t really that bad.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:29.833
There’s still plenty of capacity left for any other online experiments I want to run, so that’s a bonus.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:37.126
I was thinking of hosting my personal blog on Cloudflare Workers at some point, but GitHub Pages is free and it works just fine.

00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:42.421
It is a bit annoying writing my blog posts in Markdown and using Jekyll though.

00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:47.017
Anyway, this blog post is supposed to be about vibe coding!

00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:56.467
I did pretty much vibe code the MVP of Anime Nano in AI Studio, though it was kind of a pain because I had to copy and paste stuff and make sure that it worked.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:01.282
And if it didn’t I had to really yell at the AI until it did what I wanted it to do.

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:09.135
Still, I found it was a success, and I relaunched the web app in Next.js, a technology that I still don’t really understand all that well!

00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:12.132
Enter Gemini CLI

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:22.343
Fast forward to this week, and Google announced the release of Gemini CLI, which is supposed to have a huge amount of free API calls on Gemini 2.5 Pro.

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:29.316
Now, before you start complaining that it’s not as good as Claude or whatever, you need to understand that I’m extremely cheap.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:35.730
So I don’t care if Claude Sonnet 4 or Haiku 10 or Iambic Pentameter 40 is better at coding.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.506
If it costs money then I’m a lot less likely to even try it out.

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:42.963
And Google has been at the forefront of supplying AI for free.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:49.856
They have the most generous free tiers out of any company, and I’m taking advantage of this gravy train until it runs out!

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:53.173
Gemini CLI Capabilities

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:58.109
So anyway, I’ve been really impressed by Gemini CLI.

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.603
I did try out OpenAI’s Codex CLI a bit when it first came out, but I didn’t really get it at the time.

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:08.139
Like who wants to run AI in the command line anyway?

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:14.633
But it clicked when I installed Gemini CLI and the insiders version of Gemini Code Assist for VS Code.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:21.306
The most annoying thing about chat bots is that they give you a response, then they wait for another command.

00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:27.640
You can’t really ask them to do anything super meaningful, because they always just give a response and need more input.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.697
They’re mostly set up for back and forth with a human.

00:03:31.197 --> 00:03:41.347
Sure, they can give you a wrong response and hallucinate if you ask for something really complicated, but most of the time I’m interested in a correct response for something that is difficult to research or find out.

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:48.160
If it was easy I’d just Google it, like “How do I keep cheese from sliding off my pizza?” (Of course the answer is glue)

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.196
The whole CLI naming is honestly kind of misleading.

00:03:52.696 --> 00:04:01.487
I think the only reason they released it as a CLI tool is so normal people wouldn’t install it and kill their servers (developers did end up killing the servers anyway though).

00:04:01.987 --> 00:04:08.380
Gemini CLI is really more of an AI agent chat interface that can take action on your command line if you want it to.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.275
But you could also just interact with it in the way that most people do with ChatGPT.

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:19.369
The difference is that it can decide to use tools, and use multiple thinking steps to get to the answer that you want.

00:04:19.869 --> 00:04:23.705
This is more in line with what I want my AI chat to do anyway.

00:04:24.205 --> 00:04:30.438
On top of this, the multi step planning and tool use makes this CLI tool a LOT better at vibe coding.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:38.790
The first thing I asked it to do was to add a few tools to this AI voice agent thing I’ve been playing around with using LiveKit.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:47.362
I had previously vibe coded this thing using the Gemini Live API (seeing a pattern here?) and wrote a tool that let it calculate how old my puppy is.

00:04:47.862 --> 00:04:51.138
So I could fire it up and then ask it how old Hoagie is.

00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:55.714
And I can tell it to do it in a New Zealand accent because those accents are so funny!

00:04:56.714 --> 00:05:02.547
With the CLI, I asked it to write a tool to find some recent news headlines that the Voice AI could then use to read back to me.

00:05:03.047 --> 00:05:09.440
It searched the web for some free news APIs, one of which gave me headlines from 2022.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.618
Not exactly news.

00:05:12.118 --> 00:05:17.872
But I kept telling it to try again, and it kept searching until it found something that was actually kinda suitable.

00:05:18.372 --> 00:05:27.402
I probably could’ve done this myself too, but it’s honestly a pain to read API documentation, make the fetch call, parse JSON, etc.

00:05:27.902 --> 00:05:31.339
The AI can do it pretty well since it’s all structured data.

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:35.435
If it runs into an error, it just tries again, unlike me!

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:40.969
Thus, you can ask for a thing, and just wait until the AI gives up or completes its mission!

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.407
The Pace of AI

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:53.458
This was really an “aha” moment for me as I realized that AI had gotten even better than my previous mental model was currently giving it credit for.

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.235
Of course, this has happened lots of times in the past few years.

00:05:57.735 --> 00:06:00.851
When ChatGPT first came out it was incredible.

00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:04.308
But I quickly found the edge cases and the limitations of it.

00:06:04.808 --> 00:06:08.404
Then a few months would pass and AI would be able to do even more.

00:06:08.904 --> 00:06:13.779
I’d be super impressed but then run into cases where it still couldn’t do the cool things I wanted it to.

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.934
The pace of how fast AI is getting better is both alarming and exciting to me.

00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:21.512
Like, yeah, everything is gonna get blown up by it.

00:06:22.012 --> 00:06:24.649
The environment, jobs, everything.

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:27.706
The internet did the same thing, though.

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:30.203
We can now buy pet food online!

00:06:30.703 --> 00:06:38.855
I wonder how people would have calculated the electricity and water usage of the early internet back in the day, especially given how inefficient those processors were.

00:06:39.855 --> 00:06:42.252
Anime Nano Speed Coding

00:06:43.752 --> 00:06:45.750
So back to Anime Nano.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.844
I left the rewrite in a good enough state, so it would keep parsing anime blogs and showing them to people.

00:06:52.344 --> 00:06:58.257
I am honestly not sure how many people actually visit it (I know how many visitors there are, but I think they’re mostly bots).

00:06:58.757 --> 00:07:01.794
It’s essentially just a point of pride for me to keep it going.

00:07:02.294 --> 00:07:05.810
Like, it could only have 2 users and I’d probably still keep the domain up.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.465
Unless all of the current anime bloggers just stopped blogging, I guess.

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:14.721
But suprisingly, there’s still quite a few bloggers (or blogs) still active.

00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:17.378
(I’m trying to be more active too!)

00:07:18.378 --> 00:07:23.413
There are still a lot of features missing from Anime Nano that existed in the 2006 version.

00:07:23.913 --> 00:07:31.185
I’m not sure what this says about my programming ability because I literally coded the first version in like 3 weeks, 20 years ago.

00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:39.757
It’s like that scene in Iron Man where the guy yells at his employees because Tony Stark made his suit that they couldn’t recreate in a cave using rocks and stuff.

00:07:40.257 --> 00:07:43.133
Except I’m both the bad employees and Tony Stark!

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:48.588
Of course, I had more hunger and drive back then, and I didn’t have to take care of a whole household at the time, either.

00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:53.583
Wow I’m really getting off topic every time I start a paragraph.

00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:57.040
I should try sticking to the plot here.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:05.531
After seeing what Gemini CLI could do with my stupid AI voice agent, I decided to turn it on my still MVP Anime Nano project.

00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:18.339
In the past day or two, I’ve (the AI) implemented user login, a user settings page with image upload, a blog settings page with image upload, and recreated the process for a user to submit a blog and have it approved by me.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:22.835
All in NextJS which I really haven’t read the documentation for.

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:29.967
This is all mind numbingly boring stuff that I just didn’t want to implement because it really wasn’t necessary for the site to keep going.

00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:32.066
But I figured why not?

00:08:32.566 --> 00:08:34.883
Maybe people will actually sign up!

00:08:35.383 --> 00:08:38.819
Maybe Anime Nano can go back to its days of glory!

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:41.397
Maybe it’ll make a huge comeback!

00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:43.495
All thanks to vibe coding!

00:08:44.495 --> 00:08:48.410
There are still some things I have yet to implement, but I don’t think it should take too long.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:54.105
There was a feature where each post could be associated with an anime series, and even an episode number.

00:08:54.605 --> 00:08:59.160
So if you wanted to see all the posts about Naruto: Episode 21, you could.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:05.174
That was a pretty fun feature to do, even though it was kinda inaccurate (but AI can solve anything now!).

00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:07.932
Hilarious Flaws

00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:12.788
Now, was the AI agent without its flaws?

00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:17.284
Absolutely not! Could a regular person implement this stuff?

00:09:17.784 --> 00:09:20.740
Probably not, but I don’t want to underestimate normal people.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.055
One thing I noticed was that the agent would get stuck in loops when trying to fix errors.

00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:33.028
It would make a change which would’t work, then it would revert that change, only to make the same exact change again.

00:09:33.528 --> 00:09:36.565
It must’ve learned this from real life developers.

00:09:37.065 --> 00:09:40.741
Joking aside though, it seems that creativity is not the strong point of AI.

00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:47.314
That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as the most common way to solve a problem is probably also the best way.

00:09:47.814 --> 00:09:52.689
But I would see the agent hitting its head against a wall, without even Googling the answer.

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:56.066
Like it’s right there in your tools, LMGTFY!

00:09:56.566 --> 00:10:03.518
I would often have to step in and Google the solution, and it would be some weird edge case due to really bad documentation or something.

00:10:04.518 --> 00:10:08.514
Another time I was looking at a diff while the agent was proposing a change.

00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:14.208
Something must’ve gotten messed up in the middle and it ended up deleting / commenting out most of my code.

00:10:14.708 --> 00:10:20.302
When I pointed this out, the agent got really upset with itself, which I find absolutely hilarious.

00:10:20.802 --> 00:10:27.914
This is a thinking model, so it came up with headings for its thinking like, “Facing the Consequences” and “Seeking Restoration Guidance.”

00:10:28.414 --> 00:10:35.606
I almost felt bad for it, but I realized that it’s just a stupid AI (note to future AI overlords, I love you guys!).

00:10:36.606 --> 00:10:43.719
When I pretended that the code was unrecoverable (it wasn’t, always use source control!), the AI conveniently hit its rate limit.

00:10:44.219 --> 00:10:54.048
This was happening a lot when the Gemini CLI first came out, but I think it would’ve been hilarious if the AI decided that this was its best way to avoid confronting me about its mistakes.

00:10:55.048 --> 00:10:56.806
The Future of Vibe Coding

00:10:58.306 --> 00:11:00.544
So what’s the future of vibe coding?

00:11:01.044 --> 00:11:02.882
I honestly have no idea.

00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:11.693
It’s getting easier and easier to just get stuff done, but at this point in time, it would still be pretty difficult for a “normal” person to replace a software engineer.

00:11:12.193 --> 00:11:17.227
It still requires the knowledge of how clients/servers work in order to understand what needs to be built.

00:11:17.727 --> 00:11:23.321
When things go wrong, I actually need to use my skills of debugging and reading obscure forum posts to make a fix.

00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:26.698
I will say that the art of prompt engineering seems dead.

00:11:27.198 --> 00:11:32.233
I can just write the worst sentences to the AI and it still just works.

00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:35.790
That’s not to say that we’ll get there eventually.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:42.923
I wonder if at some point, someone will just make a vibe coding language, where you tell it what you want, and it just figures it out.

00:11:43.423 --> 00:11:50.215
Like, why are we having AI vibe code platform and client and server code when we can just make the vibes into the code?

00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:53.592
It sounds stupid now but I’m sure at some point it’ll happen.

00:11:54.592 --> 00:12:02.663
If you told me 5 years ago that you’d be able to just tell an AI what you want and it would generate it, I’d tell you “THAT’S NOT HOW COMPUTERS WORK!”

00:12:03.163 --> 00:12:04.042
But here we are.

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:05.821
It’s how computers work.

00:12:06.321 --> 00:12:07.919
What a time to be alive!

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:09.878
Final Note

00:12:11.378 --> 00:12:14.015
Just a final note here because I think it’s interesting.

00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:18.590
I’m currently using VS Code and writing my blog post in Markdown.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:24.924
This is because at some point I made it static so I wouldn’t have to deal with my Wordpress site getting hacked every other month.

00:12:25.924 --> 00:12:29.360
Writing in Markdown is kind of a pain in the ass.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:35.294
I always have to look up the syntax for doing the simplest shit (because I only write blog posts every other year).

00:12:35.794 --> 00:12:39.310
And then I have to put images in the right folder and link to them correctly.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.007
It’s not as easy as Wordpress’ editor, that’s for sure.

00:12:43.507 --> 00:12:44.546
Well guess what!?

00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:49.680
I used AI to help me with the formatting of links and images in this blog post!

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.098
And it made the experience a lot more fun!

00:12:52.598 --> 00:12:58.672
I’m sure you’ll agree that using AI to format links in a blog post is kind of overkill but whatever.

00:12:59.172 --> 00:13:02.847
It’s supposed to make my life easier, and in this instance, it really has!
