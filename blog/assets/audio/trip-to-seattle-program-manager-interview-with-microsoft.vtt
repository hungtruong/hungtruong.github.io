Trip To Seattle (+ Program Manager Interview With Microsoft)!

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.060
Published on November 30, 2008.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.660
I have been noticeably absent in this blog and others this month.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.440
So in typical Hung Truong Blog fashion, I felt like I should write about what’s going on in my life, including my everlasting job hunt.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.220
I know some have gained quite a lot of pleasure in reading about my various job hunt activities .

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:35.760
Job hunting is kind of fun, especially when you’re in school and you don’t actually have a dire need for a job (well, I already have a job, but I know it’s gonna run out when I graduate).

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.400
Anyway, last weekend I interviewed at Microsoft for a Program Manager position.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.340
You might recall that I interviewed with Orbitz a few weeks prior.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.600
I got an offer from Orbitz and let the recruiters at MS know.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.260
Then the MS recruiters hurried up the process and let me interview with them.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.920
Pretty cool! I ended up declining the Orbitz offer (but it was awesome and I would have taken it if I hadn’t gotten a better offer, more on that later).

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.240
Um, I realize at this point that in the interest of actually getting a job, I should be neutral when I talk about companies.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.900
Luckily, all of the companies I’ve dealt with so far have been class acts.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.800
So I don’t really need to hold anything back.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.340
They’ve been awesome.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.280
The whole experience of job hunting has been a real eye-opener for me.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.580
From exploding offers and figuring out offer goodness, I’ve been learning a lot.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.420
So anyway, I flew to Seattle and got there at around 11am.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.160
I got a rental car (a Toyota Highlander SUV) and drove to the Pike Place Market , which is apparently one of the really cool places to see.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.540
I got lunch there and wandered around various shops.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.200
Then I decided to go to the Seattle Library , which is really super awesome.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.460
And being a student at a library school, I knew I needed to check it out.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.920
The library had multiple floors of awesome.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.940
The decor in there is like Ikea, except cooler!

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.440
And it’s in a library!

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.920
On my interview day, I tried leaving early but it took me a while to find Building 19 (the HR building) where I was supposed to meet with my recruiter.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.460
Microsoft campus is huge-ass.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.560
I was a little late.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.060
19 is probably the spiffiest building I encountered, with its sorta dim lighting (for mood), Microsoft Surface to play with, and Rock Band!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.640
There were a lot of other students there waiting for their recruiter to get them.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.300
They all seemed kinda nervous.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.680
It was hard to get them to even acknowledge I was trying to joke around with them and get a posse to play.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.900
Then, I was about to start a song when my recruiter called my name. Ah, well.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.300
From 10-4 it was interviews.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.760
They were each an hour long, except for a “lunch” interview which lasted 1.5 hours.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.180
And I had 30 minutes to sort of pass out after lunch before the final two interviews.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.720
_Note to people looking for info on questions they ask in Microsoft interviews: don’t bother.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.460
I’ve noticed that a lot of people find my blog while they’re looking for interview questions to prepare for their own interviews.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.960
The thing that people don’t understand is that everyone asks different questions.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.740
And you don’t need to know the answers beforehand anyway.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.200
The whole point of the questions is that you answer them on the spot, and that the process of answering the question is what the interviewer wants to see.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.660
So if you knew the answer already, you might do worse in the interviewer’s eyes because they’d be like, “what the heck? This person doesn’t think!”

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.680
Also, most of my questions were about me, so you’d have to do a lot of studying about Hung Truong if you wanted to ace my particular interview questions.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.960
The interviews themselves were thoughtful and pretty cool.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.420
The people interviewing me were really smart and all seemed like cool dudes to work with.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.120
I mean, as a self-respecting geek I know that Microsoft has a certain reputation for software.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.540
The thing is that a company as big as Microsoft will inevitably have great products and not-so-great products.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.760
Also, I read this article in Fast Company about Gary Flake , my new(est) role model!

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:19.300
MS is finally entering the web space like they mean it and it’ll be interesting to see how they approach it and how it will affect the other big players (Google and Yahoo… to some extent).

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.780
Finally, I had a chance to have dinner with a current MS employee.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.920
I chose my former classmate, Sameer .

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.780
He and his wife took me to the Space Needle Restaurant, which was incredibly touristy and awesome.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.560
Oh, and expensive.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.660
Thanks for footing the bill, Microsoft! Seriously!

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.580
I know that most of my job hunt posts end in some kind of failure post ( example 1 , example 2 , example 3 , example 4 , etc).

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.280
I’ve gotten pretty used to rejection over the past few years.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.900
But! It seems I’ve gotten better at interviewing!

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.440
For I got an offer!

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.060
I can’t (and probably shouldn’t) disclose certain things, so let’s just leave it at that.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.800
I have about a week to make my decision.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.580
I will probably make another post when I do make a final decision.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.360
And then we’ll finally have a proper burial for my series of job hunt posts, once and for all (or at least hopefully for a while!).
