Craigslist and Google Maps Mashup Thingy: Day 9 – CSS Foo and CakePHP Helpers

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.980
Published on April 25, 2007.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.340
Today I did a bunch of CSS, making the mashup thing actually look kind of nice.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.480
Later, I may add some more “Web 2.0” features such as drop shadows and gradients.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.020
I was having a hard time getting the map to show up in the div with a few of the css layouts I downloaded, so I just decided to code it by hand.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.560
I think it looks pretty neat; the map stretches across the whole screen and then the other content is shown in absolutely positioned divs.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.360
I also did some stuff with the CakePHP helpers.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.900
CakePHP’s inferiority to Rails is really starting to show to me. I think it’s all a product of PHP having not been created for this kind of MVC design.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.320
CakePHP tries to follow the conventions of Rails, but it does so in a sort of copycat manner.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.020
As such, the result does not meet or exceed the original.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.060
In the case of Helpers, Rails automagically links the named helper to the controller.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.200
In CakePHP, you must specify that a certain controller uses a certain helper.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.060
It’s kind of annoying.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.440
There also isn’t any support for the Rails convention of “partials,” which is why I’m using their helpers to begin with… It’s annoying.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:30.480
Also, I find it annoying that CakePHP finds an objects associated objects by default when using “find()” or “findAll().”

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.660
It’s useful when I want it, but when I don’t, it wastes a lot of memory!

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.240
Now that I think of it, I’m not sure if Rails does this by default or not.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.700
The only reason I mention it is because I kept getting out of memory errors (or more accurately, memory limit errors) with my application.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.760
It’s a big waste when all I want is the name of the area and CakePHP fetches ALL of the associated listings for that area…

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.000
I must sound really whiny right now.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:12:52.780
I guess it’s just from some frustration in learning a new language/framework instead of using one that I’m used to.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.840
It’s good for me, I won’t argue against that.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:03.220
It’s just a bit disappointing to see all of these flaws when a framework is purported to be things like “stable” and “good.”

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.780
Oh, and also, I should say that I think my actual mashup is coming along pretty nicely.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.520
It should be ready in a few more “days,” where a “day” is one I am actively working on the mashup.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:22.420
I could probably “release” it pretty soon, but usually when I release something, it means I won’t work on it much anymore, moving to something else I find interesting.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.640
So I should probably actually have it done before I release it…
