Alexa T-Shirts: WHY!?

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.620
Published on May 13, 2007.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.540
So I was checking out the Alexa ranking of MapsKrieg , and I saw this link that was selling personalized shirts based on the Alexa ranking of a site.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:29.560
Ummm, what!? The shirts display stats like your Alexa ranking and quotes like, “0.00005% say my site rocks!” (which doesn’t sound like something I’d boast about), and “Will dance for better Alexa rank.”

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.720
I find it scary that someone actually took the time to prepare the templates for these shirts (they’re printed by Zazzle).

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.340
Has anyone in the history of the universe bought one of these?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.400
Perhaps an overzealous SEO fanatic?

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:53.660
But really, is anyone so obsessed with their Alexa ranking that they’d buy a shirt (that would probably end up being inaccurate by the time the shirt was printed and delievered anyway)!?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.580
If you know anyone who has bought one of these shirts, please inform me.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.920
And punch them in the face for me, too.
