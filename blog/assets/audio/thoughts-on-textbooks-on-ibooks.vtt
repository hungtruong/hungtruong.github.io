Thoughts on Textbooks on iBooks

00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:06.055
Published on January 22, 2012.

00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:20.082
I was thinking about the latest news from Apple, that they were partnering with textbook publishers to bring cheaper textbooks directly to the iPad while at the same time releasing an application for anyone to publish iBooks for the Apple Bookstore.

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:35.068
Perhaps I am being cynical, but it’s always appeared to me that the main business model of a textbook publisher is to slightly tweak versions of a textbook, altering page numbers and quiz questions in order to force students to buy newer editions instead of used ones.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:41.401
Perhaps the industry is thinking that iBooks will eliminate the used book market, and they’re probably right.

00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:45.657
But this could also have some negative (for publishers) side effects as well.

00:00:46.657 --> 00:00:50.253
Apple is lowering the distribution costs of textbooks dramatically.

00:00:50.753 --> 00:00:59.864
Assuming that schools actually pay for a set of iPads for each student, it becomes trivially easy (with the iBook publishing software) to create free textbooks for schools.

00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:03.080
Who would want to give textbooks away for free?

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:16.288
Teachers. There are cases of teachers self-publishing for their own schools, but for this idea to really work, I think teachers would need to collaboratively create a textbook that meets either regional or national standards and release it for free on iBooks.

00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:20.783
If you don’t believe this will happen, take a look at Khan Academy .

00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:28.975
Previous attempts to create free textbooks have been hit or miss. I am not quite sure how popular Wikibooks are in the classroom.

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:32.752
The problem is probably that of traction and scale.

00:01:33.252 --> 00:01:37.247
Previously, no one has created a standard for e-textbook distribution.

00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:39.985
Apple is doing that with iBooks.

00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:46.478
The beautiful part is that they’re bootstrapping it with traditional publishers who are probably digging their own grave.

00:01:47.478 --> 00:01:49.796
Of course, this could play out in a number of ways.

00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:56.449
Maybe iBooks will prove to be too costly for most public schools to adopt (I’m guessing this is very likely).

00:01:56.949 --> 00:02:03.662
If only private schools or schools with a lot of funding can support them, it may not become worthwhile to create free textbooks for all.

00:02:04.662 --> 00:02:09.696
What I’d hope to see is a slow adoption of iPads in the classroom using iBooks as textbooks.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:18.108
Once a critical mass of schools is using iBooks, free textbooks will be developed and adopted by certain school districts and spread to others.

00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:28.778
I’m glad to see that Apple is trying to “disrupt” (I lose some points here by using a word I hate) the textbook industry, and it’s awesome that they’re partnering with that industry to do it.

00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:34.792
I’m really looking forward to seeing how this plays out, hopefully for the benefit of our education system.
