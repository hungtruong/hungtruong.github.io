Facebook Removing Network Pages: WTF?

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.700
Published on May 31, 2008.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.580
I was browsing around Facebook today when I thought of checking the network pages for my universities.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.560
Network pages are interesting because you can see stuff that’s popular in your particular network.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.260
While the Network pages seem to be rarely used, I still think they’re interesting to have around.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.760
For example, here’s the statistics page for Michigan as of right now:

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.440
I found it really difficult to find the network page today.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.660
In fact, I had to go to google and query for “facebook networks” to actually find the networks page.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
This is because Facebook is apparently discontinuing the network pages.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.360
Now is a good time for me to ask, “WTF!?”

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.460
Social networks are interesting because they have multiple variables.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.120
People know each other through networks, especially by regional and work networks.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
By removing network pages, Facebook is losing a pretty important source of info.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.200
I understand they’re not removing actual networks; just their pages.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.580
But still, why bother getting rid of something?

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.080
They aren’t really being used, but I still like to check them now and then to get a quick overview of what’s happening.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.240
Recently, Facebook seems to be closer and closer to jumping that proverbial shark.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.220
Not just because of this change, but because of changes to the developer platform as well.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.480
It’s gotten to the point where one cannot casually write applications for Facebook because the functions they use will surely become deprecated within months.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.780
Can you imagine that happening on a real OS?

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:44.920
Combine the “alpha” hijinks of the platform with the fact that no meaningful income is being made on the apps, and you have a formula for slow, rotting death of applications!

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.240
Will the next Facebook please stand up?
