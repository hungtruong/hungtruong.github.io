Extremely Online: a Book Review and a Retrospective on My Blog!

00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:07.973
Published on December 27, 2023.

00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:16.724
I recently found out about a book called: “Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet” by Taylor Lorenz.

00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:22.818
As someone who self identifies as extemely online, I needed to see what this book was about.

00:00:23.318 --> 00:00:27.793
It ended up catapulting me on a journey through my own blog and online history.

00:00:28.793 --> 00:00:30.711
It All Began With The “Blog”

00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:41.721
As someone who grew up with technology, I feel like an expert, but also an old man. I started blogging in 2002, which is basically internet pre-history.

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:48.295
As an elder Millenial I don’t really “get” TikTok, but I do pretend to know the latest slang, no cap.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:56.007
The book starts with the blogging revolution as the first major technology that put power into users’ hands and away from traditional media.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:04.839
As an aside, I had a webpage as early as 1994 or 1995, when Geocities came out.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:15.169
I somehow remember that my url was “/Hollywood/Hills/7923” (this was literally 30 years ago) and as it turns out, it was archived by archive.org!!

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:19.904
(I actually have a backup on my computer so I wouldn’t have lost it either way)

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:27.936
I’d argue that Geocities really started this trend, while blogging software made it even more accessible to the average person.

00:01:28.436 --> 00:01:32.912
Because if I as a 6th grader could do it, I’m pretty sure anyone else could have.

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:41.583
Lorenz goes quickly through the rise of blogging, pointing out that blogs were beating newspapers in the speed and depth of their reporting.

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:46.878
Who wanted to wait for the paper to be delivered (!) to their doorstep to know what happened the previous day?

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:52.333
As blogs showed their superiority to traditional media, people started latching onto it.

00:01:52.833 --> 00:02:00.824
And as bloggers gained more and more credibility, their potential to earn a living became greater, through display ads, affiliate marketing, and influencer marketing.

00:02:01.824 --> 00:02:10.615
The first section of the book was particularly nostalgic for me, as I remember the hype for blogs reaching a high point, and their subsequent fall from relevance.

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:15.909
At the height of blog-mania, there were even news stories about how dangerous blogging had become.

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.323
I recall that around 2006, I dreamed of creating a blog empire and getting rich from the traffic.

00:02:22.823 --> 00:02:26.659
That obviously didn’t happen, but I didn’t do too badly either.

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.577
Then Social Media Came

00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:33.554
Of course, practically no one actually blogs anymore.

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:38.369
I’m pretty sure you get a free blog when you sign up for AARP membership.

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:43.903
Social media came and created stronger links between individuals than a blogroll ever could.

00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:49.378
It was through social media that a random kid in suburban Florida could become a tastemaker.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:58.909
While I only ever wanted to use Facebook for keeping in touch with my friends, I do remember using my Twitter account to expand my reach among the technorati.

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.368
Or at least trying.

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:04.784
The closest I got was hobnobbing with celebs at SXSW.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:10.498
Here, Lorenz describes the proto-celebrities who were famous for being famous.

00:03:10.998 --> 00:03:18.510
People like Tila Tequila and Julia Allison (who I honestly never followed at the time) fit this bill long before Kim Kardashian did.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:28.541
One of the most interesting things to me about the book was the recurring theme of a new technology slowly gaining mainstream acceptance, and with it, the ability to monetize.

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:35.674
At first, bloggers merely got free stuff for making posts (which is as far as I ever got, though I did get a LOT of anime).

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:40.009
Next, they would demand payment for promoting a particular product.

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:44.025
After that, they might get a cut of sale through an affiliate link.

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:49.959
None of these strategies were planned by the platforms that enabled them, but hey, people like making money.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:04:02.068
This played out again and again, through platforms like Instagram, which was absolutely opposed to advertising for a very long time, to YouTube, to Tumblr, to TikTok and Snapchat.

00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:08.822
On a personal note, I really enjoyed reading these stories as someone who has tried to make money online in a bunch of different ways.

00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:14.436
For example, I made my dog into an influencer and had quite a few sponsorship deals.

00:04:14.936 --> 00:04:19.091
See this ad for Keystone Light, or this one for some dog toy.

00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:26.245
I was also thrust into the YouTube Partner Program after finding some viral success with my video about Trombone Champ.

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:29.781
When I say I’m Extremely Online, I mean it!

00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:32.140
But Not For Me

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.074
While the first half or so of the book really resonated with me, the back half was not as engaging.

00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:44.528
It documented a bunch of more recent “celebrities” who, as an oldie, I am just not familiar with.

00:04:45.028 --> 00:04:51.741
I have no interest in “internet tea” between one dumbass prank Youtuber and another, or a TikToker famous for inventing a dance.

00:04:52.741 --> 00:05:02.731
I did, however, find it interesting that people started pushing back against the highly produced perfect Instagram content for highly produced (to look less produced) relatable Instagram content.

00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:06.767
Also, I am fucking scared to death of going on TikTok.

00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:19.974
This might just be my oldness talking, but I suspect that in 5 years or so, we’re going to look back at all of the TikTok challenges and memes with the same kind of cringe that we do for “AWESOMESAUCE BBQ! EPIC FAIL!” language.

00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:25.429
Because cringe is timeless, and one day cringe will come for us all, even Gen Z.

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:29.386
As Grandpa Simpson famously put it:

00:05:30.386 --> 00:05:33.742
I used to be with ‘it’, but then they changed what ‘it’ was.

00:05:34.242 --> 00:05:38.477
Now what I’m with isn’t ‘it’ anymore and what’s ‘it’ seems weird and scary.

00:05:38.977 --> 00:05:40.016
It’ll happen to you!

00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:47.809
Crap, I just realized that I seem even older now that I’m quoting a show that’s been on the air for… 34 YEARS!?

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:50.647
Back To My Blog

00:05:52.147 --> 00:05:58.700
I will say, however, that this book really brought back my interest in the earlier days of the internet, and my blog.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.871
There was even a section where the author described an event where the minor internet celebrity, “Grumpy Cat,” made an appearance at SXSW.

00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:09.609
THE VERY SAME EVENT WHERE THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN:

00:06:10.609 --> 00:06:17.242
After reading about the timelines that I personally participated in, I had to take a stroll down memory lane though my blog.

00:06:17.742 --> 00:06:19.979
Yes, the very same one you’re reading.

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:26.413
After moving it for the Nth time, I didn’t really check the older posts for broken images or links.

00:06:26.913 --> 00:06:35.544
Since it’s a holiday break, and I don’t have anything better to do, I went through every single post, from 2002 to today, and fixed up all of the issues that I could.

00:06:36.544 --> 00:06:42.457
I fixed formatting, weird image sizing and alignment issues, and went through every link to see if it had died.

00:06:42.957 --> 00:06:48.471
I replaced all of the dead links with archive.org links, if they were available.

00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:57.682
And I made sure that the archive.org link was timestamped to the closest date to the actual blog post, so you could get the best context possible for what I was thinking at the time.

00:06:58.682 --> 00:07:04.995
As a side note, archive.org is amazing, and I’m definitely going to donate some money to it so it can keep doing its thing.

00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:10.710
As I read my old blog posts, I couldn’t help but feel nostalgic for the person I used to be.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.366
I started out super naive, and gradually became more and more mature.

00:07:15.866 --> 00:07:19.062
By which I mean my fart apps have been getting more and more complex.

00:07:20.062 --> 00:07:27.174
Anyway, I might expand on this in a future post, as this one is getting long and I’m quickly getting away from the scope of this book review.

00:07:27.674 --> 00:07:33.748
This book has definitely reignited my interest in blogging, and generally sharing more of my experiences in writing.

00:07:34.248 --> 00:07:39.842
Now that Twitter (I mean X) is a true cesspool, I might retreat back to my true roots.

00:07:40.842 --> 00:07:42.759
Overall, I liked this book.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.935
The beginning was great, but the second half didn’t really hold my interest.

00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:51.830
Even so, I’d recommend giving it a read if, like me, you are EXTREMELY ONLINE!
