More Ann Arbor Observations

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.620
Published on September 26, 2007.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.900
Today I went to a Google info session.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.640
Mainly to score a free shirt and pizza.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.380
The coolest thing to happen was that the guy had me pick a random number from 1 to 80.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.000
I picked 65, which just happened to be my number.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.060
I thought he was going to ask me a trivia question so I could win a prize, but apparently I picked the winner.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.680
Myself. They made me pick another guy though.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.580
So no prize for me, just another shirt.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.640
That’s cool, I like free Google shirts.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.060
If I get enough I’ll set up a “Google Week” where I wear nothing but Google shirts (and my normal jeans).

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.700
Waiting for the bus back to my apartment, I encountered a huge group of engineering freshmen straight out of their first programming test.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.160
It was really nostalgic hearing people freak out about data types and assignment operators.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.860
Apparently they had a test for Engineering 101, which is C++ programming.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.200
Ah, to be a freshman again.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.820
Also worth noting was that there were girls in the group.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.280
As in, plural.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.700
Enjoy it while it lasts, guys.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.960
(I’m not a misogynist or anything, just a realist. I wish there were more girls in engineering, but the cold hard truth is there aren’t)

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.280
I think I’ve finally discovered what it means to be immersed in an academic setting.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.940
I went to an organizing meeting for a social computing group at the university.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.840
We exchanged some really cool ideas and for once my attention was kept for an entire meeting!

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.020
This usually never happens.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.840
I’ve also found myself starting random intellectual conversations with people.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.780
It’s all very cool and something that never happened in my undergrad years.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.380
I’ve also found myself waking up early in the morning and not being able to sleep because I was thinking.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.560
Just thinking of ideas and possibilities that would keep me awake.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.900
This has happened before when I first started exploring opportunities in web development, but it’s happening again.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.040
Which is sort of understandable, I guess.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.180
There’s so many ideas that are bouncing around in my head; from course readings to conversations to my work at the library.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.820
In short, I’m enjoying the academic atmosphere that this campus has to offer.
