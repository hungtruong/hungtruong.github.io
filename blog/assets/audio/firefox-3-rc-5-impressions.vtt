Firefox 3 RC 5 Impressions

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.100
Published on April 14, 2008.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.780
So I installed Firefox 3, RC5 because my old Firefox install was pooping out on downloading .

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.520
css files for some reason, which left website viewing to be less than desirable.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.040
It seems okay, I guess.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.180
I think I’m already used to the new UI that makes the back button bigger than the forward button.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.600
Even though I sort of hated it at first, I guess it makes sense since people go back more often than forward (via the buttons, anyway).

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.680
So Firefox 3 runs a lot faster, and using a lot less ram.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.300
In the past, I have yelled at Firefox like Mel Gibson in Ransom asking for my ram back .

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.880
I have 5 tabs open right now and I’m only (my expectations aren’t that high) using ~165MB or ram.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.540
The whole thing moves a lot faster too.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.960
I’m not sure if that’s because of the added side effect of more than half of my plugins not being compatible, though.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.380
I can live without most of them, but Firebug is really sort of indispensable.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.960
I hope FF3 comes out soon officially so everyone will get their plugins updated.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.980
There seems to be something weird going on with Flash 9 as well.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.520
Not too sure what.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.200
So far, I’d say Firefox 3 is lookin’ good.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.740
I totally skipped getting a Firefox 2 shirt , so I’ll definitely have to get the 3 when it ships!
