Firefox 3.5 beta 99 – Get Multitouch Gestures Back!

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.852
Published on June 09, 2009.

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:15.526
I just updated to the newest beta of Firefox 3.5 and it’s apparently beta 99.

00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:19.142
This is pretty funny because the previous one was 4.

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:23.158
I think it’s just an indicator that they’re pretty close to a release candidate.

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:30.951
One thing I really like about Firefox (at least these beta versions) is that they support multitouch gestures on my Macbook Pro.

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:40.481
Pinching zooms out, un-pinching (spreading?) zooms in, three finger swipe up goes to the top of the page and three finger swipe down goes to the bottom.

00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:42.420
This is really cool.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.854
One of the weirder ones is that twisting with two fingers lets you go back and forth between tabs.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:52.630
I thought it was wacky at first but now I think it’s very useful.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.283
For some reason, the default value for this gesture is disabled in the newest version (beta 99).

00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:02.660
It’s also disabled in Shiretoko, the nightly build.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.156
I tried looking in the preferences to control this but they weren’t in there.

00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:09.573
Then I remembered about:config.

00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:14.889
To get the twist thing back, type “about:config” into the address bar.

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:24.579
Then find the settings that say “browser.gesture.twist” The setting for “browser.gesture.twist.left” should be “Browser:PrevTab”Â and the one for .

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.796
right should be “Browser:NextTab” like so:

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:32.312
Voila! Your twisty tab changing gestures will be back!
