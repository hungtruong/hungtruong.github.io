New Threadless Shirts. And Songs About Them!?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.020
This week at Threadless.com , there’s only one shirt that I would (maybe possibly could) buy.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.280
So why am I writing anything?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.020
Because there’s songs along with the shirts!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.640
Yeah, that’s right!

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.380
Every new shirt (but one) has a short song composed about that shirt on the shirt’s page.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.200
Pretty weird and cool at the same time.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.440
I like “Why Did The Chicken Cross Abbey Road…?” and that’s about it.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.980
It’s a cute shirt, but I won’t buy it for $15.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.760
Perhaps if the song was more catchy… Maybe next week they’ll have better shirts (and songs)…
