I Need Your Help! Which Glasses Should I Get!?

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on June 20, 2006.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.180
That’s right, it’s almost time for my once every two years eye checkup.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.000
And plus I get to buy new glasses frames!

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.620
Usually this process takes me forever to decide.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.400
Before, I had gone with rectangly square glasses.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.340
Last time, I moved up to semi-rimless (on the top) glasses.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.460
This year, I’m not sure.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.800
I was thinking of getting totally rimless glasses, so that it doesn’t look like I’m wearing glasses at all!

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.620
But thick black frame glasses are kinda cool, and make you look like a hipster.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.360
But that might be a bad thing!

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.800
So here’s the deal, I used this weird online try on glasses thingamajig, and got screencaps.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.500
It worked fairly well, and you can sorta get the idea of how glasses will look on my head once worn.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.040
So help me decide!

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.140
Here’s the categories:

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.340
Emo

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.360
Yeah, they’re kinda not trendy and kinda lame now.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.500
Or are they?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.400
Here’s a bunch of the cool thick framed glasses that the guy from Weezer likes to wear:

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.040
Round

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.580
Round glasses generally look bad on my face.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.760
Incidentally, there are John Lennon glasses that are made by… John Lennon!

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.100
He has his own glasses company!

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.000
Crazy! These types of glasses generally make me look like Asian Harry Potter.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.620
Which is bad.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.180
Square

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.480
Square glasses look fairly okay on my head, because my head is rectangly.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.860
Or something like that.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.680
Here’s some fully framed square glasses.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440
Semi-Rimless: Top

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.020
These are the kind I have right now.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.160
There’s a rim on top, and no rim on bottom.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.220
Personally, I think it still kinda looks weird.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.140
Semi-Rimless: Bottom

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.600
Typically, the only people who can pull off the bottom-rimmed glasses are to be found in anime.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.860
But hey, they were there so I tried a few on my e-face.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.060
Totally Rimless

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.960
I was thinking of getting these kind.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.020
They make you look like you’re almost not wearing glasses at all!

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.960
But then what’s the point?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.940
I dunno. But they seem cool to me.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.140
Bad Glasses

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.840
Okay, so this isn’t a voting choice, but I thought I’d highlight some of the really bad looking frames that I found.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.780
These are mostly aviators and ladies’ looking glasses.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.200
I told ‘em I was a guy!

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.000
Here’s a picture of me without glasses, just in case you want to vote for that choice (not there’s a chance in hell that I’ll get contacts!).

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.040
Anyway, the deadline is pretty soon (like tomorrow is my appointment) so vote early!

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.740
If there’s a particular set of frames you find alluring, let me know in the comments section!

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.720
