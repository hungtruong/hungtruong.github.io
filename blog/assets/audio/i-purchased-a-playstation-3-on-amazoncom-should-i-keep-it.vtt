I Purchased A Playstation 3 on Amazon.com: Should I Keep It?

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.940

On Friday, Amazon.com had some kind of promotion where they picked a random time to take orders for the Wii and Playstation 3 .

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.360
I was around when the Playstation 3 went live on the site, so I picked up a 20gb PS3.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.020
I should be getting it some time next week.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.260
The question now is whether I should keep it to play, or resell it on ebay.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.680
The ebay prices have been falling steadily, and I have a feeling it might be a risk to put it on ebay.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.940
On the other hand, I don’t really want the 20gb PS3 right now.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680
I’d be pretty happy with a Wii, though.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.880
If I think I can make a profit, I’ll probably just put the thing on ebay.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:58.860
I don’t think it’s too readily available yet, and if I can make a quick $100 profit from taking a box to the post office, that doesn’t sound like a bad idea to me…
