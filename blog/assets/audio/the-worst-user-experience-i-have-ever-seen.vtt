The Worst User Experience I Have Ever Seen

For some reason Chase “upgraded” my card to some random blah thing instead of my Freedom something something.

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.747
That’s not the point of this post.

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:18.843
The point is that I was looking at the ways I can redeem my bonus points.

00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:23.099
There’s a way you can “pay yourself back” for a previous purchase you made.

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.854
It’s pretty obvious the people who handle Chase’s rewards site are total hacks.

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:31.391
They want you to type in the purchase date and price of something you bought .

00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:32.690
Think about that.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.546
You have to go grab your statement, find the date, find the price.

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:38.724
Then you insert it by hand.

00:00:39.224 --> 00:00:44.818
WTF? No interface to see what you’ve bought that is eligible for redemption?

00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:48.195
It’s like they don’t want you to redeem your points. Oh. Wait.

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:52.871
I titled this post “The Worst User Experience I Have Ever Seen.”

00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:56.248
But I don’t think this even counts as an experience.

00:00:56.748 --> 00:00:59.305
It’s more like a total disregard for usability.
