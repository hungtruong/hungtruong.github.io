Wii Fit: One Month Later

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.580
Published on June 21, 2008.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.940
I’ve been “playing” Wii Fit for about a month now, so I thought I’d put up some updates on how it’s been coming along.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.980
There have been some weird things happening occasionally when I play.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.960
For example, when I start up, the trainer will randomly be the dude (who has a slight Southern accent) and he’ll be like, “I’m filling in for your regular trainer today.”

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.300
What gives? I need some eye candy while I exercise, not some dude!

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.860
Also, one day I got all the way through my workout and went to do the plank thing.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.600
After doing the plank thing my time reset to :01 minutes.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.540
It basically erased all of the previous things I had done.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.120
Not that it really matters.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.140
It didn’t erase the calories I burned (OR DID IT!).

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.060
As far as my health goes, I have lost a few pounds since starting, but not enough to reach my goal in time.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.280
So the game let me readjust my goal.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.660
I think previously I was trying to lose 5 lbs a week or something, which is kind of difficult.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.540
I’ve also noticed a marked improvement in my strength.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.200
All those push-ups and stuff paid off.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.380
Which is to say I can actually do some push-ups now when before I just collapsed under the weight of my torso.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.840
My posture is probably improving as well.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.440
So anyway, I think the fact that I have stuck with the Wii Fit stuff for a whole month is probably some kind of achievement.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.060
Maybe I’ll celebrate by eating a whole tub of ice cream.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.040
Oh wait, that WOULD erase all the work I’d done.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.580
Maybe I’ll just have some lowfat sorbet then…
