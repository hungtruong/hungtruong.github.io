I’m flyin’ to Michigan tomorrow morning to check out apartments.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.800
And, of course, these apartments were found using MapsKrieg .

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.340
Hopefully I can find one that doesn’t have too slummy a slumlord.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.920
Or better yet, not a slumlord!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.360
I might check out other random attractions too, like Pinball Pete’s , which is apparently a huge ass arcade!

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.240
Luckily I’ll have something to do on the plane, since I just bought Pokemon Pearl yesterday.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.100
And if my batteries run out, I can practice showing people where Ann Arbor is in Michigan by pointing to my hand!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.520
I gotta get that down ASAP.
