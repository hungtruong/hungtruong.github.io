Wii Fit Update

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.180
Published on June 10, 2008.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.220
I’ve been “playing” this Wii Fit thing for about two weeks now.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.280
So far I’ve lost a few pounds and I think I’m probably quite a bit more “fit” than I was before.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.780
I guess the most remarkable fact is that I’m still at it after a few weeks.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.960
I’ve already pretty much unlocked everything in the game, so I just go through the normal exercises in my routine.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.100
It’d be cool if new exercises were to show up as downloadable content or something.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.500
I’ve been feeling pretty good lately as well.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.720
Besides the major pain factor of the “plank” exercise, most of the stuff isn’t too bad.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.020
I think I’ve already been building muscle, and now the actual weight loss might begin to show.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.760
I’m also trying to eat less.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.980
“Normal” portions in the US are way too big, so I’ve been trying to get small stuff for lunch and share things when possible.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200
It seems to be having a positive effect.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.320
I also seem to be more flexible during the yoga stuff.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.300
Who knows if I’m doing it right, but the Tree thing is a lot easier for me to do (and my foot actually can go up that high now).

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.060
I’d like to get a Wii and Wii Fit for my parents since they’d probably enjoy doing the exercises and could probably use the exercise themselves.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.480
Too bad it costs a bunch and the equipment is still in high demand and short supply.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:35.340
Overall I’d say the product is pretty sweet, and if you have enough self-motivation paired with the game’s motivation (it says stuff like, “I see you were too busy to exercise last night…” when you miss a day) you can easily live a healthier lifestyle.
