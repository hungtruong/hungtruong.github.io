Mostly because of this post , where he tells you what the programming interviewer is really thinking when he’s asking you how to find a cycle in a singly-linked list.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.060
What The Interviewer Thinks: This job has nothing to do with linked lists.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.800
In fact, I don’t think anyone has used a singly liked list since the seventies.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:37.540
I wonder if you’re good at PHP and MySQL, because that’s what all the work is here, but I’m not going to ask you anything about actual job requirements, because that doesn’t afford me the opportunity to be pathologically pedantic.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.660
Seriously, did he read my earlier post where I hated on the exact Amazon.com interviewer that he’s describing in his post?

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.780
Ted Dzubia should seriously be named the patron saint of computer science nerds instead of this guy .

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.400
He says what we think and some people actually listen to him!

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.720
PS, I just noticed I used the double equals (==) twice in a row on this blog.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.620
Hmm. Maybe I should come up with better headlines.
