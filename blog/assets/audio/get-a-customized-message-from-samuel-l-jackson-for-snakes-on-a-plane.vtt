Get A Customized Message From Samuel L Jackson! For Snakes on a Plane!

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.620
Published on August 04, 2006.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.460
I saw this on anandtech, and I’m pretty sure it’ll be everywhere soon.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.520
It’s a promotional thing for Snakes on a Plane.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.540
You give it some information and Samuel L. Jackson can either call or email a friend with a message saying that they have to watch Snakes on a Plane.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.040
It’s pretty entertaining hearing SLJ go insane about a movie starring himself.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.360
Here’s one that I made using a fictional “Samuel” and his copilot “Johnny.” [audio:Snakes on a Plane.mp3]

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.520
It actually sounds pretty good for being one of those cut and paste customized messages.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.860
Mr. Jackson is very convincing, and I’m kinda scared that he’ll kill me if I don’t see Snakes on a Plane.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.000
This is pure genius viral marketing, right here.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.900
The only complaint I have is that SLJ doesn’t know how to say a lot of names.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:05.040
Including “Hung.” Oh, I guess it would’ve been cool if he had dropped the F-bomb a few times, or even if he just said “ass” instead of “butt.”

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.160
Oh, if you didn’t know, Snakes on a Plane is a movie.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.820
About snakes. On a plane.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.320
And Samuel L. Jackson’s in it.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.780
It’s already gained cult status for having a cheesy plot.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.920
I read somewhere that Samuel L. Jackson only agreed to do the movie because of the title.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.580
Now that’s what I call quality cinema.
