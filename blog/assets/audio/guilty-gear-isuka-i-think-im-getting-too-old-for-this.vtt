Guilty Gear Isuka: I Think I’m Getting Too Old For This…

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.060
Published on March 25, 2006.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:18.420
So today I decided to take a somewhat dusty, unopened version of Guilty Gear Isuka (that I bought from Amazon.com for $10) off the shelf and actually play it!

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.000
I’m something of a crazy game buyer (I buy them when they’re cheap), and I have way too many to actually play them all.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.180
Anyway, I popped it into my PS2 and was immediately confused.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.820
Guilty Gear Isuka is a sprite-based fighter, kind of like Street Fighter 2.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.000
It’s also probably one of the last in a dying breed of games.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.900
This Guilty Gear is actually the first one I’ve ever played (though I’ve seen it being played in the Genshiken anime!).

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.080
The graphics are top notch, and the cool factor is definitely there.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.160
I figured, “if it’s cool enough for hardcore otaku, it’s cool enough for me!”

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.020
I think I’m getting old.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.320
Sure, the moves are all fireball/hold back forward type moves, but there’s other complicated things built in.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.100
The game supports 4 players at once, which is kinda cool, but that means you have to do your own turning.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.940
Also, I found that in the middle of a battle, the game’ll say something like “Joker has appeared!” and throw you into a two on one battle.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.520
Totally not fair!

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.940
I have a feeling that in my youth, I’d have probably spent more time on this game (memorizing moves, continuing a billion times after dying), but I just don’t have it in me anymore.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.340
Give me my tried and true Tekken fighting style, and I’ll get Heihachi on your ass!
