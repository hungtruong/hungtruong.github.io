Orange Juice Snobbery

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.420
Published on November 02, 2007.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.260
So since I’ve been living alone, I’ve been buying groceries for myself.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.560
One thing I’ve been drinking more of is orange juice.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.700
I’m not quite sure why; probably because I think that if I drink high volumes of the stuff, I’ll be healthier than if I don’t.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.560
And it’s sort of worked.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.740
I think pretty much everyone in Michigan is currently sick except for me.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.540
On my weekly grocery run, I always make sure to grab at least two things of orange juice.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.680
I go through two in a week, and sometimes more.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.700
I think a 2-2-3 pattern works out nicely.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.160
Typically I just buy what’s on sale at Meijer.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.260
So far, I’ve had pretty much all brands of orange juice available.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.560
There’s Minute Maid, Tropicana, Simply Orange, Meijer brand…

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.480
In short, I’ve become somewhat of an orange juice connoisseur.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.800
I never could make the distinction before between “from concentrate” and not.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.060
These days, “not from concentrate” is equal to “tastes like crap.”

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.640
I’m drinking some Meijer from concentrate orange juice as I write this, and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.060
1) It tastes pretty bad,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.360
2) I think it’s giving me heartburn.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.880
Aside from the concentrate issue, we have things like pulp density, added vitamins, etc.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.900
There was one version of Minute Maid I bought that had some kind of weird joint drug in it… Needless to say my joints were feeling great after I drank it.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.800
Perhaps this is due to some placebo effect.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.820
Or perhaps it’s due to the fact that I’m not quite old yet.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.140
Also, there exist orange juices with an added “Omega-3” ingredient.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.240
Apparently this is good for you.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.060
But you get this ingredient from fish.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.480
Yeah, orange juice with fish in it.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.620
Not my idea of a tasty breakfast beverage.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.720
Incidentally, I think my multivitamin also has this fish stuff added.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.460
But I just swallow that whole.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.240
I guess it’s still gross, just somewhat less so.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.760
But let’s keep on track.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.140
I’m blogging about orange juice, goddamn it!

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.640
When I see OJ with added vitamins or minerals, I’ll probably go for that.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.860
Calcium is good, but normal is fine too.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.920
Last week, Tropicana was on sale.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.140
But they only had the “Low Acid” and “Healthy” versions.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.120
The “healthy” one apparently had half the sugar… I got the low acid one.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.780
And it tasted really damn good!

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.760
I have to wonder where the acid went after being extracted from my orange juice.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.820
I can only hope it was used for good, and not evil.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.340
Let’s get back to the pulp.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.560
I’ve been experimenting with pulp densities.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.860
So far, I’ve found that moderation is key; medium pulp works well.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.800
No pulp is just unnatural, and high pulp is just too chewy and hard to clean.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.060
Low pulp can be substituted if medium pulp is unavailable.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.280
The thing is, there’s no common pulp density measure between orange juice distributors.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.620
How high is high pulp?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.280
Only the juicers know for sure.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.220
I’ll continue experimenting with the pulp density levels until I reach, with a high confidence level, a consensus on my preference.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.220
Due to cost and time issues, I have not yet ventured into the business of “home brewing” my orange juice.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.800
I think I’ll leave that job to the professionals.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:37.580
While there is something to be said about one who juices his own oranges, I cannot be bothered to perfect my skill in this particular craft.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.580
In conclusion, there is no clear winner as far as orange juice brands go.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.960
I’ve only bought single brands of orange juice each week.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.100
I can say that I like Simply Orange, Minute Maid, and Tropicana.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.720
I haven’t tried the more expensive Meijer version yet.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.060
Perhaps in the future I will try a double blind orange juice taste challenge.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.640
But for now, I’ll just buy what’s on sale.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.820
I hope it’s something good this week…
