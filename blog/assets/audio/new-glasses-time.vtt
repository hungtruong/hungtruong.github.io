New Glasses Time!

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.500
Published on August 13, 2008.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.220
I’ve been pretty lazy in doing appointment stuff.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.120
I just recently did my (somewhat) annual physical and optical checkups.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.180
With the optical one comes new glasses!

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.720
In the past I’ve had normal square frames, semi-rimless frames and then totally rimless.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:33.480
I don’t like the semi-rimless because it makes me look old, and the totally rimless one makes me look evil because the transitions effect in them never goes away (they’re always kinda tinted).

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.260
I wanted some thicker frames this time around but the plastic ones I tried on didn’t feel too great.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.520
So I ended up getting a pair of metal full frame glasses that are sorta dark green and have this weird temple design.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.000
The lady at the eye place was really cool and helped me try on a bunch of frames.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Many of them looked kind of girly or totally bad for my face.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.280
The lady definitely knew what was up with what worked and what didn’t.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.900
Unfortunately, the frames that I really liked cost a lot and weren’t included in my vision plan.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.680
I dunno if this was her ulterior motive or if she was just picking from all the stuff equally.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.180
She probably has some kind of incentive to pick more expensive frames; but she did suggest only the ones that I agreed looked good.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.300
Anyway, it went between two good frames but the green ones won in the end.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.600
If I can’t get a green DS or a green Wii, at least I can get green glasses.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.420
They should be ready in a few weeks.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.640
I’ll just pick them up right when school starts since I’ll be out of town for a while in the next few weeks.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.560
As a bonus, here are some funky frames I found that didn’t make the cut (but I didn’t bother taking pictures of the actual frames I ordered, whoops!):
