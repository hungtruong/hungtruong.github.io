This is a random post to see if I can get on top of the Google query for “MSI Candidate.”

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:17.943
My friend is currently on top (I won’t link to him, lest I sabotage myself).

00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:20.781
Maybe I should put some body text here.

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.199
Okay. I’m Hung Truong.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.855
I’m an MSI Candidate at the University of Michigan’s School of Information.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:30.033
Let’s see if that’s good enough.
