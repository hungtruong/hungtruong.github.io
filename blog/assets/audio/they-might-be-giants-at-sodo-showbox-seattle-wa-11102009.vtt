They Might Be Giants at SoDo Showbox, Seattle WA 11/10/2009

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:08.852
Published on November 11, 2009.

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:12.649
So I saw They Might Be Giants in concert last night.

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:19.782
This was a super special show where they played all of the songs from their album Flood plus some other songs as filler.

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:23.738
There was actually an opener called “Guggenheim Grotto.”

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:26.316
Their music wasn’t too bad.

00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:30.492
But it seemed really inappropriate as an opener to TMBG.

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:35.467
Like their songs were about love and pretty serious without any funny lyrics at all.

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:38.444
You could kind of tell the crowd was not into them.

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:42.460
I felt they should’ve had a more appropriate opener, but oh well.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.435
I guess there aren’t really a bunch of bands that are like TMBG and could open for them.

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:54.508
They didn’t actually go on stage til around 10pm, opening with some kind of song about elements.

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:58.365
I haven’t listened to their kid’s albums, so this one was new to me.

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:01.901
Then they did some other songs before launching into Flood.

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:11.272
Along the way they also did some weird puppet show, but it seemed like they had less random stage stuff than the last concert I saw , where they channeled a dead person or something.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:22.341
For the most part they played songs from Flood in sequence, though for some reason they rearranged Racist Friend and maybe also Particle Man. I think some of the fans were like “WTF” because of that.

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:27.077
Personally I’ve listened through Flood so many times that it seems like one giant song.

00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:30.294
So any break in the sequence is pretty noticeable.

00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:38.086
While I like the concept of playing a whole album for a concert (plus other songs), in practice it seems kind of absurd.

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:43.381
Some songs just don’t make sense live, like Hearing Aid or Minimum Wage.

00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:47.477
But in the spirit of experimentation and randomness I can accept it.

00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:52.452
While Flood is a really good album, I would’ve liked to hear more songs from other albums, too.

00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:55.429
They did play She’s An Angel, which was cool.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:03.841
And Famous Polka, The Mesopotamians (which I guess they use a lot as a pseudo closer), Shoehorn With Teeth and Why Does The Sun Shine?

00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:06.418
But what about Ana Ng and Don’t Let’s Start?

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.555
I guess you can’t fit all their songs into one concert…

00:02:10.555 --> 00:02:17.108
As with the last time I saw them (almost exactly two years ago to the date!), TMBG is really good live.

00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:21.684
Some of the Flood songs seemed a bit under-rehearsed, but besides that they were good.

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:26.419
Linnell sang a wrong lyric in Letterbox and I think everyone noticed.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:37.148
Also, random thought of the concert: “Is it weird that there is a giant room of people all singing along to a song about buying prosthetic foreheads to wear on their real heads? I guess not.”

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:43.582
Also similar to last time, the band left, then came back for two or three songs, then left again.

00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:47.119
At this point I was really tired and started walking off.

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.936
But then they did a second encore!

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.434
That’s how you know they’re professionals.

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:59.966
I just hope they don’t push it so much that each song requires an additional encore, starting from the first song played.

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:01.985
That would get tiring.

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:08.718
The last song they did was Fingertips from Apollo 18, which I think they also did the previous concert I saw.

00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:10.496
It’s a crowd-pleaser.

00:03:11.496 --> 00:03:14.853
Hopefully I will get to see They Might Be Giants again some time.

00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:20.307
They really are fantastic live (especially Linnell’s piercing voice) and really fun, too.
