Introducing Notecentric: Facebook Edition!

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on August 05, 2007.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.340
So about a year ago I unveiled my killer web app, Notecentric.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.440
It was an online note taking app that I used in class.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:25.260
And I was about the only person who used it… Well, this Summer Facebook opened up their website to third party applications, and I immediately thought of Notecentric.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.500
I haven’t really had much free time this Summer, though.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.720
I’ve been tele-working for a company during the day.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.900
But I found some time this weekend and last weekend to get a working version of Notecentric up on Facebook.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.140
It really didn’t take much time since I had already done Notecentric once before.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.800
This was just sort of an adaptation, though Facebook has its own weird things to learn. Like redirects.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.680
Anyway, check out and install the Notecentric app .

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.420
Once I get 5 users, I can apply for Notecentric to be in the official directory!

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.440
So hopefully that’ll be soon.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.180
I’m planning on adding more functionality as time permits, but for now, it’s totally working. I think.
