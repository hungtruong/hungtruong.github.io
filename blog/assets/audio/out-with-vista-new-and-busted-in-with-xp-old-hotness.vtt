That’s right! After having been screwed by Vista for the last time (incompatibility with Nero 5 OEM, which would require an unnecessary “upgrade” to Nero 8, and the inability for Vista to share its printer with other XP computers), I’m switching back to XP.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.960
And by that, I mean I’m switching my mom back to XP.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.880
So long, Vista!

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.220
I hope you die in a fire!
