They Might Be Giants: The Else – CD Review!

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.700
Published on November 13, 2007.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.500
Whoa, so I just got The Else in the mail.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And just in time, since the TMBG concert is tomorrow night!

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.460
I had gotten psyched for it this weekend by watching the TMBG documentary, Gigantic.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.120
I guess I could’ve written about it too.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.220
Maybe I will later.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.680
But this is a review of the new(ish) CD! Tracks:

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.000
1. I’m Impressed

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.200
I think They Might Be Giants is trying to trick reviewers into giving good reviews of the CD by calling their first song “I’m Impressed.”

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.660
And either by cognitive osmosis or pure wordplay, the reviewer will somehow work in the phrase into his/her review.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.200
This is a Linnell song, apparently.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.380
I just assume that whoever sings the song is the person who wrote it.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.100
Umm… The actual song seems to be about a guy who’s impressed by natural disasters (like plane crashes and Godzilla attacks).

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.880
But he’s also scared.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.700
I guess I’d give it a solid 7?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.560
Maybe a 6.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.640
2. Take Out The Trash

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.880
This is a Flansburgh song.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.940
He’s petitioning for a girl to dump some dude.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.120
And it’s Thursday now.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.880
The song’s not particularly melodic, instead featuring Flansburgh’s trademark “Olive Oyl-like singing.”

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620
It’s nothing special. 5?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.460
3. Upside Down Frown

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.300
This may be the best song of the album.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.760
It’s a Linnell.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
There’s this crazy frantic drumbeat underneath the calm guitar strumming.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.560
I like it!

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.360
Like all good TMBG songs, this one’s meaning can be left to interpretation.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.380
I think it’s about some dude getting dumped who seems happy about it.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.960
I guess he’s taken the oft-given advice to turn his frown upside down.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.780
The only problem is that obviously sad people who are smiling seem kinda sinister/crazy… I give it a 9!

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.100
4. Climbing The Walls

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.700
This is a song about a dude who is way too high strung.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.240
But he’s found a good outlet for it: climbing the walls.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.420
I think that’s merely metaphorical, but what do I know?

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.340
This is a fairly typical Linnell song.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.760
By which I mean it’s really repetitive, except when we get a refreshing bridge!

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.620
Like most Linnell songs, this one’s incredibly melodic.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.920
It’d work just as well without any backing at all.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.180
Which I think is a mark of a good song.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.520
Best line of the album: “I was grinding my teeth / I was wasting my youth / And using up my teeth.”

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.860
I’ll give it a 7.5.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.940
5. Careful What You Pack

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.140
Okay, this is the “Flansburgh sings like a girl” song of the album.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.380
This song doesn’t make any sense, and it’s not fun to listen to. 3.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.860
6. The Cap’m

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.260
Is this song about Captain Crunch?

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.800
No. It’s about a guy who likes to be called the “Cap’m.”

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.420
Apparently people think you can’t be called that unless you drive a boat.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.500
There’s nothing really striking about this song.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.080
It’s musical filler.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.060
It sounds like it was written in less than an hour.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.400
Which is bad, in this case.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.220
Especially given this is a Linnell song.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.000
I’d give it a 5.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.840
7. With The Dark

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.360
John Flansburgh sings some harmony with himself in this song.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.020
But I think they’re questionable harmonies.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.440
At least this one’s sort of funky (by which I mean, there are some funky horns)!

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.640
There’s some nautical elements in this song, which make me think it might fit in with The Cap’m?

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.460
The song is just all over the place though.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.760
I don’t like stupid all over the place songs!!! It seriously feels like they’re just making shit up as they go. 3.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.600
8. The Shadow Government

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.520
Okay, so this song’s a little more cohesive and maybe even rockin’.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.740
It’s still a little random though (in the bad way).

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.920
It uses the the quote “I doth protest,” though, so I can’t give it too bad of a score. 5?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.760
9. Bee Of The Bird Of The Moth

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.520
This song is fucking weird.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.980
Which is good.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.960
Subject: Hummingbird moth who’s acting like a bird that thinks it’s a bee.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.300
The lyrics are really mind-numbing.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.080
A Linnell song, it’s once again fairly repetitive.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.100
But the funkyness and strange lyrics sort of redeem this song.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.800
I give it a 7.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.120
10. Withered Hope

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.360
This song is all about the buildup.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.260
It starts off soft, giving some exposition of sad sack and withered hope.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.840
I guess they’re characters, and not just anthropomorphic emotions.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.540
As the plot is revealed, the song really ramps up!

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.360
And by plot, I mean new characters such as “soul mate,” “crook” and “motorbike” are added.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.860
It’s sort of a love pentangle.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.060
The whole song is weird and great. 8.5!

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.220
11. Contrecoup

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.180
Contrecoup had a lot of words that I had to look up.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.200
Which makes it good?

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:32.300
Apparently this dude is too obsessed with science, including phrenology (analyzing a person’s character from their head shape) the science of being in love (Limerence!).

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.280
He was hit in the head, which made him fall in love.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.620
Or something. Maybe he’s just a hypochondriac. Of love.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.100
I like the idea, but the song itself (as a song) really isn’t that great. 6.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.780
12. Feign Amnesia

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.820
Feigning amnesia is a pretty good coping mechanism.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.120
What this dude is coping with, I’m not quite sure.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.780
It’s probably one of the better Flansburgh songs.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.000
But that’s not saying much. 5.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.480
13. The Mesopotamians

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.120
People think the Mesopotamians died out or something.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.860
In fact, they just started a traveling band.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.580
This song is sort of like “We’re the Replacements” except with a dead civilization.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.480
It also sorta reminds me of those “band songs” where the bands sing about what they’re all about.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.100
Like “The Monkees.”

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.000
It gets cleverness points, along with some “I guess it’s not a bad song” points.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.700
I’ll give it a 7.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.140
Hmm. So the trend of me liking the Linnell songs and not liking the Flansburgh songs continues.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.280
I don’t really like any of the Flan songs, though most of the Linnell songs are at least decent.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.140
There’s probably 3-4 songs that I like on this new album.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:53.960
That’s still not very good, but it’s better than the 2 songs I liked on The Spine and the 0 songs I liked from Mink Car.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.600
I had heard that this album was the best TMBG has released since Apollo 18.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.820
It probably is, but that’s not really saying much.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.560
I guess it’s nice that they’re slowly getting “better” since having hit rock bottom with Mink Car.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.820
I’m still waiting for State Songs Vol.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.360
2 from Linnell…

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.960
Hopefully they’ll play some “classics” (She’s an Angel, Don’t Let’s Start, etc) at the concert tomorrow.
