Baldur’s Gate II: Like Crack, But A Computer Game Version

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.620
Published on June 27, 2008.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.260
I reinstalled Baldur’s Gate II today.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.400
Bad idea. I’ve been sort of nostalgic for the past glory of the turn-based RPG and I finally just had to play it.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.980
But I pretty much didn’t get anything else done.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.820
I don’t care what anyone says; old school 2D D&D games like Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale and Torment rock.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.400
They’re just too damn fun to play.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.340
I don’t know what it is.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.520
Maybe it’s how your enemies explode into chunks if you hit them hard enough.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.860
Maybe it’s how Magic Missile grows more powerful as you gain levels.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.280
Maybe it’s the actual role-playing.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.040
But once I start one of these old school adventures I can’t stop until hunger or weariness takes priority.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.460
Which is just about to happen.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.040
But I thought I’d blog about it first.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.980
(I guess Baldur’s Gate is then a sort of offline equivalent of World of Warcraft, which I never really got myself dependent on, thank god)

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.860
I tried playing Mass Effect kind of recently.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.680
It just doesn’t have the same fun factor.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.180
I mean, what kind of RPG expects me to actually aim a gun?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.600
The KOTOR games at least handled all the blaster shots and stuff.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.460
Why does everything have to degenerate into FPS?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:36.520
Oh well. I still never beat any of the Baldur’s Gate or Icewind Dale games (or Torment) so I guess if I ever run into a period where I have a lot of free time (probably will never happen) I’ll have plenty of things to do.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.040
P.S. This time I rolled a Half-Elf Chaotic Good multi-classed Fighter/Cleric.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.820
Usually I go for the Ranger but I found they kind of suck.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.520
A vanilla Fighter would be too boring so I multiclassed!

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.060
I’m a nerd!
