Thoughts on Spotify

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:05.096
Published on July 19, 2011.

00:00:06.096 --> 00:00:16.565
I was lucky enough to get an early invite to Spotify last week thanks to my high Klout score (I honestly think anyone with a pulse got an invite) and I’ve been playing around with it for a few days.

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:19.782
Here’s my thoughts on the service thus far.

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:26.456
One thing I’ve noticed is that I’m using Spotify for listening to stuff that I don’t already have in my library.

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:33.029
This is sort of weird because I recently switched to an SSD and none of my music is actually in my library.

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:39.603
Yet I use Spotify for listening to stuff that’s not on my external hard drive (which I almost never have plugged in).

00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:46.895
I think this behavior might be due to the fact that Spotify is making me a fat kid in a candy store (but for music).

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:52.190
I want to keep searching to test Spotify’s limits and see how much music it really has.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.688
So far it’s been doing really well.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:01:03.599
Specifically, I have been using Spotify mostly to listen to music that was popular when I was in middle school (this was like, 14 years ago).

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:09.853
This music is stuff that I’m either too embarrassed to have on my hard drive, or I simply never had.

00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:12.830
Yet it’s totally great for nostalgia’s sake.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.924
I’ve been listening to No Doubt, Toni Braxton, Weezer, Mariah Carey, etc.

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:21.582
Stuff that brings me back to that era.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.120
It’s pretty cool.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.632
One workflow that Spotify has replaced for me is the awkward one of going to YouTube and looking for a video of a song I want to hear.

00:01:32.132 --> 00:01:41.802
I don’t know how many times I’ve had to go to YouTube and searched for something like “ Head Over Heels ” by Tears For Fears just to listen to a song (it’s just a static image of the album cover).

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:46.617
It’s much, much quicker just to search in Spotify and get super instant gratification.

00:01:47.617 --> 00:01:52.732
Comparisons to the new hot startup, Turntable , are pretty much impossible to avoid.

00:01:53.232 --> 00:02:03.062
Turntable is really fun for interacting with people (and music discovery), but sometimes you just want to listen to what you want to listen to (and not wait for other DJs before your song comes on).

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:08.117
I think the two services have very different use cases, and each works well for its intended use.

00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:12.553
One thing Spotify could work on is music discovery.

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:18.247
It’s kind of ridiculous the only music it pushes are the top albums, artists and songs.

00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:28.337
All the stuff on this list are top 20 bullshit that I really have no interest in listening to (just ignore the top 20 “bullshit” from the 90’s that I just admitted to listening to).

00:02:28.837 --> 00:02:34.910
In this day and age, it’s ridiculous for a music service to not include some kind of recommendation engine or radio feature.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.445
Browsing music on the service by genre, year or anything besides search is impossible.

00:02:40.945 --> 00:02:44.461
In terms of features, Spotify is actually kind of disappointing.

00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:49.616
Despite the obvious shortcomings, I have a lot of high hopes for Spotify.

00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:55.470
It’s a really nice example of how consumers can enjoy getting stuff from “the cloud” without making it too complicated.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.404
I hope that it continues to improve, especially in the music discovery and browsing categories.
