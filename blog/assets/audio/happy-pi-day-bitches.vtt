Happy Pi Day, Bitches!

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.740
Today is Pi Day , or 3-14, so in honor of such an occasion, I’m eating pie.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.520
Also on my schedule is memorizing more digits of pi.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.660
Sadly enough, even though I’m a Computer Science major, I only know pi up to 3.14159.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.040
Yeah, I know, how can I call myself a nerd?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.040
Luckily for me, there’s the Pi Trainer .

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.900
It lets you guess pi, tells you how many digits you got right, and gives you 5 more digits to remember.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.320
This process continues until you memorize all of pi, or give up.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.340
I chose the latter.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600
It’s a good way to spend your Pi Day.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.860
Holy shit, that rhymed!
