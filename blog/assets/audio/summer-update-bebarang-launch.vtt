Summer Update: Bebarang Launch!

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.295
Published on August 13, 2011.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:11.290
It’s been a while since I’ve posted on my blog; I’ve been super busy with my startup!

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.825
We finally ended up launching the latest iteration of the site, Bebarang , last week.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:20.121
It’s currently by no means perfect, but what site is?

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.478
We “pivoted” from a subscription model to a one time use model.

00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:29.293
Whether this will work remains to be seen, but we’re definitely learning a lot.

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:36.506
If you are a parent or know a parent, please forward the site around and let me know what you think about the concept and the product!

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:41.741
Also, New York is finally cooling down a bit after a crazy hot summer.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.638
It’s starting to get really beautiful outside.

00:00:45.138 --> 00:00:49.853
Maybe we can start working in the park once we’re kicked out of our workspace at NYU…
