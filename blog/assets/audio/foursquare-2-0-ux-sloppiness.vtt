foursquare 2.0 UX Sloppiness

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.534
Published on September 20, 2010.

00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:10.731
Foursquare just released a new version of its iPhone app .

00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:20.282
Something I noticed right away which disappointed me was that they basically slapped on a new view to the existing app, and didn’t even bother to match the style of the original app!

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:26.636
Not only is the new bar a different color, it’s also a different height than the existing one!

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:31.691
It also lacks labels where the original one has labels below the icons.

00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:34.348
This is simply sloppy design.

00:00:34.848 --> 00:00:37.885
These two screens exist in the same version of their app!

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:45.257
It wouldn’t have taken much more work to either update the app so both bars are grey, or match the new views to the old one.

00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:50.812
I recently saw that foursquare is looking for a new Product Manager .

00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:54.908
I’m considering applying to help them out with their product issues 🙂

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:56.388
EDIT:

00:00:57.388 --> 00:01:08.097
After emailing back and forth with Alex Rainert, foursquare’s head of product, it seems that, to answer my own question, this was a conscious design decision to change the visual style of the buttons.

00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:15.469
In one context, they are for navigating various top level features, and in another, they are buttons for various pop-up actions.

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:26.678
It’s of my opinion that the change in visual style is a bit too much (the change in height along with the loss of the location footer in some screens), but that’s a design choice that foursquare made intentionally.
