Song Currently Stuck in My Head: Ladies of The World

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.740
Published on July 04, 2008.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.660
I’ve been watching Flight of The Conchords due to numerous people liking them.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.200
Also, I saw them live in Ann Arbor some time in May.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.980
They’re pretty funny.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.180
Anyway, most of their songs are kind of the type that wouldn’t be that great, except that they have jokes in them.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.400
Honestly, if the songs weren’t funny as well, they wouldn’t have as much sticking power, I think.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.720
There’s one song that shows up later in the first season called “Ladies of The World.”

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.820
I think it’s the real deal.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.920
And it’s currently stuck in my head.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.660
The way the percussion lines up with the guitar and the crazy sexy bass line?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.840
Yeah, it’s the real deal.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.500
And I guess the lyrics are pretty funny, too.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.200
And the special music video… Okay, maybe it’s just because the song is funny.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.740
I don’t know anymore!

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.420
