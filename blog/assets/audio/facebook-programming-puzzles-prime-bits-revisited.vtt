Facebook Programming Puzzles – Prime Bits Revisited

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.940
Published on April 12, 2007.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.340
So I got a comment on my original post about the Facebook Programming Puzzle called “Prime Bits” that asked:

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.780
did you get this part ?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.160
Your implementation should have a running time faster than O(n), where n is b – a.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.060
id like to see how you solved it.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.860
I felt really stupid for not catching that part until I checked the Google cache of the page.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.880
Apparently Facebook added that requirement some time after April 2nd and, presumably, getting a lot of inefficient entries (mine included).

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:50.840
It’s also funny to note that if you look at the actual html, there’s a fun message hidden in comments that reads “with ‘efficient’ meaning whatever you think it ought to mean.”

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.660
Touché, facebook, touché.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.820
Off the top of my head, I can think of a way using dynamic programming to make the problem a lot more efficient.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.080
I’m not sure whether or not it’s just an amortization hack, or an actual better than O(n) implementation, technically.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.240
Okay, so I went ahead and coded up the dynamic programming version.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.380
The running time actually does increase at a less than O(n) rate, so I think it counts.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.080
Maybe I’ll plot out the running time growth for good measure.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.580
I believe it’s in the neighborhood of log(n).

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.560
I guess I’ll send this new version along with my resume again, and see if they’ll respond this time 🙂

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.400
Also, Rest in Peace, Facebook Guy.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.420
You’ll be sorely missed.
