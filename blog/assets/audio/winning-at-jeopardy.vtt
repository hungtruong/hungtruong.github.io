Winning at Jeopardy

00:00:02.858 --> 00:00:05.016
Published on December 12, 2012.

00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:12.409
I just had another dream that felt very real up to the moment when I checked my phone and realized I hadn’t won on Jeopardy.

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.985
I might need to start up a series on my blog about weird dreams if this keeps up.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:27.575
There was a news story on AnnArbor.com yesterday about a local Ann Arbor guy appearing on Jeopardy that I tweeted from my parody account, so that’s probably what fueled this weird dream.

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:32.650
For some reason I’m on the Jeopardy website, checking out the hall of fame.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.787
I vaguely recall having been on Jeopardy.

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:42.360
This is cool because my old friend Susan was always trying to get onto Jeopardy and now I can brag to her that I was on it.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.655
I investigate further and realize that not only did I appear, but I won!

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:52.950
My total winnings amounted to around $21,000 in June of 2011.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.726
At this point I’m wondering why I never got the check from Alex.

00:00:57.726 --> 00:01:04.039
The first thing I did was search for “jeopardy” in my gmail (this is also what I do in real life if I need to remember something).

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:11.412
This was harder than I expected, because spelling “jeopardy” in a dream is harder than in real life.

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:16.467
That only brought up two random emails, so I checked the hall of fame webpage again.

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:21.282
It listed that my email address on file was “ [email protected] .”

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:25.937
So apparently a typo was all that stood in the way of me and my prize money.

00:01:26.937 --> 00:01:36.927
The website had an email form to fill out (as well as a fax number) for corrections, etc. I didn’t really question why the public-facing website had so much information on it.

00:01:37.427 --> 00:01:49.734
As I raced to fill out my correct information “I regret to inform you that you have not paid me yet, and I am the Hung Truong who won back in 2011”, I woke up to the sobering reality that I was never a Jeopardy winner.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:52.732
That’s always the hardest moment.

00:01:53.232 --> 00:01:58.347
Realizing that you didn’t win at Jeopardy, don’t have an awesome dog, etc. sucks.

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:06.279
But I guess I can take consolation in the fact that today is a new day where literally anything is possible (except for winning at Jeopardy, obviously).
