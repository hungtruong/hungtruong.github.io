The Angry Birds Secondary Market

Published on July 12, 2010.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:10.811
So I was searching for Angry Birds on iTunes in order to get the link for it.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.347
I’ve already bought the game, and it’s an awesome one for $1.

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:20.222
I noticed that there are a number of “Angry Bird” apps, but only two of them are the original.

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:23.279
Angry Birds and the lite demo version.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.494
The others are all either cheat/walkthrough guides, or random knockoffs.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:34.348
The insane thing is that the price of the actual game is $1, and so are the knockoffs!

00:00:34.848 --> 00:00:41.561
You can buy the game for the same amount as an unauthorized guide, which has information freely that’s available online!

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:48.214
The craziest one is the app called “The Angry Bird,” which has an angry looking bird trying to kill worms or something.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:56.865
I am assuming all of these apps are legal under fair use and whatnot (if they’re only stating facts), yet something tells me they could be violating trademark rules…

00:00:57.865 --> 00:01:01.781
I wonder if other popular apps have this same kind of thing happening to them.

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:05.557
And I wonder if the developers of Angry Birds are bothered by it.

00:01:06.057 --> 00:01:11.811
If they got angry enough, they might be able to make a spinoff game called “Angry Developers of Angry Birds.”
