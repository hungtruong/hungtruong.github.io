00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
To Mac, or Not To Mac…

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.140
Published on May 22, 2006.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.940
That’s the question.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.080
Yep, I’m well into the Summer break, which means it’s time for me to start on projects that have been postponed due to school and whatnot.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.260
I’ve been learning Ruby on Rails, which is a really cool framework for building web applications.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.680
Okay, so I bet that last sentence made about 0 sense to many of you…

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.080
Anyway, as someone who is developing stuff for the internets, I should probably see how things are rendered in different browsers.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.980
Not everyone uses firefox, though they should (even if it eats all of your memory).

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.840
Since the new Macbooks came out, I’ve sorta wanted to get one, but it seems there’s still some issues. List time!

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.640
Pros:

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.320
Runs Mac OSX

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.160
Runs Windows XP

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.440
Runs Ubuntu Linux

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.040
Is fairly cool

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.160
Cons:

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.520
Is fairly hot

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.320
Thermal Paste = badly applied ?

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.400
Super shiny screen!

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.160
Has flaky paint job?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.800
Now, the Macbook has only been out for like, a week, and all these issues have been brought up?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.620
I could probably wait a little bit until they resolve all (or at least most) of these.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.500
I checked the student discount I get from UNM.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.080
Normal price is $1100, student price is $1070… Amazon.com has the Macbook for $1100 – $100 and no tax, so I’d probably get it there.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.900
I was gonna get a mac mini, but those cost $800 anyway, so I might as well get the laptop, right?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.320
Vote in the new poll: Mac?

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.260
and let me know your opinion.
