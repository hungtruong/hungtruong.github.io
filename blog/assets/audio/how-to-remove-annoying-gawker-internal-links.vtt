How To Remove Annoying Gawker Internal Links

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.340
Published on July 17, 2007.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580
I like a lot of the blogs on the Gawker network.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.040
Kotaku, Gizmodo, Lifehacker, and Valleywag are all blogs I read, with Valleywag being the one I must read everyday.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.980
One thing that infuriates me, however, is their use of “SEO” tricks to up their pageviews.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.640
Almost every article on the Gawker blogs will have links to “Posts tagged as” whatever, which links to a tag list.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.600
I noticed on the actual sites that they change the color of internal link to blend in, and the external links look like links.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.220
That’s good, except that I read the blogs in Google Reader.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.360
So an article ends up looking like this:

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.080
Holy Crap! 8 of the 12 links on that page are directed to a fucking tag list!

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.900
First of all, this is incredibly annoying.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.680
If a person clicks on a link entitled “Facebook” then maybe clicking on it should take them to FACEBOOK!!!

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.600
Second, linking to internal “search results” for SEO purposes is frowned upon by Google .

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.540
Of course, they’re not just doing this for the SEO, but also for crazy-insane inflated pageview stats.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.540
I was gonna write a greasemonkey script to remove the annoying links, but before I could, I found an existing one .

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.520
Unfortunately it doesn’t work in Google Reader.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.520
A lot of other blogs are starting to do this, and it’s really starting to annoy me.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.260
I’m sure others are annoyed too.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.800
Maybe if enough people complain, these sites will ditch the annoying SEO tactics.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.860
Maybe we should report their evil ways to Google?

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.580
If I do end up giving up reading Valleywag, at least there’s a better (yet less often updated) successor, Uncov .

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.760
Long live Uncov!
