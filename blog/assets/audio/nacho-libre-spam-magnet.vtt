Nacho Libre: Spam Magnet

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:07.014
Published on February 22, 2009.

00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:10.251
Maybe I’m on some kind of “spam roll” right now.

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:19.062
But after checking my spam bin in WordPress, I noticed that about 100% of my blogspam was directed towards an old post I made about Nacho Libre .

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:22.220
What makes the post a spam magnet, though?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.834
I didn’t really stick anything in there that would potentially make it a spam target for spammers, did I?

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:32.809
Is it because I mentioned some lady that looks like Penelope Cruz (but isn’t)?

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.127
I closed the comments on the post.

00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:40.303
My apologies to people who wanted to make a legit comment on the post but couldn’t.

00:00:40.803 --> 00:00:43.360
Maybe you can just post your comment here instead.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.814
Oh, crap. What if this post becomes the new Nacho Libre spam magnet post!?

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:53.789
I guess I’d have to close comments on this one and make a new one explaining it.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.563
Then that new one would become the next spam magnet, and I would have to continue the process ad infinitum.

00:01:00.063 --> 00:01:01.582
Hopefully that doesn’t happen.

00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:05.459
Update, 4-27-09:

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:10.934
I noticed this post is getting lots of spam now, so I’m closing comments.

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:14.390
Geez, what is it with Nacho Libre and SPAM!?
