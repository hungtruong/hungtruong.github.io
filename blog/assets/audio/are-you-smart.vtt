00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:28.434
I felt like trying out my new Yamaha Silent Brass and Sennheiser HD-280 Pro headphones from the Facebook contest, and since I haven’t recorded anything lately I figured I’d play some My Funny Valentine.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:36.606
The Aebersold track is fun and all, but playing with it makes me feel as though I’m playing as the accompaniment, rather than with the accompaniment.

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:40.382
So here’s a sans-backing version of My Funny Valentine.

00:00:41.382 --> 00:00:48.414
The sound quality came out okay, though the silent brass makes it sounds a bit stuffy and adds a lot of backpressure to the horn.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:52.830
But I guess it’s still better than playing without a mute and pissing off my neighbors.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.926
It works great for practicing; recording not so much.

00:00:57.426 --> 00:00:59.344
The headphones are also pretty sweet.

00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:01.442
I haven’t used them that much.

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:06.097
I mainly use them for listening to This American Life while doing dishes.

00:01:06.597 --> 00:01:09.234
They block outside sound pretty well.

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:14.230
Oh, and in case you’re wondering, yes, I stole stuff from Miles and Wynton.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.849
I hope they don’t mind.

(I’d like to think I’m more mature in my trumpet playing since 2 years ago)
