Google Opens Their Offices In Ann Arbor! Plus Google Vs Meetup!

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.700
Published on May 17, 2007.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.500
I saw on Valleywag that Google finally opened up their new office in Ann Arbor .

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.960
This is kinda cool, since I’m going to school in Ann Arbor in the Fall and it’ll be interesting having a Google office so nearby.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.700
Not that I’m going to stalk it or anything.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
I’ll be too busy with school and work!

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.820
Not that I would stalk it anyway… Moving on…

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.940
This office is only an Adwords office, which means that it’ll probably just be a bunch of sales people and not a lot of engineers, if any.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.360
Too bad. I’m sure they need engineers to run Adwords too, but who knows if they’ll put them in that office.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.320
I also read this funny comparison about why you should work at Meetup instead of at Google .

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.620
The document (made on Google Docs!) mainly tries to convince readers that working at Meetup is much cooler since it’s a startup.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.200
It seems like they push the “you’re a cog in the machine at Google” a bit too hard, though.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.620
There’s also the “Google infantilizes you” thing goin’ on too.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.760
Perhaps that’s true, but I for one welcome our Google parenting overlords!

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.960
I’m sure that document is all in good fun, anyway.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.380
At the end of the day, people are reminded of how awesome Google’s toilets are, and Meetup gets some free publicity.
