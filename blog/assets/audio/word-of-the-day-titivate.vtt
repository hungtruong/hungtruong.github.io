Word of the Day: titivate

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.060
Published on February 20, 2006.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.220
I really love it when they do potentially naughty sounding words for the Word of the Day.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.320
Today’s word of the day is:

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.360
titivate : to smarten up; to spruce.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.600
One of the examples they use is:

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.920
In The Idle Class , when Chaplin is titivating in a hotel room, the cloth on his dressing table rides up and down, caught in the same furious gusts.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.600
— Peter Conrad, Modern Times, Modern Places

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.320
Hmmm. Titivating in the hotel room huh?

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.060
When there’s free HBO and Cinemax, I guess that’s just natural.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.420
I’ll have to use titivate in my everyday vocabulary now to send improper messages to people.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
Other fun words that I like to use are: “ exacerbate ,” and “ titular .”

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.380
Go look ‘em up!

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.180
I’ll be around.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.840
Titivating in my bathroom, exacerbating in my room (knock before you come in!) and watching a titular actress in a movie.
