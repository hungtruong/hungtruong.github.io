Super Michael Jackson Brothers!

So quite randomly, I was reminded of this crazy flash animation starring Michael Jackson in Mario World.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.200
If you’re an old school gamer, you’ll remember Super Mario Brothers as well as the ill-fated Genesis game, Moonwalker, starring Michael Jackson himself.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.480
This animation just has Michael going through Super Mario Brothers using his own special skills.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.820
There are other crazier animations (with awesome music, BTW) that have him saving the world from a giant Zangief from SF2 that’s trying to drop kick it. No joke!

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.020
Mr. Michael Jackson sprite creator, I salute you.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.840
If it weren’t for your efforts, we wouldn’t have these insane flash animations to look at today.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.300
Your work will be remembered for decades into the future!
