I’ve been downloading some free songs from Amazon.com and I found this band called Of Montreal.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.080
They’re pretty good and they remind me of They Might Be Giants when they were poorer and better.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.260
Of Montreal is actually probably weirder than TMBG though.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:31.120
You could derive this just from the names of their songs, such as “Iras Brief Life as a Spider” and “Advice From A Divorced Gentleman To His Bachelor Friend Considering Marriage.”

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.700
Yeah. Anyway, check out their free MP3s at Amazon.com .

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.600
I should probably a CD of theirs, but I haven’t bought a CD in like, 5 years.
