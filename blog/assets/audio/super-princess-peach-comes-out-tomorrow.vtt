Super Princess Peach Comes Out Tomorrow!

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.860
Published on February 26, 2006.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.980
No, not out of the closet, out for Nintendo DS!

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.600
Now, I’m no girl, but I kinda really want to play this.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.660
It’s too bad Peach isn’t as hot in this game as she was in Mario Strikers (um, did I just say Peach was hot?!).

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.080
Princess Peach has an umbrella to whack enemies with, and she cries a lot.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.900
Must be that time of the month… I wonder if she can levitate like she could in Mario 2.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.920
That would be pretty cool!

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.880
Peach has to save Mario and Luigi, or something like that.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.500
I think this game is actually catered towards girls, because check out the official webpage .

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.880
It’s all… girly.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:51.260
There should be some kind of special feature in the game where if I sense someone approaching, it’ll turn into a super violent macho game or something!

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.860
This could be just the thing to keep me occupied until the new Super Mario Bros. comes out for the Nintendo DS.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.640
Then again, there’s also homework to keep me occupied.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.580
Speaking of which…
