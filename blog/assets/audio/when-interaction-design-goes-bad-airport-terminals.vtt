When Interaction Design Goes Bad: Airport Terminals

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:08.133
Published on January 07, 2011.

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:16.485
I recently flew into the Detroit airport McNamara Terminal, and I made an observation that most of my fellow travelers probably made as well.

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:22.099
That particular terminal consists of two long sides that branch out of the middle of the terminal.

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.953
Our flight taxied to just about the farthest you can possibly be from the exit of the airport.

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:35.566
Everyone had to walk across the furthest path (or take the tram) to get to the baggage claim and the airport exit. Why?

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:42.719
I read somewhere that airports used to get a lot of complaints about the baggage claim taking too long to get started.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.454
Travelers would have to wait at the carousel thing and probably got really bored.

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:53.548
To fix that, the airports would drop people off at further gates, making them walk further.

00:00:54.048 --> 00:01:00.121
This longer walk caused the “wait time” at the baggage claim to be shorter, and they got less complaints.

00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:03.898
Perhaps that’s what happened to me and my fellow travelers.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:09.692
I would argue that the particular “fix” I described probably shouldn’t be used anymore.

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:17.784
Since most airlines charge people to check in bags, I think many don’t even need to wait at the baggage claim anymore (myself included).

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:26.116
The fix is an interesting psychological trick, but it doesn’t actually buy anyone time, and it just makes me take longer to get out of the airport.

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:34.687
I’d argue that this is interaction design gone bad, but I don’t have a way to confirm that this strategy is the reason we were dropped off so far from the exit.

00:01:35.187 --> 00:01:43.658
The flight was getting in at 10:30 and we passed numerous free gates, so I can’t think of any other good reason (maybe to save the plane some fuel?).
