(In)Famous Hung Truongs Who Aren’t Me

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.540
Published on June 30, 2008.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.620
My friend Patrick sent me a link in an email about a news story.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.360
Sweet! I love seeing news about me!

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.500
But this Hung Truong was definitely not me:

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.700
The suspect, Hung Truong, 24, appeared in court Monday morning on a manslaughter charge.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.000
His bond was set at $50,000.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.740
Investigators said that the charge could be upgraded to intoxication manslaughter depending on the outcome of toxicology tests.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:43.920
Officers at the accident scene Sunday said Truong was nonchalant and at times laughing as if he were impaired by drugs or alcohol, or had a severe mental deficiency.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.720
C’mon, other Hung Truong!

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.540
You’re giving Hung Truongs like me a bad name!

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.480
Also, I happen to be 25 now, so there shouldn’t be any confusion as to which Hung Truong is the “bad” one!

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.680
Perusing Google News, I also dug up this recent story about a Canadian Hung Truong :

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.160
Hung Truong, 39, of Markham, faces charges of arson endangering life and production of a controlled substance.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.120
Seriously now! Aren’t there any other good Hung Truongs (besides me, of course) around to spread the good name(s) of Hung Truong!?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.180
I got us that WSJ article , but how much more can one Hung Truong do!?

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.020
Also, this sorta reminds me of a time way back, when a Google search for Hung Truong brought up this news article :

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.740
Last week, women from 13 different rooms told police a stranger entered their rooms while they were asleep early Sunday morning.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.400
Six women said the man climbed on them, pulled off their clothes or fondled them.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.040
Man, I’m glad I upped my Google PageRank !

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.040
Anyway, for anyone checking out my blog (like, for a job or something) and wondering, “is this the Hung Truong who was arrested for X?”

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.380
No. I’m the good Hung Truong!

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.200
Or perhaps I doth protest too much?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.160
