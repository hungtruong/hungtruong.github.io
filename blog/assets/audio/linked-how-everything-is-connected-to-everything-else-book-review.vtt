Linked: How Everything is Connected to Everything Else – Book Review

00:00:05.256 --> 00:00:07.653
Published on January 09, 2010.

00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:12.249
It looks like I’m continuing my long list of book reviews on my blog.

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:18.663
Here’s a review of Linked by Albert-László Barabási (yes, I copy-pasta’ed that).

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:25.976
Linked is the story of the birth of graph theory and how early network models evolved to how we understand them today.

00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:33.668
Barabasi does a really good job of inserting character and context into the early scientists that formed the early ideas about networks.

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:42.239
For example, he introduces Euler with a story about how he gave his nephew some lessons and worked on calculations that would some day lead to the discovery of Neptune.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.655
Oh, and he died that day, never to see the fruits of his labor.

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:53.788
This kind of narrative is what I found lacking in Connected , and the kind I also noticed in Six Degrees . Go Barabasi!

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.703
That isn’t to say that Barabasi isn’t the king of all prose.

00:00:59.203 --> 00:01:05.677
One bugaboo I kept running into while reading linked was that Barabasi seems to have a certain idiosyncrasy in his writing.

00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:09.772
To be blunt, he starts too many sentences with the word “indeed.”

00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:15.707
I’m not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but in some paragraphs he uses “indeed” twice!

00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:19.323
I think the max number on a page was three.

00:01:19.823 --> 00:01:24.298
I have taken the liberty of documenting one of these pages:

00:01:25.298 --> 00:01:29.613
Please note that this doesn’t mean I don’t like the book or Barabasi’s writing.

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:33.469
Indeed, I just complemented his writing earlier in this review.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.326
I just think his editor needs to help him with a larger vocabulary.

00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:42.161
Besides that pet peeve, I thought the book was really well written and interesting.

00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:48.655
It had my attention up to Barabasi’s discovery of scale-free networks and the near-ubiquity of them in other systems.

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:54.509
The book started getting a bit slow around the 13th chapter when the subjects were biology and business.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.205
I’m not sure if I was just scale-free fatigued or what.

00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:01.443
I feel the book was not balanced enough.

00:02:01.943 --> 00:02:09.775
The beginning, which consisted of a lot of history, was much more interesting than the explanations of how scale-free networks seemed to pop up everywhere.

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:19.385
While it is a key takeaway that many of these observed properties of networks seem to be universal, it also isn’t as interesting as evolving a model of network analysis.

00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:22.522
I guess this isn’t really a fault of the author though.

00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:29.974
Also, this book was published in 2002, before many of the popular social network websites became super popular.

00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:36.148
I just looked up Barabasi on Amazon and it appears he has a book due out this year . Sweet!

00:02:37.148 --> 00:02:41.463
I think that I can safely say that I enjoyed Duncan Watts’ book more than Linked.

00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:51.314
But it also isn’t a fair comparison because I read Watts’ book first and much of the content of both authors overlaps, so I may have felt that reading Linked was redundant.

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:57.487
Linked came before Six Degrees, so maybe a lot of Six Degrees’ success has to do with Barabasi’s book.

00:02:57.987 --> 00:02:59.985
Either way, both books were good.

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:02.403
I’m glad I read both of them.

00:03:02.903 --> 00:03:08.577
Now that I discovered the existence of a second Barabasi book, I can look forward to reading it in April.
