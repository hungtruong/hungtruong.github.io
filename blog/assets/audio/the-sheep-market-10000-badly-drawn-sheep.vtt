If you haven’t heard of the Amazon.com mechanical turk, it’s a weird way of getting paid to do human things.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:24.200
There are certain things that humans can do much better than computers (like identify street names and buildings), so Amazon.com pays you to do this stuff at a rate of like, 3 cents per thing you do.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.520
I used it a couple of times to earn like, $1 by identifying buildings before I got bored as hell and quit.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.740
Anyway, it looks like someone has finally put this to good use by hiring people to draw sheep facing left.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.520
10,000 of them!

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.700
I’m kinda disappointed that I didn’t know about this.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.440
I coulda been part of internet history!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940
And been paid 2 cents!

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.820
If you click on the little thumbnail, it actually shows you the strokes that it took to draw the sheep.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.040
Pretty cool. At 2 cents per sheep, the whole project cost $200.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.740
Not too bad, really.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.360
Where else are you gonna get 10,000 pictures of sheep ?
