I dunno how official this is, but the Mensa Intelligence Test has a list of cryptic codes that you have to make out.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.720
For example, 24 H in a D = 24 hours in a day .

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.580
They get harder than that.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.440
I got 10/33 14/33 so far.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.860
I say so far because my brain is sleepy and I’ll probably come back to it later.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.280
Try it out if you want to feel dumb.
