Rework: Book Review

00:00:03.018 --> 00:00:05.575
Published on June 25, 2010.

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:12.089
Rework , a book by 37signals (the guys who made Ruby on Rails), is a pretty simple book.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:19.462
It’s appropriately simple, because the book is almost entirely about simplifying things, and the positive effects of doing so.

00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:25.097
I started reading the book in a protected PDF from the Microsoft library a while back.

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:32.150
Unfortunately the license expired before I read the whole thing, so I grabbed a copy from the Ann Arbor library and finished it up.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.326
The book is incredibly easy to read and also incredibly short.

00:00:36.826 --> 00:00:40.981
It clocks in at a deceptive 273 pages.

00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:46.196
In reality, there is probably more illustration and whitespace than actual text.

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:53.009
It feels like 37signals took general ideas from their blog and distilled them into super short nuggets of information.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.084
I think that the ADD-like feel of the book both helps and hinders.

00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:02.260
It drives home the point that you don’t need a lot of words to explain something.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.998
You can just be simple, and it’ll work.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:12.370
Personally, I feel it’s too easy to blaze through the book and really forget most of what was read since it’s so fast paced.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.827
Good thing I basically read through it twice.

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.864
For the most part, I agree with most of the sentiments in Rework.

00:01:20.364 --> 00:01:24.279
The general message is that you don’t have to act like every other company out there.

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:32.611
You don’t need to be obsessed with getting big, stalking the competition, hiring billions of people, etc, because being small is actually pretty nice.

00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:36.947
You can build something that just works, and from there, improve on it.

00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:43.040
The alternative is taking forever to build a monolithic beast and then finding out you didn’t need all those features.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.954
One interesting thing that I read about in the book was in a section about having “less mass.”

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:51.732
The book explains that:

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:55.369
From here on out, you’ll start accumulating more mass.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.105
And the more massive an object, the more energy required to change its direction.

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:04.041
It’s as true in the business world as it is in the physical world.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:14.951
What’s interesting is that my former manager who had something like 20-30 years of experience in the industry had used this analogy to explain why my former company was moving so damn slow.

00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:22.803
He’s a manager that I truly respected and it’s just kind of funny seeing how common a theme mass and inertia is.

00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:29.956
Within the context of my most recent work experience, Rework actually points out a lot of what was wrong in the culture.

00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:33.173
I could go on about it, but that’s for another post.

00:02:33.673 --> 00:02:42.144
I would encourage you to read the sections: “Meetings Are Toxic,” “Strangers at a Cocktail Party,” “Illusions of Agreement,” and “Send People Home at Five.”

00:02:42.644 --> 00:02:49.596
As for what went right, Rework did touch on some of that, too (“Focus on What Won’t Change,” and “Say No by Default”).

00:02:50.596 --> 00:02:56.510
More recently, I’ve been trying to take the ideas in Rework and apply them to whatever I’m currently doing.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.686
I released an iPhone app just a while ago that was barebones.

00:03:01.186 --> 00:03:05.741
I got a lot of good feedback and learned a bunch about how the App Store process works.

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:09.597
A few days ago I submitted an iPad version of that app.

00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:15.611
It’s also pretty bare, but I know I have room to improve and possibly even start making money with it.

00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:24.603
I think that Rework is especially relevant if you are a “starter” type of person, or would like to have that kind of culture at work but aren’t sure how to go about it.

00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:29.098
I would suggest this book to anyone who works, though.

00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:35.512
If nothing else, it’s a good way to keep an open mind on alternative perspectives regarding business and business culture.
