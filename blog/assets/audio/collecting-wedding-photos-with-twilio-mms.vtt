Collecting Wedding Photos with Twilio MMS

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:06.694
Published on June 18, 2015.

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:11.530
Last Saturday I got married to my longtime pal Emily .

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.025
Emily handled a lot of the wedding planning and she did a really great job.

00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:23.878
I wanted to do some fun things for the wedding and reception and thought it would be fun to make a way for friends to share their photos of our day with us.

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:33.828
I was thinking that it would be easy enough to give people an Instagram hashtag and be done with it, but I wanted to make sure all (or at least most) of our guests would be able to participate.

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:43.199
I figured that Twilio’s MMS would be a pretty straightforward way for our guests to share photos throughout the day without having to remember a hashtag or use a specific app.

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.534
I set up a Twilio phone number to receive and send text messages.

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:53.149
Actually, I just re-used an old one that I still had enabled since I used it for voice only.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:01.081
Because I wanted to write as little boilerplate as possible, I decided on using the Django web framework which I’m already really familiar with.

00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:07.494
The Django admin panel was incredibly useful for debugging and made it dead simple to view photos that were sent.

00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:13.189
I used the django-twilio library which also uses the twilio-python library.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.401
I’ve been on a Heroku app hosting streak lately so I made sure the app could be easily deployable on Heroku for free.

00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:28.993
Since I didn’t have a whole lot of time to build this app (wedding planning takes a lot of attention), I limited my scope to a few goals:

00:01:29.993 --> 00:01:32.550
Be able to broadcast messages to guests throughout the day.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.984
Accept messages that contain MMS images (one or more) and save them to a database.

00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:43.580
Allow guests to “unsubscribe” to messages in case they didn’t want them.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:53.451
I ended up using Ngrok to test the app locally, then threw Runscope in front of it for good measure (yo dawg, I heard you like proxies).

00:01:53.951 --> 00:02:03.381
Runscope was pretty useful in that I didn’t have to keep sending test SMS and MMS messages to my app; I could just replay ones that I had sent previously.

00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:06.358
It probably saved me ~$1 in fees!

00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:12.553
It was pretty straightforward to implement all three of these using the Django library I mentioned earlier.

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:20.724
Because all Twilio text messages hit just one endpoint, I had to design around different use cases which made my code a bit messy.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:24.581
It was fine for an app I’m only going to use once, though.

00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:29.955
The code is gross but it worked and I’m glad I didn’t make it more complicated than it needed to be.

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:38.607
I was originally going to use the broadcasting feature more than I ended up using it (I wanted to do something like cat facts ) which added a bit to the codebase.

00:02:39.607 --> 00:02:44.961
As far as final statistics, I received 70 images from guests during and after the event.

00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:47.379
Some of them are pretty awesome.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:56.749
In case anyone is interested in how the app works/worked, I posted the source code with my hardcoded phone numbers removed and turned into environmental variables.

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:58.528
You can check it out here .

00:02:59.528 --> 00:03:07.519
I am not posting any photos that my guests sent here since they were meant to be private, but here’s a photo I took with my selfie stick of us and the cake!
