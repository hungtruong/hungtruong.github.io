Collecting Wedding Photos with Twilio MMS

00:00:04.617 --> 00:00:07.253
Published on June 18, 2015.

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:12.409
Last Saturday I got married to my longtime pal Emily.

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.665
Emily handled a lot of the wedding planning and she did a really great job.

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:24.916
I wanted to do some fun things for the wedding and reception and thought it would be fun to make a way for friends to share their photos of our day with us.

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:35.187
I was thinking that it would be easy enough to give people an Instagram hashtag and be done with it, but I wanted to make sure all (or at least most) of our guests would be able to participate.

00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:45.197
I figured that Twilio’s MMS would be a pretty straightforward way for our guests to share photos throughout the day without having to remember a hashtag or use a specific app.

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:49.852
I set up a Twilio phone number to receive and send text messages.

00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:55.386
Actually, I just re-used an old one that I still had enabled since I used it for voice only.

00:00:55.886 --> 00:01:03.478
Because I wanted to write as little boilerplate as possible, I decided on using the Django web framework which I’m already really familiar with.

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:09.972
The Django admin panel was incredibly useful for debugging and made it dead simple to view photos that were sent.

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:15.267
I used the django-twilio library which also uses the twilio-python library.

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:22.240
I’ve been on a Heroku app hosting streak lately so I made sure the app could be easily deployable on Heroku for free.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.592
Since I didn’t have a whole lot of time to build this app (wedding planning takes a lot of attention), I limited my scope to a few goals:

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:39.503
I ended up using Ngrok to test the app locally, then threw Runscope in front of it for good measure (yo dawg, I heard you like proxies).

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:48.474
Runscope was pretty useful in that I didn’t have to keep sending test SMS and MMS messages to my app; I could just replay ones that I had sent previously.

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:51.931
It probably saved me ~$1 in fees!

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:57.646
It was pretty straightforward to implement all three of these using the Django library I mentioned earlier.

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:05.818
Because all Twilio text messages hit just one endpoint, I had to design around different use cases which made my code a bit messy.

00:02:06.318 --> 00:02:09.434
It was fine for an app I’m only going to use once, though.

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:14.569
The code is gross but it worked and I’m glad I didn’t make it more complicated than it needed to be.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:24.259
I was originally going to use the broadcasting feature more than I ended up using it (I wanted to do something like cat facts) which added a bit to the codebase.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:30.374
As far as final statistics, I received 70 images from guests during and after the event.

00:02:30.874 --> 00:02:32.712
Some of them are pretty awesome.

00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:41.043
In case anyone is interested in how the app works/worked, I posted the source code with my hardcoded phone numbers removed and turned into environmental variables.

00:02:41.543 --> 00:02:43.141
You can check it out here.

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:51.893
I am not posting any photos that my guests sent here since they were meant to be private, but here’s a photo I took with my selfie stick of us and the cake!

00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:53.532
