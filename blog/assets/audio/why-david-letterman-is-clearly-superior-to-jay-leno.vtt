I’d always known David Letterman was better than Jay Leno, but after he implemented a new feature I like to call the “Kevin Eubanks Laugh Clip,” David Letterman is the only late night talk show host (besides Conan ‘o Brien).

Basically, David tells a joke, then they show a clip of Kevin Eubanks laughing like a dumbass . Pure brilliance.
