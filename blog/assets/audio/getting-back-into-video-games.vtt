Getting Back Into Video Games

00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:06.454

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:10.571
In terms of gaming I feel like I’m pretty inconsistent.

00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:19.542
There are times that I only played the big name games (like Grand Theft Auto and Skyrim) and basically ignored all the other smaller games.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:22.439
My interest in gaming ebbs and flows.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.554
I think that a few recent events have gotten me back into gaming fairly regularly.

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:37.525
About a year ago I subscribed to PS Plus, which provides monthly installments of games for your PS3 and PS Vita/PSP if you have them.

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:44.817
I was introduced to a bunch of cool games that I probably wouldn’t have bought otherwise like Saint’s Row 2, Borderlands.

00:00:45.317 --> 00:00:49.553
As a result, I ended up buying Saint’s Row 3 and Borderlands 2.

00:00:50.553 --> 00:00:54.228
It was also about a year ago that I built a PC for gaming.

00:00:54.728 --> 00:01:00.802
It’s kind of ridiculous how much cheaper it is to play games on a PC than to buy them for consoles.

00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:10.812
Plus, my PC has the added benefit of a better graphics card and more RAM (how the heck can the PS3 only have 256MB of RAM in the first place?).

00:01:11.812 --> 00:01:17.645
During the 2013 Steam Summer sale I went a little crazy and bought more games than I can possibly play.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:24.299
It’s just way too easy to buy them when they cost $5 or less and provide a lot of entertainment, even if they’re kinda old.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.712
I ended up buying Fallout New Vegas (the ultimate edition or whatever) even though I originally bought it for PS3.

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:34.648
Luckily, it’s a lot faster and less buggy now.

00:01:35.648 --> 00:01:39.484
I’ve been playing a lot of video games in my free time for the past few months.

00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:47.896
While I sort of feel guilty that I should be working on web stuff or mobile stuff like side projects, I think it’s sort of necessary to avoid burnout.

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:54.309
Plus I naturally tend to lose interest in games once I find a new piece of technology that I’m interested in learning.
