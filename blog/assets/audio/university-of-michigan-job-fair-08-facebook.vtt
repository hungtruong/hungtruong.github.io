00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
University of Michigan Job Fair ’08 + Facebook!

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.180
Published on September 23, 2008.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.860
Today and Yesterday were fun days since the engineering career fair was going on at north campus.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.880
Having started my own company (I’m the President!), I might not need to be looking at jobs this very moment.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.260
But I’m also looking at PhD programs and other stuff to do after I graduate, so I figured I should scope out the job scene as well.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.660
You’re already familiar with my past job hunting experiences, I wager.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.040
Or if you aren’t check out some posts here in the archives .

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.980
I stuck to the engineering fair this time (there’s also a normal career fair going on at central campus).

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.160
The experience seems to be more of the same for me this year.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.140
The thing I noticed is that there’s a large number of smaller, lesser-known companies who don’t have many people talking to them.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.480
Then there’s the big guys: MSFT, Apple, Intel who get huge ass lines of people waiting to talk.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.700
I kinda feel bad for the smaller guys, but don’t talk to them anyway since they seem pathetic.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.040
I mean that in a sympathetic way.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.780
I’m sure they’re great companies though.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.620
The first day, I went to talk to Microsoft, Apple, Expedia, Amazon and a few others.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.200
A brother of a friend did an internship at Microsoft, and so I have a higher opinion of them than I had before.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.340
They seem pretty into the whole student life thing.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.840
In the evening, they had this experimental tech fiesta thing.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.860
Basically a bunch of newer products with the people working on them, explaining how cool the stuff is.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:49.200
There was stuff like: Zune (the software, very cool), Startup Labs (which I am definitely applying to), Silverlight (which I’m still not convinced will be good) and a random dude playing Halo for what seemed like hours.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.180
Yeah, he basically just sat there the whole time.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.360
The startup labs thing seems to be a incubating thingy based in Cambridge. Way cool.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.360
Apple was pretty standard.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.780
I talked to them, explained I made a company that did iPhone apps, etc.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.160
They seemed to just want me to do an online resume or something.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.460
And this time I didn’t get a free song or any shwag at all!

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.780
Amazon was probably the worst of them all.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.200
Every time I talk to people from Amazon, they just don’t get me. I wanted to talk about cool stuff, but they got wrapped up by testing my “engineerness.”

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.580
Like, they asked me how I would sort a large array of numbers that wouldn’t fit into a single computer.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.480
“Well,” I said, “the answer you’re looking for is probably distributing the work to multiple computers and merging the lists back together after each computer is done with its share.”

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.220
I seriously was just patronizing the person.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.920
Then they threw the “How do you find a loop in a linked list?”

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.940
Actually, first they asked me if I knew what a linked list was.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.680
I wanted to say something like “DUDE, I HAVE A DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE! PLUS NO ONE USES LINKED LISTS IN REAL LIFE!”

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.580
But basically I was happy to finally leave.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.160
Amazon might be a sweet company, but their recruiters blow hard.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.520
I also talked to a dude from Expedia who worked in their labs.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.940
He was really funny and really cool.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.520
I think he enjoys his job a lot.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.860
He was trying hard to see if there was a spot I could fill in the org, but it looks like their labs department is too small right now to hire on a random generalist.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.440
Which is kind of what I love to do.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.940
He was super cool though, seemed kind of crazy in a good way.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.900
I also noticed one of the most exorbitant career fair booths I have ever seen in my life.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.200
It’s the one in the picture at the top of this post.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.620
I should’ve taken more pics.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.600
I don’t know what ArcelorMittal does, but they can afford fucking plasmas in their brushed steel pagodas!

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.020
It was like an experimental Ikea home or something, seriously!

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.540
The second day of the career fair (today) was much quieter.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.080
I talked to Yahoo, imo.im and Arbor Networks.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.300
A classmate of mine did an internship at Yahoo this summer and turned me onto their stuff.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.040
The guy I talked to happened to be working in the mobile dept at Yahoo and dug my iPhone app that I demo’ed for him.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.860
But I said that I wanted to do more project lead stuff like product management.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.200
Unfortunately, it seems like business people do the PMing at Yahoo, which is totally different from most orgs.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.580
I think Microsoft and Google both hire PMs with engineering backgrounds.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.840
Anyway, the dude said to apply anyway and my resume could find its way into the right hands somehow.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.040
imo.im is the company I blogged about previously .

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.380
They sent me a t-shirt!

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.840
The recruiter, Marissa, remembered me and basically reiterated stuff from last time.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.860
I also did a raffle and ended up winning a shirt again.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.640
She’ll mail it to me.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:00.460
Honestly, imo.im seems like a pretty sweet startup gig, but the recruiter explained that they’re looking for extremely talented coders and algorithmers.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.360
I imagine the interview process would be grueling.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.740
It makes sense, though, since they’re a startup and need to have as much manpower for their size as possible.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.420
Arbor Networks is a network security company here in town.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.600
I talked to the guy, thanking them for giving me a shirt the last time I talked to them.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:25.060
I didn’t think there’d be much overlap between my interests and theirs, but we started talking about network visualizations.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.800
I wonder if we were on the same page.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.060
Either way, I’ll check out their company again since their recruiters seem cool.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.780
Finally, Facebook had an info session tonight.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.920
The dude who interviewed me last year was here again.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.780
This time the presentation seemed really too technical and boring versus the one last year which was more fun and about the company itself.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.640
They gave a lot of code examples, but I’ve developed FB apps before so it was old news to me.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.060
I’d be more interested in hearing about FB’s future plans, but I doubt they would reveal stuff like that.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.260
Last year I had interviewed for an engineering gig.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.760
I think I was a bit too rusty for that.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.500
This time, I hope I can prove my worth in more than just coding, but in analysis, business stuff, and creativity too.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.220
Overall, the career fair was pretty fun.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.520
It’s too bad that some recruiters are completely clueless, but the good ones are really good.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:30.500
It seems a bit silly sometimes for recruiters to show up all the way in Ann Arbor just to say “email us your resume,” but I guess the impression is what counts.
