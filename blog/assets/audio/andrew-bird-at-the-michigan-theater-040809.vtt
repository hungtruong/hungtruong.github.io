Andrew Bird at The Michigan Theater, 04/08/09

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.053
Published on April 09, 2009.

00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:15.606
Last night I went to see Andrew Bird along with like 100 of my friends, lots from the School of Information.

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:20.181
Is there something inherently Informational about Andrew Bird’s music?

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:25.656
The opening act was a slightly avant garde group called “ A Hawk and a Hacksaw .”

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:37.185
They had a guy on accordion (who played bass drum and cymbals with his legs), a girl on violin (?) and later a weird string instrument with what looked like a trumpet bell, a trumpeter and a tuba player.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:45.697
I noticed that they kept playing in weird time signatures (7, then 5, then 3, which is not totally weird but less common).

00:00:46.197 --> 00:00:50.672
The songs they played seemed a little too insane, like they were basically showing off.

00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:55.727
The lines were all really fast and it was hard to get a sense of any actual melody.

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:58.384
They were pretty entertaining, nonetheless.

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:01.702
Andrew Bird then came on by himself.

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:06.437
He kept manipulating foot pedals so he could put things he was playing on infinite repeat.

00:01:06.937 --> 00:01:08.135
It was pretty cool.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.193
I wonder how he times it perfectly like that.

00:01:11.693 --> 00:01:17.926
I didn’t really know this before (I listened to his albums a few times previously) but he’s pretty much an expert whistler.

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:20.104
He’s really good at whistling.

00:01:20.604 --> 00:01:24.120
He’s also really good at playing violin and guitar and singing.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.175
Which makes him a quadruple threat (quintuple threat if you count the foot pedal hijinks).

00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:34.091
He played a bunch of songs, many of which garnered lots of applause.

00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:37.307
I liked the “Nervous Tic Motion of the Head” song.

00:01:37.807 --> 00:01:40.604
I also like “Heretics” but he didn’t play that one.

00:01:41.104 --> 00:01:43.901
Those are like the two Andy Bird songs I really like.

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:48.157
“Fiery Crash” is also good, and I think he also didn’t play that one.

00:01:48.657 --> 00:01:53.292
The other songs were all good too, but I just wasn’t as familiar with them as I would have liked.

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:57.408
The mise-en-scene of the stage was pretty interesting.

00:01:57.908 --> 00:02:02.303
He had these giant horns in the back that looked like the old-school phonographs, but bigger.

00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:08.237
There was also a double horn thing that spun randomly, perhaps to indicate the climax of a song.

00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:12.014
I’m not even sure there was sound coming out of them, but they looked cool!

00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:21.804
Overall, Andrew Bird was a great performer (seeing him switch between instruments and hitting pedals on the ground and singing is entertaining by itself).

00:02:22.304 --> 00:02:29.417
His songs are also delightfully pretentious, with interesting lyrics (he rhymes “philharmonics” with “hooked on phonics”).

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:38.228
Oh, and also, he seems to really like pentatonic scales (shoutout to Mr. Blakey, my high school band director for making us learn about scales!).

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:48.238
If this concert were an eBay transaction, I’d have to leave a positive, “GREAT PERFORMER FAST CONCERT AWESOME SINGING A+++++++++ WOULD SEE AGAIN!!!11!11”
