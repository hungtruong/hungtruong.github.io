Writing Google Glass Apps With the GDK Sneak Peek

00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:07.653
Published on February 25, 2014.

00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:13.208
Since the beginning of time, humans have wanted to mount small computers on their heads.

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:20.181
In 2013 we got our wish, as Google started releasing Glass onto explorers and developers alike.

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:28.193
In November of 2013, Google released a “Sneak Peek” of the GDK, a way to write native code for Google Glass.

00:00:29.193 --> 00:00:39.183
While the GDK is still under development and will probably change quite a bit before being finalized, those on the cutting edge will want to familiarize themselves with it.

00:00:40.183 --> 00:00:45.617
In this quick start guide, I’ll go through the steps of writing your first GDK app, “Where Am I?”

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:48.514
This app will ensure you are never lost.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:56.446
By simply shouting “Okay Glass, where am I?” the app will find your latitude and longitude, and try to find the nearest street address.

00:00:57.446 --> 00:00:58.804
Prerequisites

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:04.380
In order to start writing native apps for Google Glass, here’s what you’ll need:

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.058
Getting Started

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:15.990
Google Glass runs on a special version of Android, “Glass Development Kit Sneak Peek” – a tricked out version of API 15.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:25.361
You’ll need to download this version with the Android SDK Manager within ADT (you can open it by clicking on the icon of the Android with a blue box and an arrow on it).

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:31.875
Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to create a new Android project with the correct SDK settings.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:39.167
Use API 15 for Minimum and Target SDK, and set “Compile With” to the GDK Sneak Peek.Congratulations!

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:42.704
You’ve created a project that should run on Google Glass!

00:01:43.204 --> 00:01:49.277
If you try running the app on your device, it may or may not work, since it won’t have a voice trigger associated with it yet.

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:52.734
We’ll add a voice trigger in the next step.

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:55.412
Adding a Voice Trigger

00:01:56.912 --> 00:02:02.106
If you’re following along with git, you can type the following command to fill out all the code for this step:

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:09.739
Because Google Glass is such a new paradigm for user input, we’ll need to set up a voice trigger to allow the user to start our app.

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:17.511
To do this, we’ll add some some strings to our strings.xml and add an xml resource that describes the voice trigger.

00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:23.765
Finally, we’ll add an intent filter to our AndroidManifest.xml to register the voice command.

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:30.998
Now, if you run your code on Glass, you should be able to find the “Where Am I?” command in the Ok, Glass menu!

00:02:31.998 --> 00:02:33.996
Using Glass Cards

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:38.852
We’ve gotten voice commands working, and that’s half the battle.

00:02:39.352 --> 00:02:43.667
Next we’ll learn how to use Cards, the native user interface for Glass.

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:50.880
We’ll need to remove the existing style, then instantiate a Card object, set up its text and set it as the content view.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.597
If you run the app, should see something like this:

00:02:55.597 --> 00:02:57.914
Getting Location and Updating the Card

00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:05.088
If you’re following along with git, you can type the following command to fill out all the code for this step:

00:03:06.088 --> 00:03:10.643
Finally, we want to get the Glass’ location and update the card with the appropriate info.

00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:14.659
Our lost Glass Explorer will be found and all will be well.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:24.749
We’ll do this by requesting location permissions, setting up a LocationManager and handling its callbacks by updating the card with lat long and a geocoded address, if available.

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:32.622
The app should now start getting location updates on the Glass (it can take a while to get a good fix) and update the Card once it finds you.

00:03:33.122 --> 00:03:35.679
The result should look something like this:

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.795
Congratulations! You’ve finished your first Glass app.

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:52.363
Future generations will wonder how they ever knew where they were without a head mounted computer printing out their exact location on the earth into a glowing prism directly above their field of vision at all times!

00:03:53.363 --> 00:03:58.797

Comments

00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:13.125
Thank you! Most tutorials for Glass expect the reader to know a lot of basic android/java stuff already, but I’m a total noob and I’ve been looking for a clear step-by-step guide like this for a while.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:14.903
It was very helpful.

00:04:15.903 --> 00:04:17.981
You’re welcome! I’m glad you found it helpful.
