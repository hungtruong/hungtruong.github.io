New Blog: Take 5

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.140
Published on January 20, 2006.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.220
Ok. So maybe I just like moving my blog more than I like writing in it.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.440
Here’s the deal: I just bought a new domain name called hung-truong.com.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.740
I decided to randomly select a length 4 string, and a length 6 string, and behold, it happened to be my name!

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.800
Anyway, look to http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/ for all your Hung Truong blog needs.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.720
Since the blog is now on my domain, I can pretty much control every aspect of it, rather than have livejournal/ujournal/xanga/myspace control it with their evil ads.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.100
This actually means instead of seeing their evil ads, you can see my evil ads!

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.700
Oh, and the actual layout should be prettier and stuff too.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.020
I’ve imported all of the posts I’ve made ever since I started this thing called “blogging.”

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.400
The earlier you get, the less organized the posts are.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.620
Most of the first ones don’t even have titles.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.320
Still, they’re nice to look back on, to see how far I’ve gone (not far).

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.080
I think this’ll be the last blog move I’ll make, because seriously, I’m tired of all this exporting and importing.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.380
If I wanted to do that for a living, I’d start up a company called “Vandelay Industries”…
