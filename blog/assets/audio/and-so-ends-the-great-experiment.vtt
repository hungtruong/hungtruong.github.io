That’s right, after about two months of doing the quarter scavenging thing, I’ve caved in.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.760
I got $20 worth of quarters from the bank.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.240
For the past three weeks or so, I’ve been short on quarters, which is really inconvenient when I need to do laundry in a hurry.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.860
I had this ideal image in my head of me getting just enough quarters to do laundry per week.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.120
And I coveted quarters.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.100
I searched far and wide for quarters.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.360
I dreamt of quarters.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.920
Keeping them in my special Mario Bros.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.980
? bank , I waited until laundry day, then punched the bottom of the bank until the quartery goodness came out. Or not.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.180
Anyway, I’m really just stalling so I don’t have to do my homework for Networks, but I guess I better.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.080
So let’s publish this post, shall we?
