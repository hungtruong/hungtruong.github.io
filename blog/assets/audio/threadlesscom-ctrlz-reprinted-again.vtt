Threadless.com Ctrl+Z Reprinted Again!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.860
Published on March 06, 2006.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.140
Wow. I didn’t think it would happen, but Ctrl+Z got reprinted again at threadless.com.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.680
Now in black.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.260
I’m seriously thinking of buying this t-shirt again in Large instead of XL.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.760
I lost some weight playing DDR, and now all my t-shirts are too big.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.940
Sad, huh? But also happy, because now I’m less fat!

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.560
Anyway, grab it before it’s gone, because this t-shirt is simply too awesome to pass up.
