The Land Before Time – It Goes To XIII!

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.660
Published on June 28, 2008.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.540
So while I was checking out IMDB and getting lost in cross-references, I came across the Rob Paulsen guy’s filmography.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.640
Rob Paulsen is the guy who does Yakko from Animaniacs and is pretty much in anything that requires voice acting.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.840
Anyway, I saw one of his recent jobs was on The Land Before Time XIII: The Wisdom of Friends.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.700
Read that again.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.780
Yes. There are 13 fucking Land Before Time movies!

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.980
I think all of them besides the first one were direct to video affairs, but still.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.640
Gosh damn! 12 sequels!

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.460
I guess they must still be profitable if they can still churn them out as much as they are.
