Mahalo: Worst Idea Ever (This Month)

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.620
Published on June 01, 2007.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.820
What’s with all these stupid startups that have been coming out recently?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.800
First Truemors, and now Mahalo!

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.280
Mahalo is a “human powered” search engine.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.380
Apparently humans can do a better job of giving search results than an algorithm can.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.360
The idea is that Mahalo pays grunts to make a personalized page for a common search term, like “ iPhone .”

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.680
But let’s look at the results page for iPhone in both Google and Mahalo… First result is Apple’s iPhone page.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.100
On both Google and Mahalo.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.520
Second is… Engadget.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.060
For both. Third in Google is a link to Google News, which is probably more relevant than Mahalo’s third, which is Wikipedia.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.120
But Wikipedia is Google’s #4.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.480
So thanks, Mahalo.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.500
You’ve done a pretty good job of giving me GOOGLE’S SEARCH RESULTS PAGE!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.520
Oh, and if the search term you’re looking for doesn’t exist on Mahalo yet, you get Google’s search results…

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.280
It’s probably just naive to think that humans can do a better job of giving relevant (up to date) search results by hand.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.420
It has to be stupidity to think that this can scale.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.560
There’s a reason that algorithms are invented.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.020
Perhaps Mahalo isn’t trying to compete with Google.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280
But then, what is it trying to do?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.600
Also, I liked this idea better in 1996 when it was called about.com .
