Generation of Chaos Preorders Online!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.340
Published on February 10, 2006.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.500
Generation of Chaos, a strategy RPG for the PSP just went online for preorder today (err… yesterday) at NIS America .

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.320
Being the NIS fanboy that I am, I’m really considering getting this.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.020
The only problem?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.440
I don’t have a PSP…

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.920
Now, the PSP is pretty well known for not having any games that “sell the system.”

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.340
If Generation of Chaos rocks, it could very well be the turning point for me.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.260
I’ll wait for the reviews personally.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.280
Sure, everything that Nippon Ichi does is money in the bank, but this game was actually developed by Idea Factory.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.900
That said, it might not be the SRPG I’m looking for.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.440
If only Nippon Ichi would develop for the Nintendo DS… Now that would be something!
