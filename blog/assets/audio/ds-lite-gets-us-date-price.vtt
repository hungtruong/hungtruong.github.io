DS Lite Gets US Date, Price

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.340
Published on May 04, 2006.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.020
So yeah, the US is getting the DS Lite on June 11th for a whopping $130!

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.080
Oh, wait, that’s how much a normal DS costs now.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.780
Good job to Nintendo for not screwing us on the upgrade.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.900
After upgrading my Gameboy Advance to an SP, there was no way I was gonna buy a Micro while the DS was out!

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.200
It’s nice to see that Nintendo cut the shenanigans.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.580
Unfortunately, it’s only coming in iPod white, so I’ll have to wait, lest they release a lime green one.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:46.340
That’s my rule: if Nintendo releases a lime green X, I will buy the X. Heed those words, Nintendo, heed them wisely.
