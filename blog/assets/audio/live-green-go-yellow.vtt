Live Green, Go Yellow!?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.460
Published on February 06, 2006.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.500
So I found this free t-shirt deal at GM.com.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.160
You’re supposed to go here and click on “get stuff.”

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.140
What do I see when I go there?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.200
The slogan: “Live Green, Go Yellow.”

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.580
And there’s a hot chick + Asian guy wearing the t-shirt!

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.140
Now, maybe I’m reading too much into this, but perhaps GM is trying to promote relations between hot chicks and Asian men.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.240
Notice the giant graphic saying “Go get ‘em” pointing to Asian guy?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.160
If that’s the case, I’m all for it!

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.740
Way to go, GM!

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.440
You’re the savior of Asian men the world over!

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.980
I’ll take one shirt!

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.640
I’m still not buying your cars, though.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.360
EDIT: I think they ran out of shirts.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.460
You could always try eBay .
