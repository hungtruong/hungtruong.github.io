Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis in Ann Arbor 3/10/09

00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:08.452
Published on March 11, 2009.

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:14.327
Last year I was lucky enough to see the LCJO with Wynton Marsalis .

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:18.902
This year I was also just as lucky, and I was able to go with some friends, too!

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:23.259
For the first half of the show, they played stuff from the Thelonious Monk book.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.592
Thelonious Monk is typically kind of hard to listen to, but the arrangements that they played were pretty listenable.

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:33.289
The only one whose name I remember is Criss Cross .

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.245
The second half, they played songs out of the Blue Note label.

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:44.698
When Wynton announced that they were gonna play “Blues Walk,” I expected a pretty uptempo major straightahead bebop blues.

00:00:45.198 --> 00:00:48.714
But apparently there is a difference between Blues Walk and The Blues Walk .

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:52.750
Wynton is pretty good at telling random stories.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.803
Like he talked about Lee Morgan and his funny-named albums: “Delightfulee,” “Cornbread,” “The Rumproller.”

00:01:00.303 --> 00:01:10.213
One of the band members mentioned “The Gigolo” and then Wynton Marsalis made a quip about how that’s why Lee Morgan isn’t here with us today (he was cheating on his girlfriend and she shot him.

00:01:10.713 --> 00:01:13.989
Sometimes, though, I really think that Wynton is making shit up!

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:15.368
Okay, not really.

00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:18.985
He just knows a lot about Jazz and Jazz history.

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:21.003
And classical music.

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:23.181
He’s pretty much a genius.

00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:27.378
The musical aptitude of the whole group was pretty damn good.

00:01:27.878 --> 00:01:32.832
Seeing guys play this well makes me wish I played Piano, Drums, Saxophone, etc.

00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:35.729
And it makes me want to practice my trumpet some more.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.946
Maybe I can work on my chops after graduation…
