Thinkgeek Merch Awesomeness!

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.540
Published on May 26, 2006.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.460
Thinkgeek.com is a crazy store just for nerds.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.080
Pretty much everything there caters to glasses-wearing people who got beat up in high school.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.060
Sometime their merch is kinda lame, but every once in a while, great things pop up there.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.320
While browsing their new stuff, I came across some awesomeness.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.340
So I thought I’d share:

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.100
Yoda Plush Backpack!

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.080
Remember in The Empire Strikes Back, when Luke is training and he carries Yoda on his back?

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.020
I know you do!

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.240
Here’s an official Yoda Plush Backpack!

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.740
! I’m seriously thinking of buying this and finishing out my college career in style.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.840
Or badly beaten… Now all I need to do is get Frank Oz to follow me around and make grunting noises!

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.680
The Solution T-Shirt

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.500
I’m not what you would call a “chemist,” but I still think this shirt is pretty awesome.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.840
First off, it’s green.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.220
Next, it’s got nerd vocabulary on it!

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.480
I’d get this, but I think I’d probably look like a poser since I hate chemistry.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.960
Evil Genius Lab Coat

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.820
There’s just something about labcoats that makes people look smart.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.200
And cool! If it were socially acceptable, I’d probably wear a labcoat everywhere I went.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.660
But then people would probably be all, “hey, are you a scientist or something? Look at my mole!”

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.480
And that’s just not what scientists are for.
