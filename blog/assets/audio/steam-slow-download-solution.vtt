Steam Slow Download Solution

I just bought Civ IV on Steam, because there’s some kind of sale.

00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:16.425
I started downloading it and it was giving me a measly ~200 KB/S download speed.

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:21.720
This kind of sucked because I wanted to play pretty soon, and it would take a few hours at that rate.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.154
I looked in the preferences for downloads, and noticed that I was connected to their Chicago datacenter.

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:32.250
I tried switching it to Detroit and I still got some lame speeds.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.186
Then I switched to Phoenix, Arizona. And voila:

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:42.140
My hypothesis was that the datacenters were dying from the load of the Steam summer sale.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:52.310
So I tried picking a datacenter in a less sparsely populated area (Phoenix probably isn’t serving that much load compared to Chicago or New York), even though it was further away.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.128
I think my hypothesis stands.

00:00:55.628 --> 00:01:00.263
So if you’re experiencing slow downloads, try picking a datacenter that’s further away.

00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:03.320
Just wait until my download is finished first. 🙂
