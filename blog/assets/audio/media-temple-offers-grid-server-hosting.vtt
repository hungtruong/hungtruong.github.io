Media Temple Offers “Grid-Server” Hosting

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.860
Published on October 17, 2006.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.380
So just this morning, a host by the name of “Media Temple” started offering a new type of hosting.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.600
They call it “ Grid-Server ” and it seems to be a system of web servers running in parallel.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.800
It seems like one of those “why didn’t I think of that!” things (well, if you’re nerd, anyway).

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.420
Most hosting services have single machines that will serve 5 or so users at once.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.520
The problem with these is that one user using many resources will slow down the rest of their neighbors’ sites too.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.580
I think this is what I’ve been doing with my sites…

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.300
The whole idea of the grid thing is that each user will be on one large group of computers.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.760
If a user doesn’t use many resources, great.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.340
If the user uses many, the grid can accommodate that. Maybe.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.940
I’m really interested in this service and I might actually switch hosts.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.720
My host has been battling uptime for months now.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.820
I’m kind of getting tired of it.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.760
It really looks bad when Notecentric is down, since it’s supposed to let users access their notes ALL THE TIME.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.080
In fact, I may just order the service right now, and switch when my other hosting runs out.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.140
But what should I put on the mt host? Hmm….
