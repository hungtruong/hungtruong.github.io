Punch Out on Wii Virtual Console!

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.220
Published on April 28, 2007.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.740
I’ve never bought anything using Wii Points before since I don’t really like the idea of micro payments.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.400
I mean, Nintendo should give us free NES games just for having a Wii, right?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.100
Anyway, when I was on the Wii Store channel today, I noticed that Punch Out was on the VC!

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.060
Punch Out is one of those games that I can still enjoy playing, even after like 20 years!

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.400
I can’t believe it’s that old!

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.180
I can’t believe I’m that old!

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.920
Anyway, I used my credit card to buy some Wii Points and downloaded Punch Out!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.140
This is the version with Mr Dream, not Mike Tyson… Speaking of changes, I was on Wikipedia like last week looking at Punch Out stuff (totally unrelated).

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.280
Apparently “ Soda Popinski ” used to be called “Vodka Drunkenski” in the arcade version.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.820
How awesome is that!?

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.380
I got to Bald Bull before I actually lost.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880
That dude is a bitch.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.860
I remembered how to defeat his bull charge, but let’s just say I was a little rusty.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.680
I finally beat him, but then I couldn’t beat Piston Honda in the next league or whatever.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.380
I’ll try again later.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.120
I remember that when I was a kid, that was also the part I gave up.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.860
I guess some things don’t change…

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.140
Also, the new Wiimote isn’t the best controller to play Punch Out on, but it sure as hell beats the original NES controller.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.840
I like to call that old controller “The Blister Machine!”

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.860
Seriously, it hurt.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.420
I hope they release Super Punch Out for the SNES for the virtual console soon.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.920
That game was really awesome, too.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.820
Back in the days where all SNES games were prefixed with the word “Super!”
