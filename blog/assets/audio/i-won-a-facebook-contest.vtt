I Won a Facebook Contest!

00:00:03.018 --> 00:00:06.454
Published on January 22, 2009.

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:12.089
I’ve known about this for a while, but now that it’s Facebook Official , I can make a post on it.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.667
I won a contest held by Facebook!

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:21.880
The contest involved presenting one’s programming environment and explaining how the tools and everything were used.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.654
The contest deadline was the day after Christmas, which was cool because I had some free time to make an entry.

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:30.252
You can see my entry above.

00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:32.670
Click on it to see the big version.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.407
Here’s the text that accompanied it:

00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:43.600
I have a shiny new Macbook Pro running OS X 10.5 for development since it’s got those command line tools I know and love.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.775
(I don’t use spaces normally but it’s a good way to show everything)

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:55.068
Quadrant #1: vim is better than Emacs, let’s just get that out of the way (I hope the Facebook judges agree)!

00:00:55.568 --> 00:01:00.842
I use vim for most of my coding unless I’m working with something slightly complicated.

00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:03.979
For local editing textedit works well.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.954
I might also go with DashCode or TextMate if I feel like getting fancy.

00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:14.888
Quadrant #2: I use XCode because it’s required to do any coding on the iPhone.

00:01:15.388 --> 00:01:17.306
Just between us, XCode blows.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:22.201
It’s pretty retarded in the autocomplete and syntax highlighting departments.

00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:30.293
Quadrant #3: Firefox and the Firebug plugin are the best thing to happen to design/CSS coding since… sliced bread.

00:01:30.793 --> 00:01:31.992
I really love Firebug.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:37.526
Oh, and I use Cyberduck for FTPing if I’m not feeling like using scp.

00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:42.102
Quadrant #4: My wallpaper consists of dinosaurs with lasers.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.958
It’ the awesomest picture I’ve found so far.

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:49.814
When I find an awesomer one, I might think about replacing it.

00:01:50.814 --> 00:01:54.011
As per the explanation of why I won:

00:01:55.011 --> 00:02:03.002
Vim + not-windows + xcode blows + dinosaurs with lasers = win I mean, can you beat dinosaurs and lasers?

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:08.397
Yep, I pretty much won because of the awesome wallpaper I utilize.

00:02:08.897 --> 00:02:10.416
It really is pretty sweet.

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:13.632
You should follow my example and use it as well .

00:02:14.132 --> 00:02:16.130
Maybe it’ll win you a contest someday!

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.409
For my trouble, I get:

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.646
An iPod Touch 16GB

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:24.085
A RipStik Classic

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:28.441
A pair of Sennheiser HD-280 Pro headphones

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.398
A limited puzzle T-shirt (I’ll post a picture when I get it)

00:02:33.398 --> 00:02:36.354
A job at Facebook (editor’s note: I wish!)

00:02:37.354 --> 00:02:41.829
I also get the privilege of having lunch with some Facebook engineers when I’m in the area.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.923
This is probably the neatest prize of all since Facebook is way cool and I’ve never been to their headquarters before.

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:59.212
I’ve been to the Googleplex, the Appleplex (I don’t think it’s really called that) and the Microsoft Campus in Redmond, so this is pretty much the last stop in the list of software places I need to see before I die.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:05.087
Anyway, I’m way grateful to Facebook for liking my entry enough to make it the grand prize winner.

00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:07.504
I had fun making it.

00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:15.277
I’ve gotten a raincheck on having lunch with Facebookers, so maybe during Spring Break or over the Summer I’ll report back on how it went.
