00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.500

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.780
It seems Famitsu (a Japanese video game magazine) ran a poll asking readers to pick the top 100 video games of all time.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.600
Next Generation has the results:

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:44.880
Final Fantasy X (2001) Final Fantasy VII (1997) Dragon Quest III (1988) Dragon Quest VIII (2004) Machi (1998) Final Fantasy IV (1991) Tactics Ogre (1995) Final Fantasy III (1990) Dragon Quest VII (2000) Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998)

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.400
Apparently, Japanese gamers like their RPGs!

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.580
The whole list is pretty much dominated by RPGs with a Mario game here and a Sonic game there.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.360
Strangely, Super Mario RPG didn’t make the list.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.120
Another thing I noticed was that Final Fantasy X-2 sat pretty high at 32nd place.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.540
It beat The Legend of Zelda.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.680
Think about that.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.140
The. Legend. of.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.600
Zelda. I think the Japanese have finally lost it. Seriously.
