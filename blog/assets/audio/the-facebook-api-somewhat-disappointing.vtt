The Facebook API: Somewhat Disappointing

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.100
Published on May 07, 2007.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.580
I had read a few months back or so about Facebook coming up with a developer API.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.680
I hadn’t really felt like trying anything with it until recently when I heard about the FQL (like SQL for Facebook) Query language being created.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.160
Anyway, I tried to think of a few ideas for mini-apps using the API, and today I finally got around to messing with it.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.060
I hit a roadblock pretty quickly, though.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.480
Apparently Facebook’s API will let you find all of the current user’s friends, but it won’t let you see all of the friends of any other user.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.900
This seriously limits the capabilities of the API by a whole lot.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.420
This sort of makes sense.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.800
If the API let you see more than a logged in user could, that user could theoretically get past privacy setting that are in place.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.620
However, the API just blocks all queries that try to find all friends of anyone other than yourself.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.160
When logged in, you can see this info, so I don’t see the harm in offering it in the API.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.080
What this means is that there’s no way to really “traverse graphs” with the API.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.540
You only get info on the user’s immediate friends.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.640
Thus, any application using the API is really only rehashing or using data that is already available on the main site.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.980
That’s fine for simple applications that can sync your address book to Facebook or let you rate how hot your friends are.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.380
But Facebook is a social networking site.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.520
The interesting applications require some kind of access to the graph data of the site.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.460
It’s really disappointing to see that the API limits this so much.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.540
I really would’ve liked to see a bit more capability with the Facebook API.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.680
If Facebook really wants developers to come up with interesting and complex applications, I’d suggest opening it up a bit more.
