I’m in Ur Universities, Graduating Ur Programs

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:08.212
Published on May 10, 2009.

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:16.964
At some point in the last week or two, I graduated from the University of Michigan School of Information with a Master’s of Science in Information.

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:21.380
Yes, that last sentence was totally for SEO purposes.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.414
I figured I should write a blog post about it since I made a big deal about grad school in the past.

00:00:27.914 --> 00:00:30.631
So much so that I even made a blog for it .

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.129
Maybe I should cross-post there.

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.547
Nah, that blog is long-dead.

00:00:36.047 --> 00:00:42.680
In fact, it was totally dead until I just checked it and fixed a php bug that’s probably been there for two months… Oops!

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.593
It’s fun to look back at my old posts and see what I was thinking (or attempting to portray what I was thinking) at the time.

00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:57.205
I went through a bunch of my posts when I was writing this post up, so I guess I can skip a lot and focus on the University experience.

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:03.400
When I went to visiting days , I just coming from an interview with Google that I thought I had aced.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.897
Apparently I was wrong about that.

00:01:06.397 --> 00:01:08.875
I came in with a sort of nonchalant attitude.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:16.966
I think this was kinda good (being too serious is never a good thing) but also kinda bad (I might have not taken the visit as seriously as I should’ve).

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:25.138
At the time I thought there were a pretty large number of non-technical peers for an HCI program, regardless of how interdisciplinary it was supposed to be.

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:29.234
In hindsight I think this concern was reasonable for a CS person.

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:33.330
I guess I don’t think of myself as a CS person anymore, though.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.004
One shock of the program I had to overcome was that people outside of it don’t know what to think of it.

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:44.979
In my numerous job fair experiences , I noticed that recruiters really didn’t know what to do with me.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.155
“You have a computer science background, but you don’t want to write software!?”

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:52.052
Well, sort of but not really.

00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:56.308
I lucked out and talked to a recent graduate who worked for Google.

00:01:56.808 --> 00:02:01.363
He told me that the ideal position I was describing had a name: Product Manager.

00:02:01.863 --> 00:02:08.576
That exchange really helped me solidify my goals for what I wanted to do after I graduated and what I should accomplish before I graduated.

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:13.651
I should also note that I’m pretty lucky that I have a background in CS.

00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:21.983
Many of my classmates and peers in the program do not have a CS background, which makes finding an internship or job even harder for them.

00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:28.636
In a field that’s so new, we have a lot of explaining to do about why the skills we’re learning are valuable to employers.

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:39.525
I’m able to explain it in relative terms (I’m like a software engineer + 1) whereas others have to define who they are from a blank slate, at least in terms the recruiters can understand.

00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:43.882
I had some great opportunities to do academic-style research.

00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:56.689
I did two independent studies: one on an audience-aware public display (using bluetooth, facial detection and a large touch screen display) and another on the reputation system of a large social network, CouchSurfing!

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.666
For the latter I co-authored a paper.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:03.283
We’ll see if it gets into the conference June 1st!

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:11.055
I tried to make sure that I experienced a full range of academia including normal classes, research and being involved with a student org.

00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:15.870
I think I did a good job, though I feel I might have overextended myself a bit.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.825
I sense this post is getting a bit tl;dr, as many of my posts tend to drift towards.

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:24.243
So maybe I’ll just conclude.

00:03:24.743 --> 00:03:30.976
Back when I started thinking about applying to graduate schools, I did so because I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life.

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:36.031
At this point, I think I have a better understanding of what I want to do, generally.

00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:43.403
I should probably try and escape the ivory tower of academia, at least for a while, and see if doing real industry stuff is a good idea.

00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:47.659
Then again, I have been doing my own thing for as long as I’ve been programming.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:57.509
I had thought of applying to PhD programs but that process was cut short when I remembered how much I hate applying to grad school and also after I got a job offer in November.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:04.083
I think that making the leap and attending school for another two years was definitely worth it in terms of professional and personal growth.

00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:10.416
I don’t know if I can say the same for spending ~$70 for a cap, gown and hood that I wore for one ceremony…
