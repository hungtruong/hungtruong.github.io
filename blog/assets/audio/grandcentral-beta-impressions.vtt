GrandCentral Beta: Impressions

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on July 15, 2007.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.020
So I’ve been getting a lot of invites to random beta things recently.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.920
The latest one is GrandCentral, a sort of central hub for your phone number.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.300
It was just recently bought by Google, which is sorta neat. GrandCentral says:

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.860
GrandCentral doesn’t replace your phones; we just link them together and help them do more.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.880
How do we do that?

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.300
We give people One Number…for Life – a number that’s not tied to a phone or a location – but tied to you.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:47.600
With GrandCentral, you can be reached with a single number, answer a call at any phone you want, seamlessly switch phones in the middle of a call, and even know whether a call is important before you take it.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.520
This idea is good in theory.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:01:01.580
My family’s had the same home phone number for like, 20+ years, and if we ever changed that number, a lot of people would instantly lose contact with us, since it’s the only thing point of contact they have.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.480
I signed up and chose a number in the 505 area code (they give you a bunch of choices and you pick one).

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.280
I change cell phone service a lot, which means I usually just change the number as well.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.060
It’s always a hassle to tell everyone when my phone number’s changed.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.120
With GrandCentral, I could just change the number that my primary number forwards to.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.040
So far, the service works.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.820
I have it currently set up to ring on my cell phone, but you can also have it ring to other places as well.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.120
GrandCentral also supports things like spam filtering in case you get a telemarketer call.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.080
I think the service is interesting, but I’m not sure I want to “change” my phone number with a service that’s still in beta.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.660
Who knows how long the company will be around?

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.920
The fact that Google has acquired GrandCentral is a good sign, but I’m still a bit wary of giving people this number since it’d be a hassle to change it again.
