The Omnivore’s Dilemma: Book Report!

00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:07.094
Published on August 04, 2009.

00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:13.528
I just finished reading Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals .

00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:19.861
While it took some time for me to read through all 411 pages, it was a really enjoyable experience.

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:24.037
From my library account page, I can see I renewed the book 5 times!

00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:30.871
The Omnivore’s Dilemma basically states that there is something really wrong with the way that America is eating.

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:38.403
This is probably already very apparent by the amount of obesity, diabetes and eating disorders that we all hear about on the news.

00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:45.296
But besides the insane portion sizes and amounts of sugar, there’s also something horribly strange about the way our food is produced.

00:00:45.796 --> 00:01:02.420
Pollan takes a journalistic approach to get to the bottom of the issue, following the trail of corn to his McDonald’s meal, the life of his CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation) steer, a meal cooked on a “sustainable” farm and his own “perfect meal” that was created solely by himself via foraging and hunting.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.537
As a vegetarian, I’ve always been pretty picky about my food.

00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:14.709
After living on my own and making my own decisions on grocery shopping, I tried to further educate myself on what to eat and what not to eat.

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:24.239
Typically, I follow some general rules (sugar is better than corn syrup, organic is better than non-organic) but I couldn’t say I knew the reasoning behind them.

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:28.415
That’s the way, Pollan argues, that most of America regards food.

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:34.269
He finds it funny that people care more about the person fixing their car than the person producing their food.

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:39.564
While an automobile’s upkeep is pretty important, isn’t our health just as important?

00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:45.199
The book is pretty huge, and there’s really no point in me going through it, writing about the whole thing.

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:48.735
There are a few things that I really appreciated about it.

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:52.192
For one, it confirms my decision not to eat meat.

00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:57.327
CAFOs are pretty horrible in terms of causing suffering for animals.

00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:00.064
They’re also really bad for the environment.

00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:04.879
I also think it’s healthier to abstain from eating hormone-laced animals.

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:10.254
From a great number of viewpoints, it makes sense to not eat mass-produced meat.

00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:13.551
I simply take it a step further and rule out all meat.

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:18.046
Pollan argues that animals evolved with humans to be eaten by them.

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:21.263
After all, many animals in nature are carnivorous.

00:02:21.763 --> 00:02:27.996
While I agree with that, I think that on a personal level, I’d rather not have that blood on my hands if I can help it.

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:35.369
In that regard, I think I’m lucky to be living in a society where it’s possible to choose to not eat meat and still be healthy.

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:45.320
Another interesting idea is that in order to produce the huge amounts of corn needed to make all kinds of food items, farmers need to use synthetic fertilizers.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.096
These fertilizers are created using fossil fuels.

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:52.713
So in order to grow corn, we’re using oil.

00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:57.608
It makes me wonder how efficient the ethanol from corn that fuels cars really is.

00:02:58.108 --> 00:03:05.540
So not only is the corn that we put into our food not necessarily natural and healthy, it’s also depleting our fossil fuels and polluting the environment.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.275
It seems so ironic, but I guess that’s what the government wants to spend money subsidizing.

00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:13.512
I think I’ve already written a lot about this book.

00:03:14.012 --> 00:03:17.608
Really, it’s a good read and everyone who eats should take a look at it.

00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:21.545
But you don’t have to take my word for it! [audio:rr.mp3]
