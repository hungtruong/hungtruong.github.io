LocoRoco for Sony PSP – Sorta Review

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.340
Published on March 12, 2007.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.180
So I bought LocoRoco from Amazon.com after some crazy glitch that let me order it for 60% off.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.920
It finally came while I was out of town and I got a chance to sit down and play it.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.920
LocoRoco is one of those weird Japanese games that become famous due to their weirdness.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.380
In LocoRoco, you roll a yellow ball animal thing by tilting the world left or right.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.840
You can also bump the world so the ball can jump.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.820
When the ball eats red flowers, it can grow.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.960
You can also blow up the big ball into smaller balls, and reform the big ball later on.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.080
Basically, the idea is to get the ball as large as possible and to make it to the end of the stage.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.500
You can get attacked by black spiky things that will reduce your size.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.680
At the end of the stage, you see how well you did getting larger, and collecting other random stuff.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.600
And that’s how the whole game goes.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.700
There’s not much else.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.560
If you’ve played one stage, you’ve sorta played them all.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.420
I got through the first world.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.140
One plus is that the game is super cute.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.520
Like the little yellow balls will sing in random pseudo-Japanese (it’s not actual Japanese, but it uses Japanese syllables).

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.580
And the theme song is sorta addicting.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.120
Just listen to it!

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.580
[audio:LocoRoco Title Theme.mp3]

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.300
So yeah, LocoRoco is sorta repetitive, but also way cute. Like me!
