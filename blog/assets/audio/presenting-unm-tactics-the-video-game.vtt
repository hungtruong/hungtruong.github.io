00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
Presenting UNM Tactics: The Video Game!

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.500
Published on January 08, 2007.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.860
Back in the Spring of 2005, I took an intro to video game design and programming class.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.200
While I had a pretty good background in programming, I hadn’t done the kind of stuff for video games before.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.340
The first assignment in the class was to come up with some kind of game concept that would end up being a project for the class.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.860
I really love RPGs, and the more offbeat they are, the better.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.560
One of my favorites is Earthbound for the SNES.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.780
I also dig the SRPGs from Nippon Ichi like Disgaea.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.520
Originally I wanted to do a Strategy RPG in the setting of campus life.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.340
It was called “UNM Tactics!”

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.080
The whole SRPG thing didn’t turn out so well, and in the end, we made a generic style university RPG instead.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.120
We kept the name as UNM Tactics, even though it wasn’t really a tactics type game.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.580
We used RPG Maker XP, which is a really easy to use frontend system for, well, making RPGs.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.880
After pulling a few all nighters, we finished the final presentation, and as a pleasant surprise, I got an A+!

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.340
After the class, I sorta forgot about the game, but I was reminded of it after watching that movie, College Saga.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.380
From the readme:

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.860
UNM Tactics is an RPG set at the University of New Mexico.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.360
It was created by a team of programmers and artists for CS 491: Intro to Video Game Development.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.700
While a working demo was created, the game was never fully completed.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.120
This game is the demo that was used for the final class presentation.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.320
You can download the game here if you don’t want the story to be spoiled.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.340
The game comes in a self extracting executable.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.120
You just need to run it and point it to an output directory.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.220
Then run the “Game.exe” file and you’re good to go!

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.200
The game should run on any Windows system, though I’ve only tested it on Windows XP.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.780
Use the contact form if you need some support.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.420
Now it’s time for screencaps and commentary!

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.820
This is the SUB, or Student Union Building.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.560
I made all of the tiles by hand.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.900
Well, in Photoshop… This screen is right before you fight the Emo.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.720
You need to fight the Emo to get a Chicken Burger for the ITEL system so you can pass the semester.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.140
Yeah, school is complicated…

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.980
This is the overhead map.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.000
We just copied and pasted from Google Maps for the UNM area.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.580
Everything’s where it’s supposed to be, though!

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.200
You need to press space on the bullseyes to get enter that area.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.940
To the North is the duck pond .

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.960
To the South is South Lot (duh) and the bookstore.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.880
This is the battle screen.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.300
The Nerd is using his special power, Segmentation Fault .

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.600
This attack has the elemental power of “math,” which thugs are weak against.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.500
You’ll also notice that the Emo has joined the party.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.240
His special move is “cut self.”

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.480
This screen is from one of the missions.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.340
You need to fight the King Duck who has taken over the duck pond.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.240
He’s based on a real life goose who runs amok at the UNM Duck Pond.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.660
If you ever see him, watch out!

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.820
Originally I wanted to make South Lot like the lost woods in The Legend of Zelda.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.000
This proved to be too much work, so I just made it a couple of screens.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.620
Yes, there are only like, 3 kinds of cars at the lot.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.560
And yes, those are DDR arrows pointing you to the next screen…

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.240
Here’s the battle with the malfunctioning South Lot Bus.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.460
If you look closely, you can tell that it is in fact the G and Q Lot bus.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.680
Also, the background of the battle is the Q Lot.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.060
You’ll also notice that there’s a bus driver in there.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.320
He’s actually a pretty cool guy.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.100
The radio stations that Wesley picks are always the best.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.220
After you complete all of the missions in the demo, you get to fight the final boss.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.360
I won’t spoil it; you’ll have to beat the game yourself.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.220
Also, check it out, the Emo is back at Chick-fil-A, even though he’s in our party!

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.640
So much for bug testing…

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.880
While I did a whole lot of this game, I didn’t do all of it.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.500
Here’s some credits!

Funny story: All of the characters are supposed to correspond to one person who was in the game.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.440
The nerd is supposed to look like me, Anthony is the playboy, Robert is the jock.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.260
The emo character is some guy in our group who really did go emo and dropped the class. Go figure.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.380
Overall, UNM Tactics was a lot of hard work, but I’m fairly proud of the finished product.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.160
Feel free to download it, play it, and share it.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.900
Just don’t charge money or pay for it.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.080
Like anyone would pay for this…
