00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.877
On Customer Service and Giant Companies

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:06.534
Published on April 14, 2009.

00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:10.891
For a long time, I’ve been a pretty cost-centered consumer.

00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:14.587
By that, I mean that I mostly cared about how much things cost.

00:00:15.087 --> 00:00:18.843
This makes sense if you’re poor or really care about getting a good deal.

00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:26.535
Recently at SXSW, I considered the concept of customer service as explained by Tony Hsieh , the Zappos guy.

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:31.430
Random thought: crap, I still need to finish my epic SXSW post!

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.461
Tony argued that by focusing on customer service and, a step above that, customer happiness, you could grow your business based on word of mouth and repeat business.

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:43.958
This makes sense for a retailer.

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:49.972
It’s pretty wonderful how successful Zappos has become just by treating the customer like a king.

00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:54.867
Lately I’ve been working on projects that rely on software written by other companies.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:57.205
This concept is not new.

00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:01.301
I’ve been very frustrated by interacting with systems that don’t work well.

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:08.914
Thinking back to the Zappos talk, I wonder if the customer service (and happiness) concept couldn’t be translated to giant software companies.

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:15.667
Web apps are cool because they are relatively easy to build and the users are the most important part of them.

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:19.524
They create much of the data and interactions between each other.

00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:23.380
Web apps have the potential to be highly scalable.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.074
What often ends up happening is that a small number of engineers work on an app that millions of people use.

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:32.611
This is the case at places like Facebook and Google.

00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:41.182
Facebook’s job site currently states that it has less than 200 engineers and just a few days ago announced it had reached 200 million users.

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:45.118
That’s a ratio of about 1 million users per engineer.

00:01:45.618 --> 00:01:49.054
I’m sure Google has similar insane ratios.

00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:52.612
What do these ratios mean for “customer service?”

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.189
Basically that it doesn’t exist.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.845
And this leads to great frustration when I have an issue with the software.

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:05.619
For example, I needed to rename a Facebook Page for work because there was a typo in the name.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.516
I filled out the contact form.

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:10.454
Never got a reply.

00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:15.350
I did check the FAQ and yes, it stated that page names are not changeable.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.048
But why the hell not?

00:02:17.548 --> 00:02:19.786
It’s just a record in a database.

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:26.039
The problem isn’t really that the name isn’t changeable; it’s that I get the feeling that no one is listening to me.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:32.314
I also had an issue with Google Apps and their gadget within Sites not working in IE.

00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:40.565
This is a pretty obscure error but upon inspection of the Google forums (which are actually kind of useful), it appears others have the same issue.

00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:50.176
But even though multiple users have complained, the Google spokespeople are happy to claim it’s an edge case and dismiss it by giving out urls to help articles that don’t resolve the issue.

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:52.594
Again, it seems like they don’t care.

00:02:53.594 --> 00:02:58.548
I also had a problem with Google Forms being extremely volatile and absolutely not working correctly.

00:02:59.048 --> 00:03:04.242
I was literally wondering if anyone had run any kind of QA on the software before releasing it.

00:03:04.742 --> 00:03:08.019
Simply put, the software was not ready for deployment.

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.756
Who could I voice my opinion to?

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:15.891
No one, because Google is a faceless giant who doesn’t care what I think.

00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:21.446
And they shouldn’t care, because this user frustration is not hurting their bottom lines.

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:25.782
For every frustrated user there are a thousand who aren’t frustrated.

00:03:26.282 --> 00:03:31.796
Those users will probably just go away and avoid putting more strain on Google’s massive infrastructure.

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:33.894
Good riddance, right?

00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:39.529
I can’t imagine there is a good solution to the problem of too many users and not enough support.

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:46.262
Forums help, but they can’t completely solve everyone’s problems, especially when the problems exist in bugs in the software.

00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:52.276
I wish companies would pay more attention to their “customers” when they had real issues with their products.

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:56.372
But these companies are just way too massive to give personalized help.

00:03:57.372 --> 00:04:01.927
I imagine that some day there will be a massive backlash against this style of software design.

00:04:02.427 --> 00:04:07.941
Internet scale companies have a way of alienating users and making them feel as though their opinions really don’t matter.

00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:13.555
They take a “we know best” approach and make blanket decisions that will be good for 99% of the user base.

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:21.008
When users protest a redesign of Facebook in aggregate, they might wield more power, but how influential are they, really?

00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:26.563
I guess open-source software might be able to fill niches where these giant companies fail.

00:04:27.063 --> 00:04:35.214
Case in point: WordPress, which I’m using to write this blog post (but who knows where my blog will reside in the future?) is thousands of times better than Google’s Blogger.

00:04:35.714 --> 00:04:44.185
My theory is that after Google bought Blogger, they moved it to their servers and promptly stopped caring about features, usability and general quality.

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:47.402
In my opinion, Blogger is an anachronism.

00:04:47.902 --> 00:04:49.660
It sucks hard.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.834
WordPress, on the other hand, has been constantly improving thanks to contributions from volunteers.

00:04:56.334 --> 00:05:00.889
This is also probably the reason that WordPress kicked MovableType’s ass.

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.444
So open-source software is quicker to improve and react to user needs.

00:05:06.944 --> 00:05:11.179
But how do you open-source social software that relies on network-effects like Facebook?

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:13.916
I guess a decentralized model would work.

00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:17.932
Maybe a social network based on a protocol instead of a website.

00:05:18.432 --> 00:05:20.670
Does that sound a bit like twitter?

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.487
Maybe, but probably not enough.

00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:32.698
For now, we’re still stuck accepting that we’re lowly users, unable to affect the status quo of applications owned by giant companies who don’t care what we think.

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:37.194
Unless, of course, we are employed by those companies and really want to make a difference…
