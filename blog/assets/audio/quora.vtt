Quora

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.696
Published on September 13, 2010.

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:14.967
I finally heard about Quora enough times (I suppose I reached my contagion threshold) to make a profile for it a week or so ago, and I ended up exploring it in depth today.

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:20.841
Quora is basically a site that lets you ask questions and answer other people’s questions.

00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:26.695
Facebook also just recently released a feature called Questions that seems sort of similar.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:37.025
While Quora hasn’t put limits on what kinds of questions you can ask, the bulk seem to be about technology and startups, probably because of the types of early adopters who are using the site.

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:42.260
Quora is interesting to me because it’s basically enabling people to share knowledge.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.315
In a way, it’s like Wikipedia, but with a seemingly smaller barrier to entry.

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:55.567
While Wikipedia has some harsh rules on how to edit an article, Quora is centered around questions and answers on various topics.

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:59.583
You can literally sign up and answer questions within a few minutes.

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:08.894
As with any great piece of social software, Quora seems to work because it makes the right things visible, which gives incentives for people to keep contributing.

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:14.988
Personally, I see it as a way to build up my online reputation as an expert on a number of subjects.

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:19.644
It’s interesting because the incentives to use the site are baked into the site itself.

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:26.377
It’s easy to see who has answered many questions, who has a lot of followers, who has been “endorsed” by others, etc.

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:30.073
With this system, pretty much everyone wins.

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:41.602
The question askers have their questions answered, the answerers get the glory of answering a question well, and even users who do neither can still benefit from reading good answers to good questions.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:49.634
Another neat aspect of the site is that there are many users who could be considered “internet celebrities” or important in some other right.

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:55.968
There are many founders of companies and other execs who go to the trouble of answering questions about the companies they founded.

00:01:56.468 --> 00:02:01.502
This is cool because users are all sort of on the same level (or at least have the potential to be).

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:09.514
Think of the opportunities if you were one of the first 1000 people on Twitter and could have great conversations with the other early adopters.

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:15.069
From playing around with it a bit today, I’m very impressed and excited about Quora.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.161
By comparison, I just goofed off on Facebook Questions and unlocked the Rickroll Easter Egg (ask “How is babby formed?”).

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:33.491
Quora still has a few things it could do better (like make it easier to find really great answers to really great questions, perhaps older ones) but even now it seems like a great tool.

00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:41.183
With the right attention to detail and community, I feel like it could be the next Wikipedia in terms of social computing success stories.

00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:48.816
Oh, and here’s an example of a really good answer to a question: Why is Facebook creating a Q&A product to compete against Quora?
