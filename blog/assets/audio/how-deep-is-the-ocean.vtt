How Deep is the Ocean?

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.660
Published on December 01, 2005.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.100
How much do I love you?

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.900
Intangible.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.940
I’ll tell you no lie.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.780
How deep is the ocean?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:24.980
Average depth (in meters): Pacific: 4,188 Atlantic: 3,872 Indian: 3,872

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.660
How high is the sky?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.940
The upper limit of the Earth’s exosphere (the uppermost layer of the Earth’s atmosphere) is approximately 10,000 km high.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.860
How many times a day do I think of you?

00:00:39.860 --> 00:01:01.860
Rate of thought during waking hours (10 per second) = 36000 thoughts per hour Rate of thought during sleeping hours = 3600 thoughts per hour Number of thoughts per day = 604800 thoughts per day\

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.100
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.900
Depends on the current season, humidity levels, dewpoints, time of day, etc.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.540
How far would I travel to be where you are?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:27.700
Assuming both of us are on the Earth, the farthest you could travel (taking the shortest path) is half of the Earth’s circumference: 20037.58 km (assuming you are traveling along the surface of the earth)

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.660
How far is the journey from here to a star?

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.900
The closest star to the Earth is the Sun, which is on approximately 1AU from Earth.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.720
The next closest star is Proxima Centauri, which is approximately 250,000AU away.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.600
And if I ever lost you how much would I cry?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.880
Water makes up about 60f the human body.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.020
If one were to cry all of the water in his body out in tears, simply take (bodymass*.6)/mass of a single tear.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.620
How deep is the ocean?

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.980
See above.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.420
How high is the sky?

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.460
See above.
