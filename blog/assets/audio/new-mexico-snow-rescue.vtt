It’s been snowing a hella lot these past few days in New Mexico.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.720
On the worst day, we got like, more than 10 inches of snow!

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.260
My brother was at work and couldn’t get his Miata out of the snow, so we had to go rescue him.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.020
I recently got a Macbook as a graduation gift, so I decided to take some video and make a movie.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.320
I present to you, NM Snow Rescue!
