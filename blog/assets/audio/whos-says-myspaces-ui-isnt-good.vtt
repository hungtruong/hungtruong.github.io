Whos Says Myspace’s UI Isn’t Good?

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.020
Published on April 27, 2007.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.460
I have a Myspace account, mainly to keep in touch with people who don’t have Facebook accounts.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.680
It’s sort of like making a deal with the devil, but hey, people use it.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.800
Anyway, I was reading some stupid “bulletin” that one of my “friends” posted.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.460
It was just some lame spam.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
Then I noticed that Myspace actually does keep the user in mind in some cases.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.420
See the above screencap?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.880
Whoa, there’s a “Delete From Friends” button!

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.820
Genius. It saved me like 10 clicks to do it the hard way.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.760
Sorry Slevin, it’s time we went our separate ways.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
Maybe this means that Myspace really isn’t all about the $$$.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.300
Okay, probably not.
