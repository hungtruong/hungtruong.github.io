I Finally Got A Nintendo Wii! Wii First Impressions.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.060
Published on January 22, 2007.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.460
That’s right! Two months after the Wii was released in America, I finally got it!

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.560
Yesterday was some kind of national Wii holiday.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.220
Apparently 1/21/06 was the day for all retailers to hold the Wii.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.040
This is probably why I couldn’t find one in stock for the past two weeks since my last attempt.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.240
I decided to head over to Circuit City around 9am.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.420
That’s an hour before they open.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.960
I was surprised to see two guys standing there.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.420
They told me that the Circuit City guys only had 2 Wiis to sell to the general public, and that the others would go to their pre-order customers.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.760
False Advertsising!!! I’m probably going to file a compaint.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.040
Next I got to Best Buy around 9:30.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.180
I was under the impression that the store would open at 11am, since that’s what the online store checker thing said.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.080
The opening time was actually 10am.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.860
So I got there only 30 minutes early.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.200
I saw a pretty long line and counted around 38 people in front of me.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.380
Still, I figured they might have a ton; they’re Best Buy.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.140
So once 10am rolls along, they start herding us in there like cattle.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.560
One person remarked that it was a good sign that they didn’t hand out tickets.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.380
There must be enough for everyone in line.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.400
We snaked around the store until we got to the video game section.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.180
There we waited for each person to pick up a Wii and move along.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.800
It was kind of like the Soup Nazi thing from Seinfeld.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.740
When I finally get to the Wiis, there are about 3 left after mine.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.520
My linemates and I all share some high tens.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.520
In my daze of my accomplishment, I decided to also pick up Legend of Zelda: Twighlight Princess at full price.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.660
This is even though I know I can get it cheaper.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.200
I’m a tool like that.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.700
I didn’t even use a gamer’s gift card…

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.660
As far as the Wii goes, it’s pretty darn cool.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.800
The remote control is neat because it can give you some vibration feedback when you’re going over buttons.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.100
The IR sensor is still kind of inaccurate, but maybe I need to do some more calibration.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.980
Wii Sports is insanely fun.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.280
I could probably play the bowling game for hours at a time.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.220
That is, if my arm wasn’t so sore right now.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.920
My mom even played it, and did really well in bowling.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.260
My dad couldn’t quite get the hang of releasing the button before throwing the ball.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.420
Zelda is pretty cool, but the graphics seem kind of lacking.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.280
I’m gonna go get a component cable and see if that doesn’t help things.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.100
I think the Wii graphics are only slightly better than the Gamecube, which was actually the strongest console of the last generation…

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.060
Another cool thing is that the Wii has full backwards compatibility for the Gamecube.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.880
You just flip open the top and find some memory card slots and controller ports.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.220
I really wish there was an option to save to internal memory, though.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.880
It kind of blows that I need to keep using the very small Gamecube memory card.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.440
All in all, I think the Wii is very cool.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.340
Hopefully the good games will keep rolling in.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.040
I might have to pick up Trauma Center or Wario Ware .

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.020
Wii Play is coming out soon, too.
