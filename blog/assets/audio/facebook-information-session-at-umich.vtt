Facebook Information Session at Umich

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.460
Published on October 04, 2007.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.500
So tonight there was a Facebook info session up at North Campus in the exact same room as the Yahoo one was, exactly one week ago to this very day!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.980
In stark contrast to the Yahoo one, there were actually engineers, and they actually told us what they did, and why they liked it.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
Bob Trahannypoo (was that really his name?) and Jon Warman did the talking.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:39.880
The info session was very geared towards engineers, and I found it interesting that a lot of the stuff they talked about seemed like shared knowledge among the room.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.300
Like they’d reference f8 and just assumed we knew what that was.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.000
I got all the references, but I’m not sure about other people.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.840
Before the session, I was pretty convinced that Facebook was a solid company and seemed fun to work for.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.820
Now, I’m even more convinced.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.080
When your engineers answer questions like PR people, you know you’ve built a pretty good company culture.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.800
Also, for anyone who hates the “is” in the status updates, I asked them if they could remove it when they asked for questions.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.260
The answer I got was “no, but maybe when we internationalize the ‘is’ will go away.”

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.360
So good news on that front.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.120
As far as schwag goes (it’s always a factor), I got some neat Facebook branded gum and M&Ms.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.220
If I ever decide not to be lazy, maybe I’ll take pictures.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.400
On the downside, no pens, notebooks, post-its, or shirts!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.700
Come on, guys!

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.360
All the Silicon Valley companies are doing it!

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.240
The only thing that really sorta annoyed me was that I had tried and tried to get an interview with them.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.460
Because I’m not in the Engineering school of Michigan, I couldn’t log into their super special system.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.800
I still tried contacting the Facebook HR people but they never replied.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.980
I physically handed them my resume, so hopefully they’ll have a slot open tomorrow.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:08.560
I felt a bit of Engineering snobbery going on (as in, you’re nothing if you’re not an engineer), which is funny since I still consider myself an engineer (B.S. in Comp Sci == Engineer, right?).

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.500
But I guess that’s the price I pay for entering the School of Information…

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.300
I’m still convinced that SI is a good choice, and also that Facebook rocks.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.640
Let’s see if something good happens.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.360
EDIT: I got an interview, so it looks like I’ll be reading a bit of the algorithms book tonight.
