Wirefly Mobile Store Review

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.700
Published on January 03, 2007.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.020
First off, I should note that this is a payed review via reviewme.com.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.180
Wirefly is an online store that sells cell phones and service.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.120
I think they sell service for just about every carrier, including T-Mobile, Sprint, and Alltel.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.540
Taking a quick look at Amazon.com’s mobile phone store, it looks like Alltel is not included.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.400
So I guess in that respect, Wirefly wins.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.440
I’m actually thinking about getting a new phone, so I just “pretended” to buy a new phone at both stores.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.500
The Motorola Razr V3t immediately comes to mind as something I’d like to buy.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.320
At Wirefly, the phone is $49.99 with a $50 rebate.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.140
At Amazon.com, the phone is $24.99 with a $50 rebate and a $25 rebate.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:11:51.920
The prices after rebate are $.01 and -$50.01 for Wirefly and Amazon.com, respectively.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.300
These are both the price paid when bought with a plan.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:01.020
I think Amazon.com is pretty much the standard when it comes to buying phone service online.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.640
They have a pretty good reputation and very good prices.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.460
I can’t say anything about Wirefly’s service, but it seems okay from the website.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:15.960
I guess the only thing I could say is that if you’re looking for Alltel service, you won’t find it at Amazon.com.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.700
Wirefly looks like a decent retailer; it just isn’t as good as Amazon.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:27.220
I’d still go with Amazon in the end due to the prices and trust I have in that online retailer.
