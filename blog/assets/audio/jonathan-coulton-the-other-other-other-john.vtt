Jonathan Coulton: The Other, Other, Other John

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.900
Published on April 22, 2007.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:19.300
For some reason or other, today I was inspired to check out The Areas of My Expertise again, and I remembered that besides John Hodgman, there’s another John on that CD: Jonathan Coulton.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.960
He’s the musical guy behind the theme song for the audiobook, which I wish was available in a higher quality recording.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.880
Previously, I had heard him do a cover of Baby Got Back in acoustic guitar, but I didn’t realize it was him.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.580
Only when I went to his website, which has a bunch of MP3s, did I make the connection.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:51.560
He also has a bunch of other really neat songs, like Skymall , which is about those catalogs you find in the airplane seats that feature gigantic crossword puzzles , and Ikea , which is about the bitchin’ furniture store that my entire family loves.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.140
I read somewhere that Sweden trusts Ikea more than their own government.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.040
Which means that either Ikea is awesome, or the Swedish government is horrible.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:10.120
The coolest song I found so far (I haven’t listened to all of the MP3s yet) is a mashup of “25 or 6 to 4”, and “When I’m 64.”

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.460
The vocals of the latter spliced with the background of the former makes for a really cool, melancholy sound.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.480
I like it a lot.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.780
Check it out:

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.940
And also check out his other songs too!
