An Uninvited Dream

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.980
Published on October 25, 2007.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.580
So, about two nights ago I had a pair of unsettling dreams.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.520
They weren’t nightmares, but I guess they were scary enough to make me wake up.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.140
Well, one of them.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.260
First, some background.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.200
There’s this old NES game called Uninvited that was ported from a mac game (I totally didn’t know this until I just looked it up).

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.140
It’s a pretty simple point and click game where you’ve happened upon a strange mansion and spooky things pop up everywhere.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.200
It’s actually kind of scary, especially the part where the ghost that looks like Scarlet o’ Hara rips you to shreds if you talk to her.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.320
My dream was that I was sort of in this world.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.700
I dunno if I was playing the game, or actually in it.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.080
The point and click interface was there, regardless.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.140
I was walking around the house, and I knew that there was some kind of monster on top of the stairs.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.400
The plan would be that I’d go up the stairs, see the monster, run down and then spray it with some sleep spray or something.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.460
But the first time I just used the spray without going up the stairs and I think it killed me.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.220
So the second time (I guess I was playing the game), I went up the stairs and I don’t really remember what happened next.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.040
I remember the whole experience of playing Uninvited to be quite freaky, so this translated into the dream as well.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.300
At the time the game did have a pretty strong effect on my mental state.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.520
While it wasn’t a full blown nightmare, it did wake me up and I had to assure myself I wasn’t being eaten by a ghost or something.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.720
Oh, and the other dream I had the same night was that the old Lobos runningback, Dontrell Moore, had some kind of genetic disease and was going to die.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.060
I have no idea why I dreamed about that…
