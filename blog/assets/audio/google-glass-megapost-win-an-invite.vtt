Google Glass Megapost (+ win an invite!)

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:08.053
Published on December 06, 2013.

00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:12.489
Here’s a giant post of stuff I’ve been doing with Google Glass!

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:18.902
I made a survey, wrote an app and am running a contest, so that’s all bundled into this blog post.

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:20.382
Survey

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:25.718
I got a Google Glass invite after signing up at Google’s official waitlist .

00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:31.492
After deciding I would go ahead and get one, I was paralyzed by the choice of which color to order.

00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:36.706
I made a survey that asked participants to rank the five colors in order of awesomeness.

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:44.079
The results surprised me. I was leaning towards white (cotton) and sky blue, but everyone seemed to really like tangerine (orange).

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.751
I was going to go against the popular vote and get the white one, but both the white and black ones were out of stock at the time, so I went for the fan favorite.

00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:59.324
I ended up getting the Tangerine device the day after I ordered it (next day shipping FTW).

00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:01.683
GlassFart

00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:11.734
My intention with getting the Google Glass is to try it out and see if I can make anything really cool with the additional sensors and the fact that the device is worn on a person’s head.

00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:16.629
I was really struggling with what to start working on, and then it hit me: a fart app.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:22.643
I was actually working on a Dragonball Z Scouter app, but that was going to be too complicated.

00:01:23.143 --> 00:01:29.136
I found that you can insert your own “Okay Glass” prompts to start an app, so I figured I’d make a hello world fart app.

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:36.210
The history of fart apps on advanced mobile operating systems is a long one, so I won’t go over all that.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.543
Suffice it to say I am proud to have written the first (as far as I know) native fart app for Google Glass.

00:01:43.043 --> 00:01:45.520
Here’s a video of me demonstrating it:

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.754
Having played around with the GDK a bit, and the device a bit more, I am still not sure if I will keep it.

00:01:53.254 --> 00:01:56.130
The $1500 price tag is one factor.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.587
The public acceptance of the device is another.

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:03.283
My opinions on my previous Glass post still hold.

00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:10.496
If anything, the opportunity is definitely worth the $1500 “loan” to Google plus return shipping.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:12.455
Contest

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:19.789
Before I even got my first Google Glass invite, I went to a GDG Android meeting in Ann Arbor.

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:24.124
The organizer had some spare Glass invites, so I asked for one.

00:02:24.624 --> 00:02:32.216
I hadn’t heard back about the invite, but after ordering my Glass from my original invites, I got another one from the GDG group’s pool.

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:40.308
I figured I’d give it away, and to drum up interest in the fart app, I’m going to make a tweet and ask users to retweet it for a chance to win.

00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:46.582
To celebrate my Google Glass fart app, I'm running a contest to win a Glass invite!

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:54.674
RT to enter, check http://t.co/vfT2UtsuSc for details.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.288
Here’s some rules:

00:03:02.288 --> 00:03:04.766
Enter the contest by retweeting this tweet .

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:08.243
You can only enter once per Twitter account.

00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:13.478
Don’t make multiple Twitter accounts to enter or you’ll be disqualified.

00:03:14.478 --> 00:03:16.316
The contest is for the invite code.

00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:19.213
You still have to buy the Glass yourself.

00:03:20.213 --> 00:03:24.848
The contest will end on Sunday, Dec 8th at 11:59PM ET.

00:03:25.848 --> 00:03:32.721
The contest winner will be chosen by random and will get a DM with the code (you should also follow me to make sure I can DM you).

00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:37.876
The invite code expires some time on Dec 10th, so you’ll have a couple of days to order it.

00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:40.794
I’m not liable for anything.

00:03:41.294 --> 00:03:45.050
Like if you’re mad about getting an invite and want to sue me or something.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.365
If no one enters I’ll probably just tweet out the code and the first person to use it gets it!

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:53.523
Here are Google’s rule for eligibility:

00:03:54.523 --> 00:03:55.961
