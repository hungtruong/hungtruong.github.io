Google Glass Megapost (+ win an invite!)

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:07.973
Published on December 06, 2013.

00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:12.729
Here’s a giant post of stuff I’ve been doing with Google Glass!

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:19.222
I made a survey, wrote an app and am running a contest, so that’s all bundled into this blog post.

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:21.101
Survey

00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:26.756
I got a Google Glass invite after signing up at Google’s official waitlist.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:32.770
After deciding I would go ahead and get one, I was paralyzed by the choice of which color to order.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.465
I made a survey that asked participants to rank the five colors in order of awesomeness.

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:46.477
The results surprised me. I was leaning towards white (cotton) and sky blue, but everyone seemed to really like tangerine (orange).

00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:55.228
I was going to go against the popular vote and get the white one, but both the white and black ones were out of stock at the time, so I went for the fan favorite.

00:00:55.728 --> 00:01:01.002
I ended up getting the Tangerine device the day after I ordered it (next day shipping FTW).

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:03.201
GlassFart

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:13.172
My intention with getting the Google Glass is to try it out and see if I can make anything really cool with the additional sensors and the fact that the device is worn on a person’s head.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:18.787
I was really struggling with what to start working on, and then it hit me: a fart app.

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:24.561
I was actually working on a Dragonball Z Scouter app, but that was going to be too complicated.

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:31.454
I found that you can insert your own “Okay Glass” prompts to start an app, so I figured I’d make a hello world fart app.

00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:38.447
The history of fart apps on advanced mobile operating systems is a long one, so I won’t go over all that.

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:44.381
Suffice it to say I am proud to have written the first (as far as I know) native fart app for Google Glass.

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:47.039
Here’s a video of me demonstrating it:

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.993
Having played around with the GDK a bit, and the device a bit more, I am still not sure if I will keep it.

00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:55.811
The $1500 price tag is one factor.

00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.188
The public acceptance of the device is another.

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:02.724
My opinions on my previous Glass post still hold.

00:02:03.224 --> 00:02:09.218
If anything, the opportunity is definitely worth the $1500 “loan” to Google plus return shipping.

00:02:10.218 --> 00:02:11.256
Contest

00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:18.350
Before I even got my first Google Glass invite, I went to a GDG Android meeting in Ann Arbor.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.926
The organizer had some spare Glass invites, so I asked for one.

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:31.097
I hadn’t heard back about the invite, but after ordering my Glass from my original invites, I got another one from the GDG group’s pool.

00:02:31.597 --> 00:02:39.109
I figured I’d give it away, and to drum up interest in the fart app, I’m going to make a tweet and ask users to retweet it for a chance to win.

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.744
To celebrate my Google Glass fart app, I'm running a contest to win a Glass invite!

00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:52.517
