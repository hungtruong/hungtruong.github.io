WSJ Article About Social Computing + Me!

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.500
Published on May 29, 2007.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.540
A few weeks ago, a guy by the name of Andrew LaVallee from the WSJ emailed me to see if I could answer some questions about social computing.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.720
I guess he found my blog, either my personal one or the grad school one, and noticed that I was going to be in the University of Michigan SI program.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.440
I answered his questions, and tried to do so without sounding uninformed.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:37.540
I was seriously worried that I’d betray my intelligence and say something stupid, which would be republished and used against me for the rest of my life.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.160
Today, the article was published , and luckily, I don’t really sound like a moron, per se.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.280
I figured he might mention my name and quote me or something, but he actually gave my background and stuff too!

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.420
Pretty neat! Maybe I qualify as being famous now?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.360
Anyway, the article isn’t only about me (duh).

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.660
It describes the increase the interest levels that schools are having in social computing programs.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.440
I was actually thinking of applying to RIT, one of the schools mentioned in the article.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.440
I was quoted as saying that social computing was more into real life applications with computer science being more ambiguous.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.180
I just checked, and indeed, I did write that!

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.320
But I later elaborated, saying that the SI was more of a depth program while CS is very breadth oriented, at least at the undergrad level.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.820
I think that better captures my feelings on the differences of the programs.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.460
Computer science is a really great subject to get a foundation in working with computers: programming and algorithms.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.760
Once I got that degree, I felt like I wanted to do something more specific and less abstract.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.500
Now that I think of it, I really meant “abstract” when I wrote “ambiguous.” Oops!

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.740
Either way, I think the article is way cool, so be sure to check it out !
