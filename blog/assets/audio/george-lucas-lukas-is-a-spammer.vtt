So while looking through my akismet spam filter entries for false positives (usually I don’t really care, but I thought, what the heck), I found this post from one George Lukas:

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.260
Apparently, when he’s not destroying Star Wars or wearing flannel, he’s trying to sell hair loss cures.

Thanks, but no thanks, Georgie.
