The Internet Is For… Downtime.

00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:05.975
Published on April 25, 2011.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:10.571
These last few weeks have been really, really bad for the internet.

00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:12.429
I mean, in general.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:24.837
What with Media Temple going down due to their nameservers , Amazon EC2 going down , and also the Playstation Network refusing to let me log in … You’d think there was a cyberattack going on or something.

00:00:25.837 --> 00:00:30.152
My websites did not manage to dodge all of the bullets either.

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:33.689
A few sites were down from the Media Temple thing.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:37.306
I also inadvertently broke a few sites here and there.

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:44.358
After the Media Temple downtime, I wanted to try updating a few Ruby Gems to get Passenger Phusion working.

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:52.370
Unfortunately my rails apps hadn’t been updated in forever, so updating things broke backwards compatibility.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.224
I’ve been working on getting Anime Nano back to full capacity on the newest version of Rails.

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:03.439
I think the whole experience was a bit stressful, but probably ended up being good in the long run.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.035
I was also surprised to see Mapskrieg going down late last week.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:14.129
Apparently I hadn’t verified the domain for Google Apps and Google decided to close my account.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.905
The one that was serving Mapskrieg via App Engine.

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:28.075
This was really annoying since all of the “act now or we’ll delete your account” emails were classified as spam in gmail and I am pretty sure I had verified the account previously.

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:30.973
If Google doesn’t want my money then screw them.

00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:36.907
I figure I can actually serve the site for cheaper than App Engine since a few other apps live on the same server.

00:01:37.407 --> 00:01:44.119
The App Engine thing was a fun experiment but there are still too many limitations in the datastore to base a real app on it.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:52.611
Specifically, datastore writes cost way too much and indexes take way too much overhead in disk space (which you eventually need to pay for).

00:01:53.611 --> 00:02:01.283
So now I’m back to running most sites on Media Temple, though I may diversify in case Media Temple continues to have downtime issues.

00:02:01.783 --> 00:02:08.176
It was a stressful few days, but at least I got to practice my sysadmin skills a bit and update my server in the process.
