State of the Hung Truong Google Search Query, 3/2009

00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:08.612
Published on March 29, 2009.

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:15.446
While it feels as though there’s not many Hung Truongs out there (I’ve never met another one), there actually are.

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:19.622
So I’m pretty protective of my Google query position for my name.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:25.875
I haven’t been doing a good job of recording my past performance to measure against future performance, though.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:32.848
So here’s my current standing on the top 10 results on Google for “Hung Truong” (I logged out to get these results).

00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:37.364
Results 1 and 2 are this blog and my portfolio, respectively.

00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:46.016
Sweet! 3 is Hung Truong on Facebook, but it’s not me. I wonder how Google arbitrarily picks a Facebook profile of a Hung Truong.

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:50.911
Oh well. I don’t need people finding my (private) Facebook profile anyway.

00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:53.249
4 is my Twitter profile.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.664
5 is a LinkedIn profile of a Hung Truong that isn’t me either.

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:02.580
6 is a link to a person wiki of some kind called “AboutUs.”

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.276
It’s basically an auto-generated wiki about my portfolio.

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:09.254
I’ll count this as one in my favor.

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:14.388
7 is a news story about the Hung Truong that killed a police officer!

00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:18.564
Hopefully I don’t have to remind you, but that Hung Truong is not me !

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:24.179
8 is a weird PDF about a Hung Truong who broke some laws by selling herbal medicine.

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:25.638
Again, not me!

00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:31.092
9 is a CNet page about me, my portfolio and Notecentric, for some reason.

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:35.348
10 is a page about a Dentist named Hung Truong.

00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:41.942
So I have the top 2 results for “Hung Truong” and 5/10 results are about me in some way.

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:43.481
Not too bad!

00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:51.413
Hopefully if anyone does happen to mistake me for another Hung Truong, it’ll be for the dentist or the wireless entrepreneur and not the cop killa!
