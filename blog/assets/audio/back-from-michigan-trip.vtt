00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Back From Michigan Trip!

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.900
Published on May 28, 2007.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.900
I just got back from the trip to Michigan.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.640
I fit quite a lot into the trip, visiting a lot of landmarks and whatnot.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.720
My sister’s friend Juli was nice enough to pick me up from the airport and show me around the town the first day I was there.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.660
After that, I met up with Adam, another SI grad student who I met at visiting days.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.640
So me, Adam, and Adam’s wife sorta just wandered around for a few days.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.480
Let’s see… I went to Pinball Pete’s and played some kind of light gun game in Japanese starring a bunch of cats shooting at ghosts… or something like that.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.260
It was really easy, which means it’s probably a kid’s game.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.440
I beat all of the levels and then it gave me a game over thing.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.360
I walked around campus a lot.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.820
Saw stuff like the fish bowl and the cube , and other random stuff I didn’t see during visiting days.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.560
I also got my MCard, which is just the university student id card.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.500
I wore my red Google shirt, then realized I wore Ohio State colors!!! NOOOO!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.080
I might need to get them to replace it with me wearing a yellow shirt or something.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.120
I went to the Hatcher Graduate Library to finish up all of the paperwork for my job with the university.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.980
Glad that’s over with.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.280
I had to sign something and get it “notorized.”

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.220
Luckily, one of the people in the administrative offices is a notary public, so I just had her “witness” me sign the paper.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.940
Of course, I also went to look at apartments.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.240
There were some pretty crappy ones and some nice ones.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.540
There was one that was super nice in the middle of Kerrytown right above a Smoothie King!

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800
But there wasn’t any parking nearby.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.380
I’m pretty sure that I’ll be going with the Nob Hill apartments , since they seem decent and they’re only about a mile away from campus.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.640
So they’re sort of a good compromise between price, distance, and quality.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.400
One of the realty companies I went to look at apartments with, Varsity Management, seemed kind of creepy.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.300
Like we just went to apartments that still had people living in them, then we knocked on the door to see if they were home.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.360
And they weren’t so we just went in.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.660
I felt like I was in some kind of cop show or something.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.120
Like I was scared there’d be bodies or dead hookers, etc.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.580
Apparently it’s part of the lease agreement, but that seems like a pretty crappy lease agreement.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.380
There’s an Ikea in Canton, which is like 20 minutes or so from Ann Arbor.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.400
We went twice.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.660
That’s how much I like Ikea.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.880
The second time we went, I even bought a few random office organization thingys.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.580
I’m probably going to Ikea again next week when I go visit my brother in California… and buy more random stuff.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.820
We also hit some pretty cool restaurants.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.880
Like umm… well, the only one I can remember is Champion House, where they do that Japanese cooking thing in front of you.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.420
It was pretty neat.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.280
Way expensive, though.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.260
But tasty. I suspect that our cook was Chinese, though, and not Japanese.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.520
Which is cool either way.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.120
And I guess that’s it.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.180
Overall, it was a pretty fun trip, though somewhat stressful due to the quality (or lack thereof) of apartments.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.480
I guess I should’ve prepared for crapiness, but still, seeing it in person is quite harsh.
