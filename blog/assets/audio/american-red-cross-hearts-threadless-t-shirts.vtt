So I guess the American Red Cross had a contest going with Threadless.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.080
There’s three shirts which, when bought, will cause a donation of $5 to the Red Cross.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.540
Pretty cool, but none of these shirts are really bitchin’ or anything.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.880
The Florence Nightingale is probably the only one I’d buy if it were $10 instead… Have a look anyway, though, it’s for a good cause after all:

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.320
St.George VS the Dragon

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.180
Florence Nightingale

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.720
