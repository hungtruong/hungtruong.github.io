00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.740
For some reason, Bill Clinton, Bill Richardson, Jeff Bingaman, and Marty Chavez all called my house today!

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.880
It’s like we’re some kind of important political family!

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.060
Seriously, does the Kennedy household even get this kind of attention?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.340
Unfortunately, I didn’t pick up the phone, but all of those highly important political people took the time to leave messages on my answering machine.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.200
I feel so honored!

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.540
I’m never deleting those messages!

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.860
All I can say is get out there and vote.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.760
If Bill Clinton has the time to call up little ol’ me, then I can tell you for a fact that every single vote counts!

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.880
I’m Hung Truong, and I approve this message.
