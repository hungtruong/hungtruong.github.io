SXSW Panel Idea: Mashups – Noble Bootstrapping or Downright Stealing?

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:11.249
Published on July 22, 2012.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:17.364
I checked SXSW today and noticed that the deadline for panel proposals is tonight.

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:24.976
I originally wasn’t going to post anything, but I sat and thought for a bit about things I know enough about to propose/speak about at a conference.

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:32.588
I remembered the whole craigslist incident and thought it would be interesting to propose a panel discussion about the state of mashups today.

00:00:33.588 --> 00:00:36.785
In the past, mashups were held to a pretty high opinion.

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:42.239
The proper mashup might be able to take two things and simplify a process to critical acclaim.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.372
I think in those days, mashups weren’t thought of as startups or businesses, just small tools that people could use.

00:00:49.872 --> 00:00:58.903
Flash forward to today and sites like Mapskrieg and Padmapper (and others like AirBnB) are being C&Ded for their terms of use violations.

00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:06.115
Something happened in the startup world that made mashups into a viable threat, which the bigger players did not approve of.

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:13.668
While the term “mashup” seems a bit archaic now, I think it would be interesting to revisit that term and see what it means today.

00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:18.164
Take some pioneers of mashing up and some new startups and get them talking about stuff.

00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:26.436
In other news, it looks like the Panel Picker requires some kind of “visual resource” like a video or slideshow or something.

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:36.526
I don’t see how my proposal could be improved by that (it’s pretty cut and dry) so I’ll probably just link to this blog post and insert a lot of unrelated pictures of things being mashed up.
