Fly Me To The Mars

00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:05.336
Published on April 20, 2010.

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:10.091
I had a dream last night that me and my Mom won a trip to Mars.

00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:17.784
I think we won a contest that allowed us to take a tourist flight to Mars, kind of like how people are paying big bucks to fly into orbit right now.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:27.314
When we got onto the shuttle (which seemed kind of small and had a random tour guide driving, like it was a bus), I realized that it’d probably take a while to get there.

00:00:27.814 --> 00:00:29.812
Like, more than 24 hours.

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:32.709
I think that was a low estimate…

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:41.461
At this point I really wish I had done more preparation for the trip, like maybe getting some audiobooks loaded up or at least bringing a book to read.

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:46.836
I kinda just showed up (my Mom might’ve caused us to be late; this happens in real life).

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:49.813
During our trip I kept feeling kind of dreadful.

00:00:50.313 --> 00:00:54.548
Like, what if we don’t come back (it was the first ever tourist trip to Mars)?

00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:58.324
And what if our pilot bus driver guy gets killed?

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:06.117
Our bus driver/guide said that once we get to Mars, it’ll be really small, so we all have to keep our eyes peeled for it.

00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:10.613
I thought this was a load of crap, because it’s actually a pretty big planet!

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:16.866
I think this also meant that we wouldn’t actually go onto Mars; we’d just fly over and look at it, and then go home.

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:22.661
I guess we didn’t go directly to Mars; we stopped at a space station or something first.

00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:26.517
In the space station we had to form a huge line, for some reason.

00:01:27.017 --> 00:01:30.933
I remember reading some really specific headlines when glancing at a newspaper.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:35.748
One was about how the space library was charging really huge fees for interlibrary loan .

00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:39.125
Makes sense if your library is in space, I guess.
