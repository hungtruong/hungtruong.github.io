New Threadless $10 T-Shirt Sale ’til Wednesday

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.660
Published on October 23, 2006.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.260
Whoa, so there’s finally a $10 sale at threadless.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.800
I was waiting for one so I could buy Pandamonium.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.980
I ended up buying a few:

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.180
Pandamonium

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.380
So I already have this shirt, but it’s red and XL.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.560
I wear L shirts now, so I wanted to have a Pandamonium that’ll fit me.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.020
It’s pretty awesome.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.800
It has a Panda destroying stuff. Yeah.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.000
Fire and Ice

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.840
This shirt is just kinda cute.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.740
Seriously, who doesn’t like penguins?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.840
Somehow, I don’t think the penguin who is encased in ice will survive, but I’m still rooting for him!

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.900
Maybe they can perform penguin CPR quickly…

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.180
Rocketbird

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.580
Rocketbird has a bird on a rocket.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.120
Perhaps this bird is of the flightless variety, and therefore cannot fly on its own volition.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.740
Or perhaps the bird is in a hurry and needs the power of a rocket pack to reach his destination.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.880
It really doesn’t matter; Rocketbird is cool.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.200
There were a few other cool shirts that were in stock in other sizes, or shirts that I already have (and maybe have already bought twice!).

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.100
Check out Ctrl+Z (my favorite), MP(3) , and the whole catalog in general.
