Anime Nano, na no!

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.220
Published on June 01, 2006.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.420
And now for a little “What I did during my Summer vacation.”

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.680
Well, I’ve been brushing up on my ‘gramming skills. And I’m pretty much done with my first web app. It’s called Anime Nano .

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.180
As in “Anime, na no.”

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.000
I know, only two or so of you will get that.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.720
Basically, It’s an anime blog feed indexer.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.100
There’s also a forum in there that I wrote in a day.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.480
Since its grand opening on midnight, quite a few anime blogs have joined in on the action.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.240
For those who are interested, it’s written purely in Ruby on Rails.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.860
I learned the language, learned some css skills, and wrote the project in about 3 weeks.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.160
RoR is a cool way to produce web application code in an Object Oriented paradigm.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.980
I’m losing most of you, aren’t I?

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.140
My next web app is still a secret, but I’ll let you know when that hits.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.240
For now, visit AnimeNano at http://www.animenano.com and let me know what you think.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.780
Is it ugly?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.720
Is it cute?

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.580
Is it teh suck?

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.920
Perhaps all of the above…
