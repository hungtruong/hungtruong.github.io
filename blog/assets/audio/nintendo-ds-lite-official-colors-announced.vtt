Nintendo DS lite Official Colors Announced

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.900
Published on February 10, 2006.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.620
Yep, the new colors have been announced :

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.420
Crystal White

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.100
Ice Blue

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.020
Enamel Navy

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:31.940
Why they couldn’t announce Lime Green is beyond me. I have the lime green Game Boy Color and the Donkey Kong special edition green Game Boy Advance SP, so all I really need now is a lime green DS lite!

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.880
Please, Nintendo, grant this poor fanboy’s wish!

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.620
Make the lime green DS lite!

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.640
It’ll look so awesome:

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.000
“I love the Lime Green DS lite, it’s so bad!”
