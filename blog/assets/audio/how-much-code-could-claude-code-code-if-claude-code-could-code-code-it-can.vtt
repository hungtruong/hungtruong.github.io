How Much Code Could Claude Code Code if Claude Code Could Code Code? (It Can!)

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:09.012
Published on July 15, 2025.

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:18.722
Previously on my blog, I wrote about vibe coding and how I was experimenting with Google CLI, the free agentic AI thing that runs in your command line.

00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:24.257
I talked about how cool it was, but also how I was too cheap to try anything that cost money.

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:33.708
After repeatedly hearing about how good Claude Code was, I decided to scrounge up the last few dollars I had in my vast money bin and spent $20 on Claude Pro.

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:35.326
So was it worth it?

00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:37.424
Heck yeah it was!

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:39.762
Claude Code is my new best friend!

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:42.281
What is Claude Code?

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:50.333
Claude Code is Anthropic’s official CLI tool that brings Claude’s coding capabilities directly to your terminal.

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:59.145
It’s a lot like the Google Gemini CLI that I talked about before, but it actually has brains and doesn’t get stuck in an infinite loop constantly for no reason.

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:08.915
Previously, when I tried using the Gemini CLI, it would mostly hit rate limits, switch to the flash version of the model, and generally be bad at doing things.

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:13.171
Even with the degraded quality, I still found some use for it, though.

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:17.426
But I knew that if I wanted to be a true Vibe Coder, I’d have to upgrade.

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:23.141
Claude Code uses Claude Sonnet 4 which is apparently really good at code.

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:25.879
So far I’ve used it to:

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:27.438
Code:

00:01:28.938 --> 00:01:32.454
I added automated testing with playwright to Animenano

00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:39.128
Optimized Animenano RSS feed parsing by caching etag/last-modified headers

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:45.882
Wrote a script to sync the remote Animenano Cloudflare D1 database for testing locally

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:53.275
Added some tools to my LiveKit AI agent that I was messing around with, like a Japanese phrase guessing game

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:57.231
Vibe coded search on my blog on a plane!

00:01:57.731 --> 00:01:59.649
( I actually made a video for this! )

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.446
Set up staticman for comments on my blog!

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:08.362
Changed the comment form on my blog from a hard reload to an AJAX update!

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:14.876
Wrote a script to scrape comments from my blog posts on archive.org to replenish my missing comments!

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:16.595
Other:

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:22.730
Documentation for my various side projects, instead of leaving the readme blank

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.283
Set up wireguard on my opnsense, Claude Code helped me debug why I couldn’t access the network until it worked!

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:39.114
Added documentation on how I set up mdns and nginx on a home server to serve stuff on the network, and added some more hosts

00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:44.110
The “Other” category is honestly a really cool unlock for me personally.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.482
I have a bunch of home servers that do random stuff like run cron jobs of scripts for automation and other really random things.

00:02:51.982 --> 00:03:04.450
I usually just write one-off implementations based on quick searches of how to do things (like setting up mdns and nginx to redirect example.local domains to 10.0.0.111:8000 for example).

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:17.737
Inevitably, I’ll forget how I set something up (like when I set up a launchd daemon thing) and it becomes this tech debt where it becomes really difficult to fix or change anything if something breaks or I need to set it up again a different way.

00:03:18.737 --> 00:03:29.206
With Claude Code, I can just have it read the files and figure out how things work, then write a README.md that describes in plain language how it’s set up, how to use it, and how to modify it.

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:38.257
Claude Code is incredible for side projects and these sorts of things where you naturally don’t put the same amount of rigor into documentation as you would for professional work.

00:03:38.757 --> 00:03:46.988
It takes the boring parts of fun projects and automates them, so you have more time to start even more side projects that may or may not ever be finished!

00:03:47.988 --> 00:03:50.226
There’s a Plan For HOW MUCH?

00:03:51.726 --> 00:04:03.234
I’ve been seeing a lot of posts online about how people are YOLOing their wallets and buying the $200 a month Claude Max plan , which includes 20x the amount of requests that you can make with the Pro plan (which I’m currently on).

00:04:03.734 --> 00:04:10.447
I suppose that if I was using Claude Code for my job, and it was on a super large codebase, that might make some sense.

00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:13.104
But honestly, it seems a bit excessive.

00:04:13.604 --> 00:04:21.116
For an experienced software engineer, coding is probably like 10% of what you actually do, and the rest is reading code and planning what to do.

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:32.725
I guess Claude can help with that too, but it just seems like the guys who are running 8 subagents simultaneously and racking up the Claude Code tokens could really just learn to git gud at software engineering.

00:04:33.225 --> 00:04:35.542
Or as the kids would say, Skill Issue!

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:39.638
They’re obviously just karma farming because who actually does that!?

00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:49.668
I guess one additional bonus of that ridiculous MAX plan is that you have access to the Opus 4 model, which may or may not be named after that penguin from the 80s.

00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:57.521
I already feel like I can accomplish pretty much whatever using Sonnet, but I guess that if I hit too many roadblocks, it might be interesting to at least try Opus.

00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:12.667
I do think I made a pretty good decision paying for the $20 plan as I rarely hit the rate limit anyway, and I’ve been using this tool called ccusage to see how much I’d be paying if I was using the pay-as-you-go style of token based API usage.

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:22.377
This image doesn’t completely reflect my usage because it’s divided between like 3 different computers, and the tool only shows usage for the computer it’s running on.

00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:27.432
And I’m too lazy to go run it on all of them right now to see how much I actually used.

00:05:27.932 --> 00:05:35.684
On top of that, I think the Claude Code Github Actions stuff uses your Pro Plan quota, so that’s not showing up in the numbers either.

00:05:36.684 --> 00:05:40.919
I plan on continuing to use Claude Code and paying for the subscription for now.

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.974
I started it on July 1st and I’ve already gotten my money’s worth for the month.

00:05:46.474 --> 00:05:55.185
To be honest, I have a suspicion based on the token usage image above that this price is heavily subsidized, kinda like how Uber and Lyft rides used to be super cheap.

00:05:55.685 --> 00:06:00.640
Though with those things, you’d have to pay a person, and with Claude, you just need to pay to run a server.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:08.332
Hopefully servers get cheaper or more efficient, but even so, it’s hard to believe that this much utility can come at such a low price.

00:06:08.832 --> 00:06:11.069
Maybe I should be more bullish about AI.

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:20.301
I should probably report back in a month or so to see if I run out of things to use CC on, or if I just keep using it as frequently as I am now.

00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:22.878
For now though, I’m totally bought into the hype.

00:06:23.378 --> 00:06:24.896
Claude Code forever!

00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:26.855
BTW

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:31.951
Also, I’m still using this AI stuff to help me write my blog.

00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:38.125
None of the actual words were written using AI, but I did use it to help me be extremely lazy.

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:47.416
For example, the image I made at the top of this blog (which was sorta generated with AI but also hand edited) was plopped into the root directory of my Jekyll repo.

00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:52.151
I then told AI to put it in the right directory, and make a link and a caption to it.

00:06:52.651 --> 00:06:59.763
I did the same with the screenshot of the ccusage tool, and I also told the AI to resize it since it was kinda big.

00:07:00.263 --> 00:07:04.978
It used a command line tool and got it to 150kb from 650kb.

00:07:05.478 --> 00:07:11.072
Interestingly, I tried asking it to add some alt text to the images in this post for accessibility.

00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:16.926
It did an okay job at first but I kept nudging it, and now the images are a lot more accessible.

00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:24.459
I also had it add some links within the post, which I could totally do myself, but why should I do it if AI can do it for me?

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:27.137
To me, that’s the whole point of AI.

00:07:27.637 --> 00:07:35.548
I enjoy writing blog posts and getting my thoughts out there, but wrangling images and formatting captions brings me no joy; it’s just friction.

00:07:36.048 --> 00:07:43.400
AI is helping me be creative and express myself, without taking away the soul of the process of creation, which is the way it should be.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:50.054
I’m sure I’ll think of more ways to use AI, but for now this is getting me really excited about the possibilities!
