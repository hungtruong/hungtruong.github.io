Five Simple Steps to Becoming an International™ Conference Speaker!

00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:07.174
Published on May 20, 2018.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:11.849
A few years ago, I made a goal for myself that I would start speaking at

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.825
conferences. In the past I had gone to quite a few awesome conferences and I

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:21.080
really admired the folks who could get on a stage, share a bunch of knowledge

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.217
and inspire an audience to do cool stuff.

00:00:24.717 --> 00:00:27.035
While I had a bit of experience with

00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:32.409
public speaking (I spoke at some local iOS/Android meetups and moderated two

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:38.983
panels at SXSW back in ’11 and ’13), I wanted to try for a “real” conference spot.

00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:43.898
I think the conference that convinced me to start applying was Swift Summit,

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:46.396
which I attended in 2015.

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:50.172
There were a number of really inspiring talks, and the

00:00:50.672 --> 00:00:53.469
community felt really fresh and welcoming.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.766
One interesting aside: I learned

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:02.221
after joining Lyft that no fewer than three of my current coworkers on iOS spoke

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.079
at that conference (Keith,

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.536
Sam and JP, though only Keith was working

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:11.712
at Lyft at the time) and a few others attended that year.

00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:13.490
I’m not sure if that’s

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.988
correlation or causation at work.

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:18.906
Step 1: Applying to speak

00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:25.040
According to my Google Doc which keeps track of my CFP applications, I started

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.778
applying heavily in 2016.

00:01:28.278 --> 00:01:31.315
There was a gap between when I wanted to apply and

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:35.570
when I started to apply simply because I felt I didn’t have much to talk about.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.386
Once I had some interesting experience with iMessage and accessibility while

00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:45.121
working at Starbucks, I figured people might want to know about those things,

00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:48.657
too. In retrospect I think I probably waited too long.

00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:50.116
If you are passionate

00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:54.292
about something, don’t wait until you feel you’re an expert on the subject.

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:59.427
That day probably (at least for me) will never come, and you can always do research

00:01:59.927 --> 00:02:02.244
about your topic once it’s been accepted!

00:02:03.244 --> 00:02:07.799
In all of my CFPs I use a template which I learned about during my time in the

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.057
Twilio Heroes program.

00:02:10.557 --> 00:02:11.916
Essentially, you need to:

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:16.832
Here’s an example of my iMessage talk, which used that template:

00:02:17.832 --> 00:02:21.587
(1) Messaging apps are huge and getting huger.

00:02:22.087 --> 00:02:24.325
With WhatsApp, WeChat and

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:28.820
Facebook Messenger users in the millions or billions, it’s clear that messaging

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.158
is not a fad.

00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:34.215
So how can a developer take advantage of this growth?

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:38.711
(2) Starting a new messaging app is probably out of the question.

00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.608
(3) Thankfully, Apple has

00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:45.464
introduced iMessage app extensions in iOS 10.

00:02:45.964 --> 00:02:48.362
Learn how to use iMessage to let

00:02:48.862 --> 00:02:53.097
your users send rich, interactive messages, and learn how to take advantage of

00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:58.232
the network effects that iMessage app extensions allow, including updates

00:02:58.732 --> 00:03:03.447
introduced in iOS 11 like Live Message Layouts and the Direct Send API.

00:03:04.447 --> 00:03:06.604
Step 2: Getting rejected

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:12.579
After using this template for talks and applying to pretty much every iOS

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.714
related conference in 2016, I ended up getting a ton of rejections.

00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:23.249
This is totally fine and to be expected since I think most conferences get way more talk

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:25.746
proposals than they have spots.

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:29.043
I also noticed that conferences tend to invite

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:33.539
speakers who have spoken before, which is a form of risk management but also

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.516
kind of unfair for people who have never spoken.

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:42.151
The best way to beat this sort of chicken and egg situation is probably to aim

00:03:42.651 --> 00:03:46.247
at local meetups which are always looking for people to give talks!

00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:51.302
Another benefit of this is that you get to practice your talk and refine it before

00:03:51.802 --> 00:03:55.318
taking it to a bigger stage and audience (which is exactly what I did for my

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:59.573
accessibility talk that I gave at iOSCon in London this year).

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.192
Because I had

00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:05.928
given my talk at an Xcoders meeting two weeks before the conference, I was able

00:04:06.428 --> 00:04:10.663
to time my talk, practice it in front of people, get their questions to

00:04:11.163 --> 00:04:15.398
incorporate back into the talk, and feel like I was ready once I spoke in front

00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:17.097
of a larger crowd.

00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:20.734
Step 3: Getting accepted

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:26.069
The first year I really started getting serious about applying to conferences,

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.206
my acceptance rate was 1 of 7¹.

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:32.583
Success! I attended the first

00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:35.720
CodeMobile conference in Chester, UK and talked

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.579
about iMessage apps.

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:41.195
The experience of going on stage, sharing something I

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:45.851
thought was interesting, and then getting feedback that it actually was

00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:48.588
interesting to people was great!

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.885
The attendees were all amazing and I finally

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:55.901
got to travel outside of North America for the first time in my life.

00:04:56.401 --> 00:05:00.396
I had reached my goals and become an International™ Speaker as well as generally

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:04.173
becoming an iOS Conference Speaker all in one go.

00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:07.250
Step 4: Preparation

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.826
The thing that most people don’t tell you, and the thing that you quickly find

00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:17.241
out when preparing a conference talk is how much work it is to prepare!

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:22.936
As an audience member to some great talks, I always assumed that the talk took maybe a

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:25.833
handful of hours to prepare and format.

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:31.388
In practice, a talk can take something like 40–50 hours for a 45 minute session.

00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:35.644
That includes coming up with the proposal, learning about the subject (often

00:05:36.144 --> 00:05:39.500
this happens after the proposal has been accepted!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.358
), coming up with a format

00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:46.014
that will educate and inspire (and hopefully entertain) your audience, and

00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:49.151
practicing the delivery of the material.

00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:51.968
You probably also want to tailor your

00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:56.384
presentation for the audience you’re speaking to; are they mostly students?

00:05:56.884 --> 00:05:59.681
What skill level would be most appropriate to present to?

00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:01.699
What kinds of jokes might

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.037
work well with your audience?

00:06:05.037 --> 00:06:08.793
A good amount of the time that I put into preparing talks is practicing.

00:06:09.293 --> 00:06:13.528
It’s really up to you how polished you want the talk to be, and how comfortable you

00:06:14.028 --> 00:06:17.304
will be presenting with the amount of practice you’ve put into it.

00:06:17.804 --> 00:06:22.359
As I mentioned before, presenting early to a smaller group can really help by

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:26.775
creating a deadline that is sooner than the actual talk and providing a method

00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:30.551
of gathering feedback to tweak your talk to make it even better.

00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:35.467
One thing that’s great about having a conference talk lined up is that you can

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:38.844
do some pretty productive stuff while procrastinating.

00:06:39.344 --> 00:06:40.542
In order to avoid

00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:45.997
preparing my iOSCon talk, I applied to speak at a conference in New York called

00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:52.250
!! Con. That application ended up getting accepted, so I started down a pretty

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.787
vicious cycle of speaking at more conferences!

00:06:56.787 --> 00:07:00.862
I recently came across this Twitter thread of many speakers sharing their

00:07:01.362 --> 00:07:03.999
process and how much time they put into their talks:

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:09.554
Hey, people who talk at things:How long does it take you to put a new talk together?

00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:13.970
I need like 50 hours over at least a couple of months to make something I don't hate.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.824
I'm trying to get that down (maybe by not doing pictures?) but wondering what's normal for everyone else.

00:07:20.824 --> 00:07:22.742
Step 5: Actually presenting

00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:27.358
Giving the actual talk is kind of a weird experience.

00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:29.457
After putting a ton of

00:07:29.957 --> 00:07:35.151
time into a talk upfront, I’ve found that the actual talk goes by faster than I

00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:36.290
think it will.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.866
Once I get up and start talking, I’m more or less on autopilot,

00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:44.242
and it’s almost like having an out of body experience.

00:07:44.742 --> 00:07:46.341
It might be because I put

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:51.316
all of my brain power into giving the talk, but I can’t even really remember how

00:07:51.816 --> 00:07:53.733
I did once it’s done.

00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:57.270
Then at the end everyone claps and hopefully people ask

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:02.005
insightful questions and no one asks a question that’s really just a statement

00:08:02.505 --> 00:08:05.142
that they’re trying to use to prove that they know something.

00:08:06.142 --> 00:08:09.499
Once I’ve given the talk, I can actually enjoy the conference.

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:11.037
I’ve been lucky

00:08:11.537 --> 00:08:16.572
that the first few conferences I’ve spoken at, I was the first speaker after the

00:08:17.072 --> 00:08:19.549
keynote speaker on the first day.

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:23.006
Going earlier is also nice because then people

00:08:23.506 --> 00:08:27.341
have seen you talk and they’re usually more open about chatting with you in the hallway.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.460
Presenting some more

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.036
After speaking at CodeMobile in Chester, UK, I

00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:38.093
didn’t get any talks accepted for about a year.

00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:40.591
I ended up speaking again in the

00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:43.088
UK, this time in London for

00:08:43.588 --> 00:08:46.225
iOSCon in March of 2018.

00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:49.122
Then I most recently spoke at !!

00:08:49.622 --> 00:08:51.700
Con in New York in May.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.716
I’ll be giving an updated version of my iOS accessibility

00:08:56.216 --> 00:08:58.773
talk in Boston next month for SwiftFest.

00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:04.408
This time around my acceptance rate was 3/6, which is much better.

00:09:04.908 --> 00:09:08.904
I would mostly chalk this up to the fact that I gave a talk at CodeMobile last year.

00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:13.239
I also applied to some more diverse types of tech conferences since there were

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:18.534
fewer iOS specific ones (I think a few that I applied to didn’t actually happen).

00:09:19.534 --> 00:09:23.849
In the future, I hope I can speak again but with the three consecutive talks I’m

00:09:24.349 --> 00:09:28.585
doing in March/May/June this year, I’m ready for a little break before I get

00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:31.402
back on the conference speaking circuit.

00:09:31.902 --> 00:09:33.900
I’m really happy that I’ve been given

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.315
the opportunity to share some of my experiences and the conferences I’ve been to

00:09:38.815 --> 00:09:40.973
have been really enjoyable so far.

00:09:41.973 --> 00:09:43.971
You should talk, too!

00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:49.786
When I first set my personal goal to talk at some conferences, I really wasn’t

00:09:50.286 --> 00:09:52.683
sure if I had what it would take to succeed.

00:09:53.183 --> 00:09:55.021
I don’t consider myself a great

00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:59.517
public speaker, nor would I consider myself to be an exceptional software

00:10:00.017 --> 00:10:05.371
engineer. The secret is that neither is really a requirement to share cool stuff

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:10.106
with people. You just need to have some passion for something and effectively

00:10:10.606 --> 00:10:13.802
communicate that passion by telling your story.

00:10:14.802 --> 00:10:19.197
If you’re looking for iOS conferences to apply to, there’s a well maintained

00:10:19.697 --> 00:10:21.615
list along with CFP deadlines

00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:23.554
here. Good luck!

00:10:24.554 --> 00:10:27.590
Finally, if you see me at a conference, say hi!

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.529
I’m always happy to chat with

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:33.784
people, even if I look like I’m busy or focused on other stuff.

00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:38.620
¹Actually I ended up getting another talk accepted but the conference was not

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.075
interested in reimbursing me for any travel expenses so I politely declined.

00:10:44.575 --> 00:10:49.130
Given the amount of time it takes to prepare a good presentation, a conference

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.347
should absolutely reimburse you for speaking.
