Five Simple Steps to Becoming an International™ Conference Speaker!

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:07.573
Published on May 20, 2018.

00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:12.729
A few years ago, I made a goal for myself that I would start speaking at conferences.

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:22.419
In the past I had gone to quite a few awesome conferences and I really admired the folks who could get on a stage, share a bunch of knowledge and inspire an audience to do cool stuff.

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:34.507
While I had a bit of experience with public speaking (I spoke at some local iOS/Android meetups and moderated two panels at SXSW back in ’11 and ’13), I wanted to try for a “real” conference spot.

00:00:35.507 --> 00:00:41.101
I think the conference that convinced me to start applying was Swift Summit, which I attended in 2015.

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:46.795
There were a number of really inspiring talks, and the community felt really fresh and welcoming.

00:00:47.295 --> 00:01:01.441
One interesting aside: I learned after joining Lyft that no fewer than three of my current coworkers on iOS spoke at that conference ( Keith , Sam and JP , though only Keith was working at Lyft at the time) and a few others attended that year.

00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:05.217
I’m not sure if that’s correlation or causation at work.

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:08.455
Step 1: Applying to speak

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:16.748
According to my Google Doc which keeps track of my CFP applications, I started applying heavily in 2016.

00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:23.481
There was a gap between when I wanted to apply and when I started to apply simply because I felt I didn’t have much to talk about.

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:32.052
Once I had some interesting experience with iMessage and accessibility while working at Starbucks, I figured people might want to know about those things, too.

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:35.509
In retrospect I think I probably waited too long.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.404
If you are passionate about something, don’t wait until you feel you’re an expert on the subject.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:47.377
That day probably (at least for me) will never come, and you can always do research about your topic once it’s been accepted!

00:01:48.377 --> 00:01:54.690
In all of my CFPs I use a template which I learned about during my time in the Twilio Heroes program.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.469
Essentially, you need to:

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.466
State a problem or challenge

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:03.583
Give some general solutions (set up a straw man)

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:09.138
Give your specific solution that is better than #2, because you are awesome.

00:02:10.138 --> 00:02:13.814
Here’s an example of my iMessage talk, which used that template:

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:18.490
(1) Messaging apps are huge and getting huger.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.862
With WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook Messenger users in the millions or billions, it’s clear that messaging is not a fad.

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:29.319
So how can a developer take advantage of this growth?

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.374
(2) Starting a new messaging app is probably out of the question.

00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:40.068
(3) Thankfully, Apple has introduced iMessage app extensions in iOS 10.

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:54.714
Learn how to use iMessage to let your users send rich, interactive messages, and learn how to take advantage of the network effects that iMessage app extensions allow, including updates introduced in iOS 11 like Live Message Layouts and the Direct Send API.

00:02:55.714 --> 00:02:57.951
Step 2: Getting rejected

00:02:59.451 --> 00:03:08.242
After using this template for talks and applying to pretty much every iOS related conference in 2016, I ended up getting a ton of rejections.

00:03:08.742 --> 00:03:14.656
This is totally fine and to be expected since I think most conferences get way more talk proposals than they have spots.

00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:23.946
I also noticed that conferences tend to invite speakers who have spoken before, which is a form of risk management but also kind of unfair for people who have never spoken.

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:32.139
The best way to beat this sort of chicken and egg situation is probably to aim at local meetups which are always looking for people to give talks!

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:43.108
Another benefit of this is that you get to practice your talk and refine it before taking it to a bigger stage and audience (which is exactly what I did for my accessibility talk that I gave at iOSCon in London this year).

00:03:43.608 --> 00:03:57.354
Because I had given my talk at an Xcoders meeting two weeks before the conference, I was able to time my talk, practice it in front of people, get their questions to incorporate back into the talk, and feel like I was ready once I spoke in front of a larger crowd.

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:00.112
Step 3: Getting accepted

00:04:01.612 --> 00:04:08.485
The first year I really started getting serious about applying to conferences, my acceptance rate was 1 of 7 ¹ .

00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:15.138
Success! I attended the first CodeMobile conference in Chester, UK and talked about iMessage apps.

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:23.550
The experience of going on stage, sharing something I thought was interesting, and then getting feedback that it actually was interesting to people was great!

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.643
The attendees were all amazing and I finally got to travel outside of North America for the first time in my life.

00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:36.776
I had reached my goals and become an International™ Speaker as well as generally becoming an iOS Conference Speaker all in one go.

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:39.854
Step 4: Preparation

00:04:41.354 --> 00:04:48.946
The thing that most people don’t tell you, and the thing that you quickly find out when preparing a conference talk is how much work it is to prepare!

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:55.919
As an audience member to some great talks, I always assumed that the talk took maybe a handful of hours to prepare and format.

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.953
In practice, a talk can take something like 40–50 hours for a 45 minute session.

00:05:02.453 --> 00:05:15.720
That includes coming up with the proposal, learning about the subject (often this happens after the proposal has been accepted!), coming up with a format that will educate and inspire (and hopefully entertain) your audience, and practicing the delivery of the material.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.814
You probably also want to tailor your presentation for the audience you’re speaking to; are they mostly students?

00:05:22.314 --> 00:05:25.590
What skill level would be most appropriate to present to?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.567
What kinds of jokes might work well with your audience?

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:33.403
A good amount of the time that I put into preparing talks is practicing.

00:05:33.903 --> 00:05:40.696
It’s really up to you how polished you want the talk to be, and how comfortable you will be presenting with the amount of practice you’ve put into it.

00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:51.985
As I mentioned before, presenting early to a smaller group can really help by creating a deadline that is sooner than the actual talk and providing a method of gathering feedback to tweak your talk to make it even better.

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:59.138
One thing that’s great about having a conference talk lined up is that you can do some pretty productive stuff while procrastinating.

00:05:59.638 --> 00:06:05.631
In order to avoid preparing my iOSCon talk, I applied to speak at a conference in New York called !!

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:13.324
Con. That application ended up getting accepted, so I started down a pretty vicious cycle of speaking at more conferences!

00:06:14.324 --> 00:06:21.836
I recently came across this Twitter thread of many speakers sharing their process and how much time they put into their talks:

00:06:22.836 --> 00:06:26.591
Hey, people who talk at things: How long does it take you to put a new talk together?

00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:31.486
I need like 50 hours over at least a couple of months to make something I don't hate.

00:06:31.986 --> 00:06:37.181
I'm trying to get that down (maybe by not doing pictures?) but wondering what's normal for everyone else.

00:06:37.681 --> 00:06:41.676

00:06:42.676 --> 00:06:44.834
Step 5: Actually presenting

00:06:46.334 --> 00:06:49.770
Giving the actual talk is kind of a weird experience.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.663
After putting a ton of time into a talk upfront, I’ve found that the actual talk goes by faster than I think it will.

00:06:57.163 --> 00:07:04.036
Once I get up and start talking, I’m more or less on autopilot, and it’s almost like having an out of body experience.

00:07:04.536 --> 00:07:11.168
It might be because I put all of my brain power into giving the talk, but I can’t even really remember how I did once it’s done.

00:07:11.668 --> 00:07:20.699
Then at the end everyone claps and hopefully people ask insightful questions and no one asks a question that’s really just a statement that they’re trying to use to prove that they know something.

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.295
Once I’ve given the talk, I can actually enjoy the conference.

00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:31.708
I’ve been lucky that the first few conferences I’ve spoken at, I was the first speaker after the keynote speaker on the first day.

00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:38.681
Going earlier is also nice because then people have seen you talk and they’re usually more open about chatting with you in the hallway.

00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:40.960
Presenting some more

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:48.214
After speaking at CodeMobile in Chester, UK, I didn’t get any talks accepted for about a year.

00:07:48.714 --> 00:07:55.586
I ended up speaking again in the UK, this time in London for iOSCon in March of 2018.

00:07:56.086 --> 00:07:58.244
Then I most recently spoke at !!

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.662
Con in New York in May.

00:08:01.162 --> 00:08:06.915
I’ll be giving an updated version of my iOS accessibility talk in Boston next month for SwiftFest.

00:08:07.915 --> 00:08:11.671
This time around my acceptance rate was 3/6, which is much better.

00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:16.886
I would mostly chalk this up to the fact that I gave a talk at CodeMobile last year.

00:08:17.386 --> 00:08:25.937
I also applied to some more diverse types of tech conferences since there were fewer iOS specific ones (I think a few that I applied to didn’t actually happen).

00:08:26.937 --> 00:08:36.847
In the future, I hope I can speak again but with the three consecutive talks I’m doing in March/May/June this year, I’m ready for a little break before I get back on the conference speaking circuit.

00:08:37.347 --> 00:08:44.938
I’m really happy that I’ve been given the opportunity to share some of my experiences and the conferences I’ve been to have been really enjoyable so far.

00:08:45.938 --> 00:08:47.537
You should talk, too!

00:08:49.037 --> 00:08:55.749
When I first set my personal goal to talk at some conferences, I really wasn’t sure if I had what it would take to succeed.

00:08:56.249 --> 00:09:02.243
I don’t consider myself a great public speaker, nor would I consider myself to be an exceptional software engineer.

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:07.138
The secret is that neither is really a requirement to share cool stuff with people.

00:09:07.638 --> 00:09:13.152
You just need to have some passion for something and effectively communicate that passion by telling your story.

00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:20.785
If you’re looking for iOS conferences to apply to, there’s a well maintained list along with CFP deadlines here . Good luck!

00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:25.141
Finally, if you see me at a conference, say hi!

00:09:25.641 --> 00:09:30.276
I’m always happy to chat with people, even if I look like I’m busy or focused on other stuff.

00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:39.427
¹Actually I ended up getting another talk accepted but the conference was not interested in reimbursing me for any travel expenses so I politely declined.

00:09:39.927 --> 00:09:45.841
Given the amount of time it takes to prepare a good presentation, a conference should absolutely reimburse you for speaking.
