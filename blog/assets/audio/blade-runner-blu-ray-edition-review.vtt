Blade Runner – Blu Ray Edition Review

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:06.295
Published on June 23, 2009.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:15.446
I haven’t ever watched Blade Runner , and since I saw it on Blu-Ray at the library I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to catch up and earn some geek cred.

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:25.136
The movie seems to have all the ingredients necessary for sci-fi cult success: Harrison Ford, matte painting backgrounds, robots, Harrison Ford.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:27.554
But something kinda went wrong.

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:30.052
Spoiler alert from here on out!

00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:36.726
Blade Runner takes place in a future where androids are kind of indistinguishable from normal humans.

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:40.422
But they rebelled against us and now we want to kill them all.

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:42.680
This makes them want to kill us.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.178
Man, things get complicated quickly.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:49.673
People who hunt down androids are called “Blade Runners.”

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:52.890
Harrison Ford is a blade runner.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.546
There are some androids (actually they’re called replicants) that Harrison Ford needs to kill.

00:00:58.046 --> 00:01:00.603
This movie has a really simple plot.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:04.639
Blade Runner is apparently supposed to be really good.

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:08.895
The Blu-Ray version has like, five versions of the movie.

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:17.307
Either this means that the movie was so good that it was worthy of having five versions, or it sucked so bad that they needed to fix it multiple times!

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:19.085
I am thinking the latter.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:26.398
The issue is that Harrison Ford’s character is supposed to be a badass blade runner who retired to get out of the game.

00:01:26.898 --> 00:01:30.095
But really, he’s just lousy cop with incredible luck.

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:36.109
Blade Runner is like an exercise in how to perform Deus Ex Machina bailouts, one after another.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:44.860
Example 1: Harrison Ford (his movie name is “Decker” but let’s just call him HF) is trying to trick one of the replicants in her dressing room.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.997
She figures out he’s a cop and starts choking him.

00:01:48.497 --> 00:01:50.096
She obviously has the upper hand.

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:58.108
But then some girls walk into the dressing room so she splits and then somehow Harrison catches up to her and guns her down. Very sporting.

00:01:59.108 --> 00:02:03.822
Example 2: One of the replicants sees Harrison killing replicant 1.

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:06.320
He obviously has an advantage.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.617
He sneaks up on Harrison and starts kicking his ass.

00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:15.871
He’s also about to deliver a final blow and the other “good” replicant saves his life by shooting the bad guy in the head.

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:23.823
Example 3: Harrison lets the replicant catch him by surprise and she jumps on his head, twists it 180 degrees backwards.

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:28.399
For some reason she lets him go so she can do some kind of backflip finishing move.

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.536
She really should’ve just snapped his neck or something.

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:35.472
Harrison has a chance to get up and shoots her in mid backflip.

00:02:35.972 --> 00:02:38.369
This also seems unsportsmanlike.

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:46.082
Example 4: The replicant boss guy kind of plays around with Harrison, breaking his fingers and chasing him around.

00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:50.018
But eventually gives up since he’s (the replicant) gonna die anyway.

00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:52.755
Harrison lives to see another day.

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:56.872
So really, Decker just lucked out every single time.

00:02:57.372 --> 00:03:02.007
It makes sense; how is a human supposed to beat a super-strong replicant?

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:05.783
Decker’s only real skill is that he’s incredibly lucky.

00:03:06.283 --> 00:03:16.512
This sort of puts him in the same league as other HF characters like Han Solo (remember when he chases that stormtrooper into a room with a billion stormtroopers?) or Indiana Jones.

00:03:17.012 --> 00:03:21.647
But the movie portrays him as some kind of a Dirty Harry or Rambo-esque killing machine.

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:24.944
He’s more like Mister Magoo or Maxwell Smart.

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:28.880
But somehow I don’t think that connection was intended by the filmmaker.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.876
Besides the whole plot thing, some critics apparently had problems with the pacing.

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:40.529
I thought it was okay, except there are long stretches of Decker stuff, then long stretches of replicant team stuff.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.385
As if there were two separate plots and movies going on.

00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:51.918
I mean, it seemed like they showed two days’ worth of Decker action then two days’ worth of the other guys, but they happened around the same time span.

00:03:52.418 --> 00:03:54.575
So there’s some weirdness in continuity.

00:03:55.575 --> 00:03:59.331
The plot also seems to only lightly address the heavy plot points.

00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:05.185
For example, the moral implications of giving life to these replicants and then limiting their lifespan.

00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:09.042
That’s in addition to basically making them illegal and then killing them.

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:14.416
Instead the movie tends to antagonize them even though they’re really the victims in this story.

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:19.311
It turns into a simple cat and mouse hunt rather than anything particularly meaningful.

00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:24.467
One thing the filmmaker got right: The future sure has a lot of Asians in it!

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:30.880
Japanese, Chinese, etc. I sure am glad we’re represented (though also sort of tokenized) in the future!

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.917
I really have no idea why this movie is considered a classic.

00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:36.855
Maybe I’m being too hard on it.

00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:40.392
It was, after all, released in ‘82, before I was born.

00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:44.648
But plenty of sci-fi movies made before then stand the test of time.

00:04:45.148 --> 00:04:48.504
I feel as though Blade Runner is just a bit overrated.

00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:56.276
Just to give Philip K. Dick a chance, I grabbed “ Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? ” from the library.

00:04:56.776 --> 00:04:59.972
I think it may end up being a more thoughtful exercise.
