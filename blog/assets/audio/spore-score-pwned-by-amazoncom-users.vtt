Spore Score Pwned By Amazon.com Users

I really love how users on Amazon have rebelled and made the average score of Spore = 1.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.960
I’m not sure if the game is really that bad or not, but it seems the big beef so far is with the DRM scheme.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.340
If that’s so, I kind of feel bad for the developers.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.800
They probably have no say in whether or not their game gets DRM slapped on it, so it’s punishing them for something out of their control.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.960
DRM sucks, but I dunno if it’s “okay” to act like a baby and give the game 1 star if it’s really better than that.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.060
But hey, I haven’t played it so maybe it really sucks.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.360
Probably has to do with the years(!) of hype the game got that couldn’t possibly be followed through in the end.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.160
In other video game news, I got Disgaea 3 and have been playing that for a bit.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.340
It’s pretty much the same as Disgaea 1-2 but it’s still fun.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.400
I’m a bit dissapointed that the vector graphics are still pretty low res.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.500
If it’s the PS3 I’d like to see at least a few more pixels on those characters.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.160
3D would probably ruin the game, but higher res would be very much appreciated.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.160
I also got Resident Evil 4 for the Wii but haven’t played it yet.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.220
Too scared of dogs jumping through the window like in the first one… Fuck that was scary!
