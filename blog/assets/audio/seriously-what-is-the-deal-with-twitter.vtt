Seriously, What Is The Deal With Twitter!?

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.700
Published on May 06, 2007.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.420
So I’ve been reading about this thing called Twitter on some web 2.0 sites and whatnot.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.760
Call me pessimistic but it sounds like a completely useless idea.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.620
Now, before I had heard about twitter, I had used this thing called “status updates” on Facebook.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.120
I guess they’re pretty similar.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.800
On Twitter and Facebook, you can write updates on what you’re doing, either from your phone or your computer.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.300
I think the difference is that Twitter sends updates to your friends on what you’re doing by SMS or whatever.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.000
Facebook just sorta posts your status on the site.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.720
Now, I actually use the Facebook updates now and then, but it seems like people who use Twitter do this to the max.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.460
Like they update multiple times a day.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.200
Are these people so self-centered that they think everyone needs to know what they’re doing?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.040
I think the difference between this functionality in Facebook and in Twitter is this: In Facebook, it’s just that.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.660
A functionality. In Twitter, the ability to update is the entire application itself.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.320
To me, Twitter is simply a subset of what Facebook already provides.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.660
Why would you ever need both?

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.740
The only thing I can see that Twitter does better is leaving out the required “is” that facebook stick in the updates.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.640
So I can write “Hung Truong likes cheese” rather than “Hung Truong is liking cheese.” Screw gerunds!

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.360
Regardless, Twitter seems to be insanely popular.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.500
At least with web 2.0 blogs.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.240
For now I’ll stick to updating with Facebook, like every few days or so…
