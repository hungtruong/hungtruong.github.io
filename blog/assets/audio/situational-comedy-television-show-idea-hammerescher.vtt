00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.620
Published on October 29, 2008.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.860
Idea: MC Hammer has a nearly fatal brain injury, caused by a falling hammer (irony).

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.400
It turns out that half of his brain has been permanently damaged.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.780
The only choice is a semi-brain transplant.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.480
The only available brain belongs to MC Escher.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.540
It has been cryogenially preserved since his death in 1972.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.480
The operation is a major success; MC Hammer has now become MC Hammer/Escher.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.340
The world ushers in a new era of really confusing rap.
