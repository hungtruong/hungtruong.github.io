Dream: Door to Door Pig Salesman

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.860
Published on February 18, 2007.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.940
So I had this totally weird dream last night.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.360
It involved my entire neighborhood!

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.620
For some reason, there was someone going door to door leaving pigs at people’s houses.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.160
When the guy got to our house, we didn’t answer the door.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.980
He opened our outer shutter door and left a pig in between the two doors.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.320
I could see all of this happening through our peep hole, even though It’d be pretty impossible to see that low in real life.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.500
Weird. Okay, now that I think of it, I guess he was more of a pig mailman than a salesman, but I have a feeling we were billed for the pig.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
To be payed for at a later date.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.920
Anyway, when I opened the door, the pig ran in and I guess we kept it as a pet.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.820
I went to my neighbor’s house and found that the pig guy had left a pig in her door as well.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.680
When I opened it though, it was like some kind of mutant weird pig and I ran away.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.640
Later, I went to my across the street neighbor’s house.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.460
We had seen him with his pig earlier, so I guess we decided to check up on it.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.640
When we got there, he adamantly denied having any kind of pig.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.860
We knew he was lying because we saw him playing with the pig though his window from our house.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.300
Then the dream ended.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.720
It totally made no sense to me, but that’s how a lot of my dreams go.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:36.900
It’s probably worth noting that today is Chinese New Year, and yes, it’s the year of the pig!!! Maybe that somehow subconsciously seeped into my brain while I was dreaming last night… Also, my Chinese zodiac sign is the pig!!! Dun dun dunnnn!!!
