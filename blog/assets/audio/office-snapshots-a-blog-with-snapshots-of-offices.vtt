Office Snapshots: A Blog With Snapshots… of Offices…

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.540
Published on January 30, 2008.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.180
While looking at places to intern during the Summer, I came across this blog called Office Snapshots .

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.080
You would think a blog that had nothing but pictures of tech company offices wouldn’t work, but oh, how it does!

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.520
The author gets pictures of offices through Flickr, or sometimes by actually visiting the offices himself.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.180
Then there’s a funny weird writeup about the company and their office.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.040
The blogger doesn’t take himself too seriously with quotes like this:

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.320
McAfee has been keeping our computers safe from spam, viruses, spyware, phishing, and the like since the 80s.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.820
They’re like the sheriffs of the web.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.840
Except they have less shoot-outs and more Internet (a lot more).

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.440
Overall, it’s a good read.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.660
There’s something really enjoyable at seeing how cool other people’s offices are versus your own.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.680
I mean, my office doesn’t even have windows, though I do get my own burgundy line of office equipment.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.100
Maybe I should send pictures to Office Snapshots to see if they’ll get posted…
