They Might Be Giants Podcast 27A: John Henry Demos!

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.980
Published on July 13, 2007.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.860
They Might Be Giants used to be my favorite band.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.800
I say “used to be” because their last few albums have kind of sucked.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.980
I mean, there’s still some good songs coming out, but I think they’ve jumped the shark (seriously, a kid’s album !?).

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:30.000
Anyway, I subscribed to the TMBG Podcast since it’s free, and they occasionally play some rare stuff from their old glory days.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.400
I just listened to their podcast 27A today, which has a crapload of demo versions of songs from John Henry.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:49.980
The songs are: Dirt Bike, No One Knows My Plan, I Should Be Allowed To Think, No One Knows My Plan, Out of Jail, Lullaby of Nightmares (which I think appeared on Long Tall Weekend), and A Self Called Nowhere.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.560
Unfortunately, nowhere does End of the Tour or Destination Moon show up.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.980
I guess they can’t put the whole album up…

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.660
The first real TMBG album I ever heard was John Henry .

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.440
Or maybe it was Flood , but I liked John Henry more.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.180
I’m probably the only person who actually likes John Henry (it’s criticized a lot!).

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.120
So it’s very cool to hear demo version of the songs that I’m really familiar with.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.340
It seems like the horn players haven’t really gotten their inflections into the songs yet, and the Johns also sing a bit more reserved.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.900
If you’re one of the few TMBG fans that actually likes John Henry, I suggest you go grab the podcast and give it a listen.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.760
Incidentally, I’ve heard that their new album is good, but that might be only compared to the last two albums ( Mink Car and The Spine ) which were passable at best.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.740
I really do hope it’s good, but I’m not really in any rush to be disappointed.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.820
For now, I still pledge my Nerd Rock allegiance to Jonathan Coulton .
