This Puzzle Alarm Clock shoots out a simple 4 piece jigsaw puzzle when it’s time for you to wake up.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.320
The alarm clock won’t turn off until you put the pieces back together correctly.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.020
I guess the idea is that putting the puzzle back together stimulates your brain enough so that it wakes up.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.120
Seems like a pretty cool idea.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.500
But what happens when a piece flies under the bed?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.280
It’d be hammer time for the clock, methinks.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.640
The Puzzle Alarm Clock can be yours for only $52!

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.620
Hmmm, for that price I’d rather buy a few Neverlates , synchronize them, and stick them in various places in my room.
