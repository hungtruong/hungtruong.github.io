Google Street View Easter Egg!

Google just released a new feature in Google Maps that lets you see a 3d view of streets in a few select locations.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.280
One of these locations is in Silicon Valley, so I figured I’d check out Google Headquarters (it’s a lot easier than stalking them in person).

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.260
I remembered from my visit that the Googleplex was on Ampitheatre Parkway, so I just went there and looked at the street view.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.900
While circling the Googleplex (in a non-threatening manner), I found an easter egg!

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.800
There’s a bunch of googlers in green shirts, with one riding a motorcycle !

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.700
Neat! I’m guessing they were on the team that did the mapping or had something to do with the street level feature.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:56.020
By the way, the street level views are freaking sweet!!! There’s incredible detail (you can zoom in) and every few feet there’s a 3d panorama to view.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.280
Incredible. If they could get this for every city, I really think sightseeing in person would become obsolete.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.960
PS, I still want to work at Google very, very badly.
