John Hodgman Book Signing at Ann Arbor Borders: #1165

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.620
Published on October 27, 2008.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.940
John Hodgman is a pretty funny dude.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.480
I’ve previously listened to his book on audio and also borrowed it from the library to read the charts (much funnier in chart form).

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.020
So when I heard he’d be making an appearance in Ann Arbor at Borders #1, I was really stoked.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.860
I got there on time at around 7:00pm, but apparently John wanted to teach us a lesson in punctuality?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.880
Actually, someone should teach John a lesson in “Michigan Time,” being 10 minutes late for everything.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:46.540
As I got there, he was saying some random funny stuff about the guy who directed Hancock having two (!) copies of Frank Herbert’s Dune in his bag in an airplane.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.640
Wow. Then some Q&A about voting machines and mole men.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.980
And he read some words.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.800
Out of the very book I was to purchase!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.200
A line formed for signing, and I kinda got there at the end because I thought I needed to grab a book for him to actually sign.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.500
I must’ve waited maybe an hour or two?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.680
Probably closer to two.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.980
When my moment came, I made sure to point out to John that I had corrected his spelling of Albuquerque , only to have him burn me by spelling it even more incorrectly .

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.160
Then he wrote “Sorry about New Mexicoe” in my book.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.620
What a bastard!

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.320
Just kidding. Apparently John counts the number of books he’s signed.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.500
He yelled the number of the next person in line to prompt them to approach. I’m #1165.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.020
I should also add that Hodgman was really nice.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.240
Very polite and receptive, even to crazed fans.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.540
I guess minor celebrity hasn’t gotten to his head yet.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.160
Except for the random ALL CAPS words he throws into his writing.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.020
THAT IS ALL.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.980
Oh, and about the picture, I dunno what happened.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.840
Maybe Hodgman is shrinking or I am entirely tall, or maybe he was just leaning over a bunch?

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.660
It’s totally going to be my Christmas card!
