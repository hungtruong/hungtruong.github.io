Ingrid Michaelson: Be OK

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.060
Published on October 15, 2008.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.380
Ingrid Michaelson just released a new cd: Be OK.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.440
This one’s sort of a single-ish one since a lot of the material is either from previous stuff or live recordings.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.620
There’s 11 tracks but three are live, and there’s some duplication (live vs. studio, and acoustic).

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.680
So I’d say there’s more than a single’s worth of stuff but not quite an album’s worth.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.080
Ingrid continues to do cool stuff with her awesome voice and funky phrasing.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.860
It’s pretty unique.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.240
Her actual songwriting seems a bit amateurish or at least good but not super great.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.380
I guess her style is lots of repetition, which doesn’t work when applied to every song.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.200
It’s like the “Green Eggs and Ham” of music.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420
But that’s her style so that’s cool I guess.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.620
I also noticed that her style seems to be using more vibrato and running around with her voice.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880
I’m not too impressed by it.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.100
It’s especially noticeable on “Over The Rainbow.”

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.480
She can do cooler stuff with her voice than that, I think.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.440
Finally, I’m kind of disappointed that she’s not wearing glasses on the cover!!! As a glasses-girl lover I am appalled.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.260
Well, not really.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.600
But I went ahead and threw the album cover into that “virtual try on glasses” thing I used to pick my own glasses:

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.640
Much better!

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.960
Anyway, there’s some cool songs on here.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.940
Plus the proceeds of the CD go to standup2cancer.org which is nice.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.880
My favorite song is probably “Giving Up” (which doesn’t sound like it should be on a cancer fighting CD, but whatever).

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.400
Also, I am pretty bummed that the tickets for the Ingrid Michaelson concert in Ann Arbor are already sold out!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.700
I guess she has a pretty solid fanbase here.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.600
Maybe she should book in Detroit or something.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.100
*Hint hint*. I already saw her last year but it’d be cool to see her again, especially before she gets uber famous (which should happen pretty soon).
