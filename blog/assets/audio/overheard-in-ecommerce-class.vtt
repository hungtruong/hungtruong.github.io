Overheard in eCommerce Class…

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.100
Published on March 24, 2008.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.300
Professor: So the Amazon.com auction is different.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.760
If an auction receives a bid within the last 10 minutes, the auction is extended for 10 minutes.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.900
So the auction ends when it is quiescent.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.980
Student: How do you spell that?

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.180
Me: *Facepalm*
