Less than 4 hours after writing about The Dark Knight, revenge struck in the form of a bat flying around in my apartment.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.080
I’m not sure if this bat was sent as punishment for me not going to see Dark Knight again or what, but it freaked me out!

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.660
It flew around the living room for a while, terrorizing me, then went to other parts of the apartment.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.320
Then it kinda crawled around on the ground for a while.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.740
I think it was trying to hide or look for high ground to start flying again.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.100
Then I hatched an ingenious plan to open a window and have the bat fly out of it! It worked!

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.580
I really have no idea how the bat got in, since the only windows open were the ones with screens.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.560
Maybe the bat squeezed through one?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.860
Or maybe it was a lame assassination attempt?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.040
We may never know the truth!
