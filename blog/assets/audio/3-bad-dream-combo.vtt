3 (Bad) Dream Combo!

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.534
Published on January 19, 2009.

00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:10.011
So last night I had three dreams.

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:11.790
They were all kinda bad.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.966
I think they went from worst to least worst, which is good, I suppose.

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.044
The first one was pretty simple.

00:00:19.544 --> 00:00:22.181
I was dreaming that I was half-asleep.

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.797
Maybe I really was half-asleep and just hallucinating.

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:27.895
I’m not entirely sure.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:32.311
Anyway, I dreamed that I was sleeping in my parent’s bed.

00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:34.329
In-between both of them.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.948
Kinda funny huh?

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:37.886
That’s not what made it bad.

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:41.263
I also dreamed there was something flying around the room.

00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:45.199
It was kind of hard to tell what, but I sensed it was leathery.

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:46.738
Like, say, a bat .

00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:53.412
Then, as I realized the flying object really was a bat, it decided to fly onto my neck and bite it!

00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:56.788
You know how in dreams you sort of do things in slow-motion?

00:00:57.288 --> 00:01:02.003
So sometimes you know something is inevitable, but you still try to stop it anyway?

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:04.261
This was how the bite felt.

00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:11.394
As the bat bit me (I swear I felt pain), I woke up like in the movies where someone wakes up from a bad dream.

00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:14.851
I literally checked my neck to see if a bat was biting me.

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:17.828
And to see if my parents were in my bed.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:20.725
Luckily neither of these things happened.

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:23.483
I went back to sleep.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.061
Then I had another dream.

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:30.716
This time, I was watching TV, waiting to leave to the airport.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:38.409
As I was watching some sitcom (unfortunately I can’t remember which), my dad told me, “hey, aren’t you late for your flight?”

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.224
I didn’t realize that it was 3:15 AM, and my flight left at 3:30 AM!

00:01:43.724 --> 00:01:50.916
I hurried to the airport, picked up my ticket (which looked like a receipt) from a drive-up booth (apparently this was faster) and went into the airport.

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:55.412
Somehow, I went a special way that I didn’t have to go through security!

00:01:55.912 --> 00:02:01.585
I sorta pretended to get into line from the end, just to make sure no one accused me of jumping the security.

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:06.321
Then I think my flight must’ve left, because I was just sitting in the airport.

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.277
I noticed that someone left a bag lying around.

00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:12.455
I thought it might be a bomb!

00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:17.430
But it turns out it was just a bunch of metal tools that the guy wasn’t allowed to take, I guess.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.885
Now that I think of it, I wonder why they would’ve been allowed into the “sterile” area.

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:28.180
Anyway, I took the tools and for some reason there was some kind of pawn shop in the airport.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.716
I sold the tools for $8 and some change!

00:02:32.216 --> 00:02:34.374
I think it might’ve been $8.11.

00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:35.673
I’m not sure.

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:40.588
The third dream I had was where I was in some kind of RPG video game.

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:43.885
I was semi-in the game and semi-playing the game.

00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:48.461
At one point I stepped outside of a dungeon, then went back inside.

00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:51.358
Then I fought a battle in which I lost.

00:02:51.858 --> 00:02:54.735
AND I REALIZED I DIDN’T SAVE THE GAME!

00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:58.431
But then apparently I had saved it when I stepped out of the dungeon.

00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:03.886
So I guess this wasn’t actually a bad dream, just a potentially bad situation that never happened…
