Wii Fit: Fun With Linear Regression!

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.100
Published on July 13, 2008.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.180
So I’ve been playing Wii Fit for a while.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.960
One of the really neat things about the program (it’s not really a game, right?) is that it automagically graphs your progress as you lose weight.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.900
It’s pretty nice getting positive feedback when you put hard work into something.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.000
I think this is one of the very well thought-out features of Wii Fit.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.760
Anyway, I was looking at my weight going down and figured I’d do some rudimentary linear regression on it.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.820
I’m pretty much just eyeballing it because I don’t want to throw stuff into R or Matlab.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.200
It seems as though I’ll reach a threshold (away from Obesity) around the end of August.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.500
Though I’m basing this on a linear fit.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.400
It’s possible that the actual plot will end up looking more like a power law since it’s easier to lose weight when you’re way overweight.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.460
The point is, I’m losing weight and it’s nice to try and see when I might reach my goals.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.380
I also think it’s worth noting that Wii Fit seems to overestimate my weight.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.800
Because when I use my bathroom scale my weight is always lower than what Wii Fit says.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.540
I guess I could adjust the “weight of clothing” but since I always pick the same thing I don’t want to mess with the consistency.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.860
Now, if Nintendo had programmed some regression in automatically, I’d have to give it a 10/10 for science!

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.400
But for now I’m pretty happy with just the graph functionality.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.140
It’s fun seeing large local fluctuations with a general downward trend.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.840
Now, if I can only keep this graph from turning into a parabola like with my DDR Diet…
