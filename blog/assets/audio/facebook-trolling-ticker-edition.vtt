I sort of have a tradition when it comes to Facebook updates.

00:00:10.352 --> 00:00:17.704
When Facebook introduced polls, I took advantage of the viral sharing properties to expand my poll to more than my close circle of friends .

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:24.357
The Facebook ticker feature just rolled out this week, and yesterday Spotify integrated with Facebook’s new graph api.

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:29.592
I’ve noticed a whole lot of ticker updates since then from my friends’ playlists.

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:36.485
I decided I would have some fun with the Ticker feature, so I went on Spotify and made a playlist of just “Never Gonna Give You Up.”

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:42.499
At first I thought it had not worked, but it looks like my friends are now all aware of my favorite song in the world.

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:48.454
I mostly mess with Facebook to point out unintended consequences of their design decisions.

00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:56.466
In this case, something passive like listening to music overpowers stuff that might actually be interesting, like a comment or a post.

00:00:56.966 --> 00:01:06.076
I wonder if Facebook will change their ticker behavior, or continue to allow it to be used for a “firehose” of info while the news feed will be used for more interesting/important stuff.
