Thoughts and Predictions on Apple’s iAd Platform

00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:07.333
Published on July 02, 2010.

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:15.925
After reading this article on the upcoming iAd release , I have a few thoughts on the future of Apple’s mobile advertising platform.

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:23.398
iAds on Apple devices will be rich media experiences, they’ll stay in the app, and they’ll make developers tons of money.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.136
That’s what Apple assumes, at least.

00:00:26.636 --> 00:00:34.308
The major takeaways from this article are that only a limited number of advertisers are signing on at first, and at a really high premium.

00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:39.363
What’s more, iAds are costly to “develop” which will limit the number of advertisers at first.

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:47.795
Advertising relies on a steady supply of supply (advertising inventory) and demand (ad impressions).

00:00:48.295 --> 00:00:54.288
The advertisers supply the… well, supply, and the developers handle the demand by providing users who will see the ads.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:01:03.819
Because there’s not much supply yet, and because I have a feeling many developers will integrate iAds into their apps or already have, I predict a few things happening:

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.335
Users will go through a high degree of ad fatigue.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:14.588
With only a few different ads available, users will probably get bored of the same ads over and over.

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:22.600
Sure, they’re rich and interactive, but if I see that same Toy Story 3 ad a billion times, it won’t be effective anymore.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.817
This will probably contribute to iAd blindness.

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:29.854
Initial advertisers will pay a premium for being first.

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:37.226
Because of the limited inventory and abundant number of impressions, advertisers will probably end up using up a lot of their inventory.

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:44.519
Apple might have a way of throttling ad impressions so they remain constant throughout a time period (or at least they should).

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:47.976
If so, iAd display will be pretty erratic.

00:01:48.476 --> 00:01:50.873
Sometimes they’ll show and sometimes they won’t.

00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:55.608
Of course, if that happens, publishers will be upset that their placements aren’t selling.

00:01:56.608 --> 00:02:01.003
Publishers (developers) will make some money, but not as much as they thought (at first).

00:02:01.503 --> 00:02:03.661
Or at least, not until the ad inventory goes up.

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:12.152
Because Apple will probably throttle the advertisements going to them, or users will be weary of the same ads showing up, publishers will suffer at first.

00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:17.767
In the long run, publishers will probably end up making more when the supply and demand issues fix themselves.

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:23.162
Advertisements will probably start off being innovative, then fall in quality.

00:02:23.662 --> 00:02:26.459
I have a feeling they will mirror the app store apps.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.710
There will be many high quality ads at first, but once Apple requires a steady amount of rich ads, others will develop iAds for advertisers.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.124
The ad inventory quality will suffer because of the cost and time associated with creating high quality ads.

00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:50.515
On a high level, I see a few early issues in the iAd platform, mostly the demand for ads outweighing the amount of initial advertisements.

00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:56.129
Over time, this will correct itself, but at the cost of the quality of ads delivered.

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.945
Think of how the App Store degenerated into crappy mirror apps, etc.

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:07.438
Apple would like to keep the quality of their ads high, but I can’t see this happening based on the number of ads they need to deliver.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:13.473
This will happen because Apple is offering the iAd platform to all publishers (developers).

00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:19.007
If they had hand-picked a few to beta test, I have a feeling the supply and demand would match up.

00:03:19.507 --> 00:03:25.181
Apple knows they’re behind in the game though, so that’s probably why they’re releasing it to all developers.

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:30.795
In the long run, I think the iAd platform will be a hit for advertisers and developers.

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:36.090
Hopefully the level of ad quality doesn’t suffer so much that it affects the end user too much.
