Final Fantasy XII Potion Commercial!

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.500
Published on March 04, 2006.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.380
A new commercial for the Final Fantasy Potion I wrote about has been put online.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.880
It’s a typical love story.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.340
A guy wants the last Final Fantasy Potion, he sees a girl, their eyes lock.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.360
Guy casts Blizzaga on girl, y’know how it goes… While this commercial is totally awesome, it still hasn’t convinced me to spend $12.50 on a bottle yet.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.120
Check out the commercial here .
