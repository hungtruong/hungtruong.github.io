A Visit To The Tokyo Hardcore Pop Culture Shoppe

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.140
A few days ago I had some lunch with a colleague of mine in Albuquerque at El Patio.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:23.720
It was pretty good except for the fact that I ordered a blue corn spinach enchilada and I got a normal enchilada, but I only realized it after I ate about 90% of it because I was hungry for green chile.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.400
Anyway, after the lunch we went to scope out the area.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.260
The “Brick Light District,” as it’s called, is fairly new.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.920
It wasn’t there when I went to UNM.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.540
I saw this store that had a sign: “ Tokyo Hardcore Pop Culture Shoppe .”

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.480
We went in.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.440
The first thing I noticed was a Domo-kun plushie.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.860
Pretty cool. Then I noticed some other random Japanese culture stuff.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.360
Hello Kitty stuff, birthday candles that spelled out “omedetou,” vinyl toys, etc.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.140
It kind of reminded me of Wizzywig , except with less emphasis on video game and anime pop culture and more on fashion and toy culture.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.340
I talked to the store clerk girl for a little bit about the store.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.600
Apparently there are less people that come in who are “our age” and more really young people and fairly old people.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.660
Interesting. She said they opened maybe a few months ago and that they’re getting cool new items in regularly.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.860
I’m pretty happy that a store like this exists in my (former) town.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.880
I think it adds a lot to the vibe that Albuquerque is one of those culturally interesting cities.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.300
I think I read somewhere that we’re somewhere up there with Austin and Seattle, etc.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.880
So I hope the store does well.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.380
Also, the girl at the counter was really cute, in that Suicide Girls kind of way.
