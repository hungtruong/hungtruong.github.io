Found Audio #01: Working Undercover For the Man

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.074
Here’s the first installment of my Found Audio series of “podcasts.”

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:36.326
The start of my tape (at least, one side of it) featured a recorded session of Dial-a-song, They Might Be Giants’ phone song service.

00:00:36.826 --> 00:00:39.223
You call the number and they play you a song.

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:43.159
Back when I recorded this, long distance phone calls were not free.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:50.692
Unless, of course, you used Dialpad , the PC to Phone service that worked over 56kbps connections circa 2000!

00:00:51.192 --> 00:01:01.181
Due to the transmission of the song from NY to phone to internet to my speakers to my portable tape recorder to my Macbook Pro, the sound quality is not the best.

00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:06.017
This was a pretty popular dial-a-song, but not their best.

00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:11.232
I think I had recorded another one, possibly “Hovering Sombrero.”
