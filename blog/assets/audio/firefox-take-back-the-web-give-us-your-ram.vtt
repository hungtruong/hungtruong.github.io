Seriously, I like Firefox and all, but it’s a total RAMaholic!

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.160
For your information, I’m browing with one window, five tabs.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.580
It’s been on for a while, sure, but 375MB!?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.620
Maybe this is fixed in the new cool 2.0 alpha release… Should I install it?
