Yep, it’s time for another edition of “Jazz Song Currently Stuck In My Head.”

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.080
This time, it’s “You’d Be So Nice To Come Home To.”

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.060
I heard it on Together, with Chet Baker and Paul Desmond, a couple of times before.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.520
For some reason, though, it’s become stuck in my head now.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.640
What I really like about the tune is the chord progression.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.380
It sorta goes from minor to a major section, back to minor, so you can do a lot of stuff with the improvisation.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.560
At least, I think so.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.140
My theory’s not as good as it used to be…

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.300
Anyway, here’s the lyrics:

00:00:45.300 --> 00:01:00.260
You’d be so nice to come to You’d be so nice by the fire While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby You’d be all that I could desire Under stars chilled by the winter Under an August moon burning above You’d be so nice You’d be paradise, to come home to and love

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.540
There seems to be a lot of people in Japan who like this song.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.480
Perhaps because Chet Baker played it live there once upon a time?
