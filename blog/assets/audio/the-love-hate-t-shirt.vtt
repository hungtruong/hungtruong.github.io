Via Boingboing , this shirt appears to have the word “hate” written on it, but when you see the mirror image, it looks like “love” instead!

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:22.120
This shirt probably isn’t for sale anywhere, but I have a feeling that the design will soon be ganked and put on threadless.com /other places.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.880
Personally, I think it would be cooler if “love” was the default word on the shirt.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.420
Who goes walking around wearing a “hate” shirt anyway?

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.600
It should be easy.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.380
Just flip the image !
