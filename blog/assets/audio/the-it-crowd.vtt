The IT Crowd

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.900
Published on February 07, 2006.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.540
So I downloaded this show called “The IT Crowd.”

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.640
It’s some kind of British sitcom based on two guys and a girl in the IT department of a big company.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:24.060
In case you don’t know, “IT” stands for “Information Technology” and basically means the department that fixes all the computer problems and controls the technology of a company.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.680
Yes, this show is geared towards nerds.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.680
The two guys are computer nerds, and the new girl knows nothing about computers.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.620
Blatant stereotypes aside, this show is very smart.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:45.360
The mise-en-scene in the basement has random computer parts everywhere, and geeks in the know will recognise the EFF stickers posted on pretty much everything.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.680
The great part about this show is that on top of being funny, it’s also super random.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.660
I guess the British have a better appreciation for random crazy humor than Americans.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.920
My only major gripe has to do with the addition of a laugh track.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.660
I don’t need people telling me when to laugh!

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.500
It seems to have a very limited target audience, but hopefully this show will keep going for a long long time.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.580
