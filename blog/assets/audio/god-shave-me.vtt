God, shave me!

Published on November 28, 2005.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:14.886
I had this dream that I was shaving, with my electric shaver as always, and about halfway through the shave, the battery ran out!

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:22.978
It was really stressful, because for some reason I was in a hurry (class or something), and now I would be late + only half my face would be shaven!

00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:26.035
I didn’t really think to plug the shaver in.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:35.246
Anyway, when I woke up this morning I made sure to charge my Norelco beard trimmer 7200 so something terrible like that doesn’t really happen.

00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:43.658
I was curious as to what me dream meant (beside being a ghost of November 28 future), so I looked up shaving on dreemmoods.com.

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:45.916
So apparently it means that:

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:50.432
To dream that you are shaving, suggests that you are making a minor

00:00:50.932 --> 00:00:54.848
life-changing decision. Some aspect of your daily routine is being

00:00:55.348 --> 00:01:00.302
altered. Alternatively, it may represent your severe attitude or self- punishment.

00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:06.496
Of course, it could just mean that I didn’t shave all Thanksgiving weekend, and that I need a shave right now!
