There are a few memes that are pretty regularly printed on Threadless.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:21.060
Stuff like pop culture references turned into puns , things with cute faces (which normally don’t have faces) and birds are among the popular subjects of Threadless shirts.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:30.191
I just noticed another one while browsing the site for shirts during the summer $12 sale (which has been extended to Friday): pianos that aren’t.

00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:34.228
Item 1: The Choir of Antarctica

00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:37.705
Item 2: Piano Skyline

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.342
Item 3: The Pianist

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:43.780
Are there any that I missed?

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.198
Lemme know in the comments!
