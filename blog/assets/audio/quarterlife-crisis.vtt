Quarterlife Crisis!

00:00:02.858 --> 00:00:05.655
Published on June 08, 2009.

00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:08.973
Today, I turn 26.

00:00:09.473 --> 00:00:12.190
I think I can officially have a “quarterlife crisis.”

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.441
Yes, I know that’s pretty generous, assuming I’ll live to 104, but hey, with science and technology, maybe life expectancies will shoot up…

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.836
Though I used the term previously, I recently read about it at Krunk4Ever .

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:31.291
That led me to an article about the phenomenon , which led me to a book on the subject .

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:39.703
I checked the book out from the library (Shapiro Undergraduate, AKA the UGLi) and figured it’d be an interesting read.

00:00:40.703 --> 00:00:47.735
Basically, the phenomenon is that people these days are on a fixed track for much of their lives, up til around their twenties.

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:53.429
They go to grade school, do well in that, go to college, do well, and maybe go to grad school.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.605
After getting a terminal degree, they actually have choices to make.

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:01.541
They need to decide what they’ll do for the rest of their lives.

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.119
This can seem daunting, apparently.

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.254
I suppose I myself feel that way, though mostly I think it’s empowering and exciting.

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:12.971
The article I read was concise and informative.

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:18.186
The book is a bit too long, too colloquial and seems to talk down to the reader a bunch.

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:28.275
There’s also lots of random references, like a testimonial that uses Back to the Future to drive home the point about rejection (Marty’s dad is a wuss).

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:35.248
Basically, the book is composed of a bunch of examples of people who had quarterlife crises and what they did to get out of them.

00:01:35.748 --> 00:01:42.781
Here’s one of my favorite excerpts (of the amount I read (I only got about halfway through the book before deciding it’s a waste of my reading time)):

00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:58.726
… I realized that I don’t want to make marriage my goal, because I’m afraid that if marriage is a goal for me, then I’ll settle for some less-than-perfect man when I hit 30 just because the time is right… I have a backup plan: if I’m not married by 30, I’ll buy a cat (I already have two).

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:02.822
And then if I’m still single at 35, I’ll buy another cat.

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:12.113
And then, if I’m still single at 40, I’ll buy another cat, which means my goal in life is this: at the age of 40, I’ll either be married or have five cats.

00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:18.627
I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess that Sandra has an ALA-accredited degree … Librarian!

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:27.299
Maybe one thing that just annoys me about the book is it’s full of whiny twentysomethings complaining about their lives that aren’t really that bad.

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.595
Everyone wants a job that’s fulfilling and interesting.

00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:34.771
But those don’t come easily; if they did, everyone would have them.

00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:42.703
The book claims the profiles are from multiple ethnicities and regions of the US, but it reads like Stuff White People Like .

00:02:43.203 --> 00:02:46.719
This is kind of amazing because the book came out years before the blog.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.356
I guess my own experience has been a bit different.

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:55.971
For a while I didn’t know what I’d end up doing, but I was pretty confident I’d be okay in the end.

00:02:56.471 --> 00:03:00.626
I just realize that as bad as things might seem, they could definitely be worse.

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:11.355
I’ve also been extremely lucky, getting into a great graduate school program, securing a job before graduation, etc, so maybe I have enough direction that this crisis doesn’t apply.

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:16.831
I’ve had a few life experiences that have shown me that living life to the fullest is really important.

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:20.767
There isn’t really time to doubt yourself and get into a slump.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:24.943
After all, the quarterlife crisis assumes you will live to 100.

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:27.920
It assumes that you will have much more life ahead of you.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.655
While that may be true, I’ve seen firsthand that life can be cut very short.

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:37.550
I think the trick is living with intention and enjoying life howevér you can.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.527
Roll with the punches; play it by ear.

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:46.302
This doesn’t mean to forgo planning, but don’t sacrifice too much for the distant (unpredictable) future.

00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:50.078
It sounds cliché, but really, I think it’s a good motto to have.

00:03:51.078 --> 00:03:54.434
Some people are not even lucky enough to reach their quarterlife crisis.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.811
That seems to make the “crisis” seem a bit more manageable.

00:03:58.311 --> 00:04:06.462
While this is a pretty far-out comparison (being unsure of your life is better than being dead), I think it helps to put the thing into perspective.

00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:11.198
