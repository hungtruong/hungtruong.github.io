I’ve been playing Pokemon Pearl for a while now, and I still haven’t found my favorite pokemon, Snorlax.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.480
He’s totally awesome since he’s huge!

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.540
I remember giving him Ice Beam (I think) back in the original Pokemon game and he literally owned everyone, ever.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.220
This video I found confirms my belief that Snorlax owns.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.240
And he owns hard.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.700
Just check out the play by play commentary of Snorlax helping like, everybody!

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.140
PS This is totally NSFW due to multiple F-bombs proclaiming the awesomeness that is Snorlax.
