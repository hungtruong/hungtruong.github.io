00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.460
Whoa, Tetris DS is out!

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.240
How’d I miss that one!?

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.380
I should really get it, considering it got like, super awesome scores from everyone in the world.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.640
Unlike Tetris Worlds.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.560
This one has a bunch of new modes, and apparently they’re good.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.660
I’m up for some Tetris action, so I think I’ll be getting this game shortly (and playing it longly (ha!)).

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.760
In other news, nested parentheses are kind of bad in writing (but okay in scheme (and ML)).

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.280
I need a good “staple” game for my Nintendo DS that just stays in the system forever while I keep playing it.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.340
Tetris always hung out in my original Game Boy, so it seems like a good idea for Tetris DS to hang out in my DS.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.080
Although I wish they’d treat it like a retro version and sell it for $20 or something.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.540
That would be awesome.
