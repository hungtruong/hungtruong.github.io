Wii Fit Anomalies! (Easter Eggs?)

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.540
Published on July 01, 2008.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.220
So I’ve been playing Wii Fit for a while, and I’ve noticed some weird stuff happen.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:22.440
For example, some days I’ll just get the male trainer (I typically like the female trainer) and he’ll say something like “Hey there, I’ll be your trainer for today” but he goes away after one exercise.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:31.100
Also, my normal trainer will just say random stuff sometimes, like she’ll act sleepy and talk about how she didn’t get enough sleep last night.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.560
Hey trainer, let’s try to keep it professional, huh?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.980
I don’t want to know about your personal life.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.100
Another random thing I noticed was that my playing time would just randomly reset sometimes.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.000
I finally figured out what was going on last night.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.500
It turns out that Wii Fit just counts the minutes you work out per day.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.040
So since I was playing late last night, the time reset.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.780
I think it would make more sense to count minutes on a per session basis, but whatever.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.080
The whole midnight cutoff thing works too, I guess.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.040
Finally, I noticed that my trainer’s hairstyle changed!

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.460
It’s in a short ponytail now:

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.860
Before it was sort of a short hairstyle.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.360
Don’t ask me why I noticed this.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.020
Let’s just say it was only about last week that I noticed she didn’t actually move her lips.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.400
I’m not usually staring at her lips… Previously I thought it would be cool if you could “dress up” your trainer.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.220
I guess that’s kind of a uniquely Japanese thing that culturally people might want to do.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.720
I guess it’s cool if the trainer just has a mind of their own as well.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.700
I think that the outfit for the female trainer might’ve gotten a bit more conservative.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.720
It looks like in the old Wii Fit commercials she’s wearing a shorter top (and showing more tummy) as seen here:

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.000
Anyway, I should probably be paying less attention to the actual trainer and more attention to working out.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.660
Which is working pretty well for me, actually.
