Right now I’m trying to write an app for the new Facebook Platform.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.840
I’m finding it highly distracting, since I’m literally ON Facebook while trying to get work done.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.460
It’s sort of like trying to type up a term paper, while SWIMMING IN A SWIMMING POOL!

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.180
Nevertheless, it’s a somewhat simple app (nothing in NP-Complete space) so maybe I’ll have it done by tomorrow.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.100
PS The “i can has cheezeburger?” application is probably the single best one I’ve encountered so far.
