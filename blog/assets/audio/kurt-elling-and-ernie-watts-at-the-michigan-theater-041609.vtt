Kurt Elling and Ernie Watts at The Michigan Theater 04/16/09

00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:08.532
Published on April 21, 2009.

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:13.767
I saw Kurt Elling w/ Ernie Watts at the Michigan Theater last Thursday.

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:21.060
The program was billed as “Dedicated to You,” in which Kurt re-envisions songs from Coltrane/Hartman’s ballad album .

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.234
I really like this album, so I approached the concert with some enthusiasm and also some apprehension.

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:30.711
The instrumentation was kinda interesting.

00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:36.805
There was a combo as a base: Piano, Bass, Drums, Sax.

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:43.538
Then there was a string quartet called ENRON or something (err, it was ETHEL) included in the instrumentation.

00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:48.353
This made the music seem a bit more fancy, but also more… orchestrated.

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:51.970
I thought it took away from the jazziness of the performance.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.746
Like a real jazz performance will be a bit impromptu.

00:00:56.246 --> 00:01:03.918
The strings can’t really improvise along with the rest of the band (at least not in 4 part harmony) so everything is a little more rigid.

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:10.192
Anyway, I think the set included all the songs on the aforementioned cd, but in different arrangements.

00:01:10.692 --> 00:01:16.446
Some were converted into non-ballads and I think one was played at ballad speed but in a double-time feel.

00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:20.062
Can’t really remember everything because I wasn’t taking notes.

00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:24.638
I do recall that I didn’t really like the arrangement for “My One and Only Love.”

00:01:25.138 --> 00:01:30.252
I thought it should’ve been given a real ballad treatment instead of the uptempo version that wasn’t very long.

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:33.250
I mean, the concert wasn’t bad or anything.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.869
Not at all.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.287
Elling was a pretty good singer.

00:01:37.787 --> 00:01:43.620
Even though he kind of overdid the loungey moving away from the mic and then getting closer to it to change dynamics thing.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.839
You know what I mean?

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:47.257
He also had some funny movements.

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:52.152
He has a good voice, but he also seemed to mess around with the vocals a little too much.

00:01:52.652 --> 00:02:00.324
That’s okay for people who are familiar with the subject matter but for people hearing a standard ballad for the first time it makes it harder to listen to.

00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:07.877
I wonder if listening to the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra (a definitely old-school group) is making me kind of snotty.

00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:11.893
LCJO gets criticized for not being more modern.

00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:14.231
But I like the old school sound!

00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:22.003
There were times when the Elling group really got in the groove (or as we jazz musicians like to call it, “in the pocket”), which was great.

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:25.140
I really like the straightahead jazz sound.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.197
I guess I really shouldn’t complain though.

00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:31.254
I was happy with the concert for the most part.

00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:36.010
Towards the end Elling brought out some old jazz singer dude.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.586
I didn’t know who he was at the time but I just looked it up and it was Jon Hendricks.

00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:43.882
He came on for the last two songs and scatted.

00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:49.417
The first was Bessie’s Blues , a Coltrane tune that wasn’t on the ballad cd.

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:52.794
I think this was one of the times the group really jelled.

00:02:53.294 --> 00:02:55.771
Then they played Bye Bye Blackbird.

00:02:56.271 --> 00:03:00.506
Kurt sang the Miles Davis solo of it using some made up lyrics.

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:06.520
It was kind of cool because I think a lot of people recognized that it was the Miles Davis solo and appreciated it.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:15.891
It’s also kind of cool because it requires secret jazz knowledge to pick up on it!!! Oh, and after I looked it up I learned that Jon Hendricks actually did this in 1986.

00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:20.466
So I guess Kurt was doing a tribute to Jon, while Jon was standing there.

00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:24.982
During Bye Bye Blackbird, Jon was taking a solo.

00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:33.873
It looked like he was taking a longer solo than everyone had anticipated, so I think Kurt was trying to figure out how to signal to him that the song needed to end.

00:03:34.373 --> 00:03:37.330
I mean, they were probably cool having him take the solo.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.947
But he most likely didn’t do a rehearsal with the guys.

00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:47.200
So it was pretty entertaining watching the guys figuring out how to end the song while the guy was taking a long ass solo.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.139
That’s how jazz people roll.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:56.851
The closers were definitely the right choice because they had high crowd-pleasing potential (blues and a well known standard).

00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:59.909
I think everyone left happy, including me.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:08.959
While I think the source material for the concert is timeless, and perhaps shouldn’t be messed with, they did an okay job and the concert as a standalone event was good.

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.693
It’s kind of hard to please and live up to standards when you leave yourself open to comparison with Johnny Hartman and John Coltrane…

00:04:16.693 --> 00:04:26.283
ALSO: After doing even more research (lookin’ on Youtube) it seems as though Kurt sang with Bob Mintzer, one of my favorite mustached modern composers.

00:04:26.783 --> 00:04:33.016
Though apparently he didn’t sing “My Foolish Heart” on the album which I really, really like, he did sing it live with Bob . Neat-o.
