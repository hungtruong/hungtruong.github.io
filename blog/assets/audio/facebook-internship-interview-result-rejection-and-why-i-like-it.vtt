Facebook Internship Interview Result: Rejection! And Why I Like It…

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.380
Published on October 27, 2007.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.340
So I got a polite (aren’t they always?) email from a recruiter at Facebook about my interview.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.800
Rejection. I guess I’m not too surprised since Facebook is everyone’s favorite company right now.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.540
Apparently there are billions of people who want to get a job/internship there, and currently, there’s like ~300 employees.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.520
So I didn’t have a very good chance from the start.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.600
Of course, my thought process immediately after reading the message went something like this:

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.160
Stage 1: Retaliatory.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.300
“I’m going to create the next Facebook-killer and they’ll all regret the day they rejected me!”

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.800
Stage 2: Somewhat more realistic, optimistic.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.820
“I’m going to create something they can’t help but acquire, which will be my ‘in!’”

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.840
Stage 3: Realistic: “Okay, I guess I’ll just improve and maybe try again next year.”

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.920
People might wonder why I’m so open to listing my rejections publicly.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.780
I think the reason is that I’m not ashamed by them; I actually tend to get motivated instead.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:18.960
For example, when I was rejected by Berkeley , Georgia Tech , UC Irvine and Iowa State , I decided that I’d work extra hard when I finally did begin grad school at Michigan.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.980
And I think I’ve been doing a job of getting involved academically.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:32.780
When I was rejected by Google , I decided I’d become a better programmer (in addition to becoming more interested in real research with stuff like social networks, etc).

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:43.680
Plus I made MapsKrieg shortly after the rejection (mostly because I needed to find an apartment, but if I had given up on Google, I might’ve used the Yahoo Maps API instead…).

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.800
Apparently I still need to work on this aspect a bit since the Facebook interview was basically a programming/algorithmic question.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.420
The “interview” was so short that I doubt anything meaningful about my abilities could have been evaluated.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:08.880
Sure, I didn’t prove P=NP, but I thought I did okay… I think it was a matter of the process being way too competitive (or at least, that’s how I’ll rationalize it to make myself feel better).

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.600
So what does this latest rejection mean for me?

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.220
It means I’ll be working a lot harder in my networks class, for one.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.800
I’m working on a fairly interesting project, so hopefully that’ll buff my otherwise slim portfolio.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.420
Facebook is the only (should I say first?) company to reject me so far for Summer internships.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.640
So I still have a few other good companies to try.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.600
In two years (more like one and a half, now), there might be a better company I’d like to work for.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.380
I still have a lot of time before I graduate, so hopefully I can become “acceptance worthy” material by then.
