New Threadless T-Shirts That Don’t Suck!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.020
Published on August 07, 2006.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.620
Recently, there’s been quite a dearth of good threadless shirts.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.240
Like, seriously, they’re all so pretentious and “cool.”

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.500
Well, this week brings shirts that I might actually buy.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.480
If only there were a $10 sale…

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.640
Honk if you are about to run me over.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.140
So this one’s just a textual tee.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.080
But it’s clever!

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.340
And I like clever t-shirts!

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.960
Oh, threadless, way to mock all of those people who misuse the “Honk if you’re X” snowclone .

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.000
Though it would be ironic if I wore this shirt and was actually run over, I think the odds of that happening are fairly slim.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.820
Since it’s only text, this shirt is $12 instead of $15.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.080
Does that mean it’ll be $7 during a $10 sale? Hmmm…

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.360
Adultery

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.740
Aww, threadless can even make a serious issue like adultery seem like cute fun.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.680
Question: Is the hot dog currently with the mustard, and thinking of cheating with the ketchup?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.340
Or is the hot dog cheating on the ketchup with mustard, and regretting the decision?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.100
Ambition Killed The Cat

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.040
While it’s sad to learn that the cat perishes in this shirt, it’s still pretty damn cute.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.460
This is a reprint, so I guess tons of people bought it and wanted more.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.240
Good job for bringing it back!

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.780
Now go vote for this shirt to be reprinted! Do it!

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.140
Yep, so a few good shirts from threadless.com this week.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.680
Not that they’re good enough for me to buy for full price.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.620
If there was a $10 sale on these, I’d be all over em, though.
