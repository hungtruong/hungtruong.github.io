00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
My first DDR arcade experience!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.780
Published on January 03, 2006.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.420
First off, sorry for not posting very much.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.480
I’ve kinda been busy with my other blog and whatnot.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.660
Speaking of my other blog, here’s a post from it that you might enjoy.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.960
It details my harrowing journey to the arcade…

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.280
So last weekend, a couple of out-of-town buddies called me up and wanted to hang out.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.260
Their idea? Go to the mall.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.000
A trip to the mall isn’t really my idea of a good time, but I hadn’t seen those guys in a while, so off we went.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.760
While at the mall, the subject of DDR came up.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.460
I’m not one to go to the mall often (probably 3-4 times a year), so naturally I don’t play DDR at the arcade that often either.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.240
Oh, I guess the title of this post is kinda misleading then.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.820
It wasn’t my “first” DDR Arcade experience; Just the first one where I was actually capable completing a song on my own…

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.460
Anyway, it was decided that if Natrick* payed, Burtis* and I would dance for him.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.640
And dance we did.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.460
Did I mention there’s videos?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.360
Yes, luckily my New Year’s resolutions did not involve refraining from embarassing myself in front of the internet.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340
So here’s the result of our escapades:

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.220
First we warmed up with “Get up ‘n Move.”

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:35.640
I think this was on standard difficulty. I hadn’t really played at the arcade before, and my feet kept getting stuck where the arrows are. I guess I need drag my feet less (it’s easy when it’s just the dance mat!).

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.600
There was a crowd of people behind us, but after realizing me and Burtis sucked, they all ran away to Hot Topic or something.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.120
Next off, we played “Look to the Sky” on standard mode.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.780
I forget which mix it was.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.840
I thought I combo’ed through it and would get a AA, but I only got an A.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.560
This is when Burtis thought it would be a good idea to stop trying to stay alive and start showboating.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.580
I have to admit it, though, he’s a great dancer.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.960
He even got a bunch of little kids to watch us!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.080
Finally, we decided to go out with a bang and play “Mobo Moga” on heavy mode.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.700
I can sometimes AA this one at home if I’m lucky.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.800
Anyway, I tried to keep us alive, but it was for naught.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.860
We failed somewhere in the middle.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.200
If only Burtis would have concentrated!!!

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.680
Overall, it was a pretty fun excursion.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.260
I like the coolness of the metal pad, but it’d take some time to get used to.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.240
I think red octane sells a metal pad like the arcade, but it’s like, $200!

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.700
Maybe I’ll buy a DDR Machine when I become a millionare…

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.260
