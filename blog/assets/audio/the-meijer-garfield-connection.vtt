Meijer, the grocery store I usually frequent, uses Garfield the cat as a sort of product mascot.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.040
I hate Garfield.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.900
Garfield is probably the least funny comic in existence.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.880
The comics are so bad that removing all traces of Garfield makes them funnier .

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.800
So it’s strange to see Meijer use such a hated cat as a mascot.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.220
Personally, seeing Garfield on a product makes me want to buy it less.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.600
I used to like Garfield when I was a kid.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.020
It’s probably because back then, my brain wasn’t fully developed or something.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.060
Anyway, I bought some Meijer String Cheese today.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.000
It’s pretty good, despite the existence of Garfield as a mascot.
