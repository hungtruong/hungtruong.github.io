Craigslist and Google Maps Mashup Thingy: Day 1

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.780
Published on April 05, 2007.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.020
So I’m sort of looking for housing in Michigan since I’m gonna be living there for two years.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.600
The apartments apparently go fast, so I should be looking for them a few months ago.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.380
Which is to say now.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.940
A while back, some guy made a mashup of Craigslist and Google Maps.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.720
HousingMaps shows a giant google map with pushpins corresponding to communities on Craigslist.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.220
I think this was one or two years ago.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.520
Since then, other communities have been added to Craigslist, but the person who wrote this site hasn’t updated anything.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.260
Guess what? Ann Arbor isn’t one of the communities supported by HousingMaps.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:55.180
So I figured it’d be a good exercise in coding (in PHP and some javascript for the Google Maps component) for me to do something similar.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.800
Sure, I’m not doing anything very original, but at least I’ll learn something, and I think it’ll be difficult enough without being impossible.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.920
So far, I’ve gotten the important chunks of info parsed out of the individual Craigslist listings.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.780
Note to Craigslist: Your HTML is horrendous.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.280
It is formed: horribly.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.100
Okay, so maybe it’s not that bad, but it’s certainly not semantic .

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.200
Honestly, figuring out how to parse this very crappily formed HTML took some crazy logic, but I think it came out okay in the end.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.240
Next, I’m going to have to figure out putting these listings into the database (shouldn’t be that hard), so that they can populate the map.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.700
After that, adding stuff to the map and getting the map to do what I want. Now, sleep.
