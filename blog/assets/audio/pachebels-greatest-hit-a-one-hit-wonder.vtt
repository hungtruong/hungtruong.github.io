Pachebel’s Greatest Hit: A One-Hit Wonder

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.100
Published on November 18, 2007.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.620
While waiting for the TMBG concert, I killed some time at the Borders across the street from the Michigan Theater.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.600
Apparently this is the headquarters of Borders, though it isn’t the first Borders ever.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.300
Originally it was located above the State Theater.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.880
Anyway, I was in the music section, and came across this cd entitled “Pachebel’s Greatest Hit.”

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.540
Yes, greatest hit. Singular.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:43.020
The cd consists of a bunch of different versions of Canon in D. If the inherent repetitiveness of the song (it’s a fucking canon !) wasn’t enough for you, now you can listen to it 8 different times!

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.040
Next up, “Variations on ‘Row, Row, Row Your Boat!’”
