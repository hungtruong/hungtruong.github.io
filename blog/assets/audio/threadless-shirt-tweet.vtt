I saw this new shirt on Threadless and was surprised it hadn’t already done!

Birds have probably known about Twitter for much longer than we have (early bird adopters).

00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:26.115
I like the fact that the Twitter interface has been recreated in a bird speech bubble, but I have a feeling the shirt will be outdated pretty soon (like when Twitter decides to come out with New New Twitter).

Get Tweet before it’s outdated!
