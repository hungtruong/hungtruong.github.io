Apple Internship Phone Interview + Verdict!

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on February 24, 2008.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.900
I had my Apple phone interview on Friday.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.080
It went well, except for all of the questions I couldn’t answer! orz.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.360
About five seconds into the interview, I realized that the description given to me and the actual content of the internship would be quite different.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:36.900
The position was described as “iPhone QA Engineer,” which listed duties like “functional testing of iPhone applications” and “design and implementation of test plans and test cases, risk analysis, & integration testing across the system.”

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.180
The description that my interviewer gave was that I’d be working on an internal iPhone web application for tracking test results and other stuff.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.080
Definitely not as interesting as I thought it would be.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.980
It’s probably still kind of cool, but not as cool as doing actual QA on the iPhone.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.460
By the time the interview had finished, I knew it would be a bad fit and that I would get an email with the same sentiments.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.720
Sure enough, about two hours after the interview had ended I got an email from the recruiter saying there wasn’t a fit.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.140
He said he’d send it to a few other departments in Apple as well. Cool guy.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:21.020
I’m not too upset about this particular rejection, other than the fact that I feel it was incorrectly described, which cost me a bit of time in my preparation.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.400
It was still a good experience, and I got to ask a few questions about the company culture at Apple.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.960
In other non-news, I actually got a successful internship offer, so to speak.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.940
But it’s not quite official yet so I can’t write about it until it is.
