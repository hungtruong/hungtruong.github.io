For the past few weeks I’ve been learning Android development in order to diversify my skill set a bit.

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:17.464
Plus I needed to justify buying a Nexus 7 tablet somehow.

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:26.755
I decided to learn a bit using the Big Nerd Ranch book, and once I went through enough examples I was confident enough to attempt recreating my Threadless app for Android.

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:36.146
I was planning on reaching feature parity with the iOS app before releasing it, but I decided that a more frequent update cadence is probably better when it’s possible.

00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:42.799
The Google Play store makes it really easy to alpha and beta test, as well as promote beta builds to production.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:50.891
Rather than taking a week to find out that your app does not meet the requirements of Apple, you can simply push out a build and it’ll be ready in a few hours.

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:54.987
This is probably one of the best “features” of being an Android developer.

00:00:55.987 --> 00:01:00.941
While Android has its fair share of “WTF” features, I actually kind of like it.

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:14.228
I think it’s quickly getting to the point where Android’s advantages (amazing integration with very high quality Google products) will outweigh Apple’s (Super awesome third party applications albeit running in a tightly confined sandbox).
