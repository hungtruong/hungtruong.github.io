Threadless Spring Broke Sale – $10 T-Shirts!

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.220
Published on March 05, 2007.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.380
So there’s another $10 t-shirt sale goin’ on at Threadless.com .

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.520
I had a lot of referral credits ($30 worth) so I picked up some tees.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.060
I was only gonna order one, but then they said I had to use all of my credit at once, so I ordered 3. Stupid Threadless!

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.060
Anyway, here’s what I ordered:

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.660
Pencil Forest

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.680
When I saw Pencil Forest debut a few weeks ago (or was it last week?) I thought it was pretty cool.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.020
But not $15 cool.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.600
Luckily, it’s $10 cool.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.680
It sorta doesn’t make sense though.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.300
So the guy is cutting down the tress to make pencils?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.920
But why are the trees made of pencil shavings?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.820
Oh well, I guess it doesn’t really need to make sense.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.260
Para Poppins

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:09.080
I’ve wanted Para Poppins for a while now, though I don’t think it’s ever been in stock during a $10, which is usually when I’ll buy shirts from threadless.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.060
It’s just the kind of weird, off-beat shirt that I find myself gravitated towards.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.680
I’m sure Mary Poppins will show those insurgents who’s boss!

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.960
Stone Jungle

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.300
Stone Jungle is a pretty cool looking shirt that has some city stuff on the top, and nature stuff on the bottom!

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.160
How artsy fartsy!

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.140
I got it because I was forced to get 3 shirts.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.280
I like the design, plus green is my favorite color, so yeah, there ya go.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.960
In fact, I just noticed that all the shirts I ordered today have a shade of green in them… Weird.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.560
The Threadless Spring Broke sale lasts until March 12, so get the shirts you want now!

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.700
And vote for this shirt to be reprinted!!!
