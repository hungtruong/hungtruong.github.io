Google Phone Interview Get!

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.140
Published on February 02, 2007.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.020
In last semester’s Software Engineering class, I had a classmate who was an intern at Google.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.080
We both went to the Google Information Session a while back, where I got a sweet, sweet Google shirt.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.060
Anyway, he was awesome enough to offer to forward my resume internally.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.360
After a few weeks and some other paperwork, I’ve been offered a phone interview!

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.520
I’m not too sure how many people get to this point, but I’m pretty stoked about it.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.700
I’ve read that the interviews are pretty hard, though they really should be.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.480
I mean, it’s Google, after all!

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.540
I should be getting a date for the phone interview very soon.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.920
Until then, I think I’ll try and brush up on my algorithms , asymptotic analysis , probability , and combinatorics !

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.380
Don’t fail me now, Introduction to Algorithms !

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.980
I’m feeling lucky!
