Nintendo Wii – Super Paper Mario Mini Review

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.740

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.500
I just got Super Paper Mario for the Nintendo Wii yesterday.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I played through the first chapter, so here’s my quick mini-review.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.880
Super Paper Mario is different from the other Paper Mario games in a big way.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.260
The RPG elements have been pretty much removed.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.520
Now, instead of taking turns attacking and defending, Mario just attacks the enemies in real time.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.340
So it’s more like the original Super Mario, except with hit points and stats.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.220
I’m not too happy with this, since I liked the RPGness of Paper Mario.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.120
I thought Paper Mario was just an extension of the old Super Mario RPG games.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.460
Now that they’ve got rid of the RPG, it’s just not as fun.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.620
The graphics are pretty neat though.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.480
There’s this thing where you flip from 2D mode to 3D mode.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.540
It’s like going from a flat world to three dimensions.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.720
You can find hidden stuff and avoid the 2D enemies in 3D mode.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.720
The humor is still intact, too.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.740
There’s a lot of references to the original Super Mario Bros. game.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.400
There’s even the super mushroom that turns you into a giant version of the pixellated Mario.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.480
Super Paper Mario is still fun, but I have a feeling it would’ve been better if they had kept the gameplay from Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door intact.
