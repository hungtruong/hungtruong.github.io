Go Bluegle!

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.300
Published on September 16, 2007.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.420
So before the Michigan/Notre Dame game yesterday, I went to some “Google Tailgate” thingy.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.800
Basically, some tents were set up for people to enter and be brainwashed into the cult of Google.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.420
Or something like that.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.180
We actually arrived pretty late, but there were still free things to be acquired.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.680
Like a girl was walking around asking Google/Ann Arbor questions, and if you got it right, you’d get a maize Google shirt!

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.140
I have to say, this shirt is freaking awesome.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.840
It’s wearable to game days plus it has the Google logo on it!

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.480
The questions ranged from easy to difficult.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.020
I was with two other friends, and the Googlers allowed us to combine our powers to summon Captain Planet (or at least to answer questions).

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.340
The first one was “What is Google’s motto?”

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.440
In a mental lapse unbecoming of me, I said “Do no evil” when it’s really “Don’t be evil.”

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.580
Oh well, they gave me the shirt anyway (It’d be kind of ironic for them not to, what with the motto saying not to be evil and all).

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.820
The second one was “What unusual thing does Borders (in Ann Arbor) and Google allow in their buildings?”

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.520
The girl gave us a hint that it wasn’t something like “books.”

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.700
Since when are books unusual?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.440
I said it was probably dogs, since Google lets employees take their dogs to work.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.940
I didn’t know Borders did though.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.920
And indeed, we got shirt #2.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.880
The last question was “Who is Google’s CEO?”

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.500
Who knows this crap?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.440
Well, I do, and my friend did, but we’re nerds.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.340
So we went 3/3.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.120
Thanks, Eric Schmidt!

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:53.560
There was also a bowl ‘o pens that I ransacked (I already have a green pen from my interview, but I decided to add a blue one to my collection) and some free ice cream.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.040
One last observation: It’s pretty obvious that the Google office in Ann Arbor is an adwords office.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.860
I say this because all of the employees I saw are beautiful, beautiful people.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.960
Whereas the Googleplex has some smokin’ HR people and, well, engineering people.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.660
Note that I am not beyond calling myself an engineering person.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.060
Fin.
