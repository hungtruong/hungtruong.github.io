Stats Project: Sociability of Musical Instruments Using Facebook Data

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.180
Published on May 08, 2008.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.740
For my SI 544: Stats class this semester, I worked with two cool dudes, Jim Laing and Sameer Halai .

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.840
Our project involved using data gathered from a Facebook application to test a hypothesis about the perceived sociability of certain musical instruments.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.960
If you recall, I wrote a blog post a few months ago about the viral vs. non-viral growth of Facebook applications that I had developed .

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.420
One of those apps, Musical Instruments , lets you list which musical instruments you play.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.680
It’s kind of fun because some people play really whacked-out instruments (I play pianica and soprano trombone).

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:54.700
I think playing instruments is typically a pretty social experience, which sort of led me to think about comparing the “sociability” of certain instruments to each other with the data gathered from this app.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.100
Users input their instruments via an autocompleting text field.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.680
If an instrument already exists in the database (and at least 3 or so users have claimed it), it will autocomplete.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.860
In the above screenshot, I’ve typed “Trumpet” and you can see there’s many different types of trumpet to choose from.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.600
A user can also type an instrument that doesn’t yet exist in the database and it’ll be added automatically.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.220
This kind of free vocabulary is nice because it doesn’t require an administrator to continuously accept new instruments.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.940
The data that the application has access to are:

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.900
The user’s FBID (Their unique Facebook user ID in the form of a number)

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.940
The instruments that the user claims to play

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.100
The number of friends that the user has

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.660
We ended up getting 8603 rows of data (user/instrument pairs).

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.880
After getting a bunch of free text instruments, we went to work classifying many of them into groups and subgroups.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.740
So Piccolo is in the group “Flute” and subgroup “Woodwind.”

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.540
We then generated a survey for people to rank 16 instruments in order of sociability.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.600
That is, people who play x instrument probably have more friends than y instrument.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.680
The survey results showed that people thought Vocalists had the most friends and that Guitar was pretty popular too.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.160
From the application data and survey results, we formed a hypothesis.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.540
We hypothesized that the instruments given high sociability rank would also have statistically higher mean numbers of friends.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.960
So people who played Guitar would have more friends than people who played Flute.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.880
First, we did some basic analysis of the data using R , the free stats program that we were using for class assignments and labs.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.880
This figure shows the histogram of frequency of number of friends.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.380
Basically, many people have 0-100 friends, less people have 101-200 friends, etc.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.800
This probably follows a power law curve, but we didn’t think it would be really important to find the alpha or anything for our purposes.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.640
This is a graph of the mean number of friends, by instrument.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.500
This looks like a pretty standard normal distribution and it shows off the central limit theorem that Lada is always talking about in class.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.140
This is just a boxplot of all of the classified instruments and their # of friends.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.160
There are some crazy outliers; people who have 1000 friends.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.540
From this boxplot, it’s hard to make out whether or not any of the means are actually statistically significant.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.900
Finally, we ran pairwise t-tests on each set of instruments.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.600
We could see that there was a significant difference in the mean number of friends for certain instruments.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.260
For example, Guitar and Horn, Guitar and Oboe, and Guitar and Saxophone.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.560
Looking at the mean number of friends for these instruments, Saxophone players had on average 20 more friends than Guitar players.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.020
This is interesting because Saxophone was ranked 10.7 (not very sociable) and Guitar was ranked very sociable.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.820
The scope of this project was pretty small, and given some more time, I think we could’ve come up with some more interesting conclusions.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:24.880
Stuff like “is flute really a girly instrument?” by looking at the average number of female flute players vs male flute players and “do guitar players get more chicks?” by looking at relationship status of guitar players vs. something like trumpet players (personal burn!).

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.640
I was glad my Facebook app actually provided some interesting data.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.940
I’ve always been sort of skeptical to the ability of Facebook apps to be profitable.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.960
I think the data that the apps provide is very valuable in the context of social network research.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.980
Anyway, I hope you found this post to be somewhat entertaining.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.440
I’ve also uploaded the project report and presentation slides in PDF if you want to check them out.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.120
Many thanks to Jim and Sameer for sharing much of the work in this project.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.860
I ended up providing data, formatting it, and presenting the final presentation, so props to my teammates!
