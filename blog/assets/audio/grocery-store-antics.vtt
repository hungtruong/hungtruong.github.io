Grocery Store Antics!

00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:10.251
I had a really weird dream in-between snoozes this morning.

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:16.345
I’m writing this post on my iPhone on my way to work (don’t worry, I commute by bus).

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:20.062
The first part of my dream was at some kind of museum.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.758
It was a place where I had gone as a kid.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:28.414
I saw a hallway with a bunch of mechanical educational arcade type games.

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:30.352
They were old.

00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:32.930
I think one was of Dick and Jane.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.944
I felt the kind of nostalgia that you get going to a place you used to frequent as a kid but rarely as an adult.

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:43.519
Think back to elementary school when they’d send you to the same place every year or semester.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.097
Like the natural history museum for me.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:51.572
The museum quickly got boring so my dream transitioned me to shopping at a grocery store.

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:53.590
I think it was Meijer.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:03.920
Shopping got boring in the dream (which strangely never happens in real life) and I resorted to riding my shopping cart around with another dude who kinda seemed like my friend Matt Strand.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.858
But I don’t think it was him.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:18.766
Then some security guards came up to us with “energizer” brand binders (I could tell because they were drumming them like the energizer bunny, except vertically because the bunny has a bass drum and these guys were playing them like snares).

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:23.262
They were going to take us to the manager’s office on the 9th floor or something.

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:26.159
I tried to make small talk with the guards.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.935
Like “I bet a lot of people mess with the shopping carts and ride on them!”

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:35.070
I was trying to make it appear less lame that a 26 year old got caught goofing off.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.127
Then my second snooze alarm woke me up.

00:01:39.127 --> 00:01:45.361
It seems impossible that my long dream happened in the span of 10 minutes but I guess that’s how our brains work!
