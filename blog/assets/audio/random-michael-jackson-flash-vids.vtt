Random Michael Jackson Flash Vids

00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:06.774
Published on June 26, 2009.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.372
What the hey!?

00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:12.909
Michael Jackson died today (yesterday)!

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.927
Well that’s kind of a bummer.

00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:22.459
I mostly spent most of the evening listening to his music (I went to the library and grabbed History) and watching music videos on YouTube.

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:32.890
Also, I just remembered about the random Super Mario Bros. sprite animations that some Japanese person (sikamako) made using graphics from the old Genesis game, Moonwalker !

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.787
I had only previously linked to one.

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:39.643
So I thought that in tribute of MJ, I’d link to all of them.

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:41.661
They’re all really weird:

00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:44.339
Super Michael Bros.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.438
I think this is the original one.

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:49.536
I don’t remember where I got it.

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:52.273
Seems sort of normal enough.

00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:55.490
Just MJ running through a few Mario stages.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.529
Michael Quest

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:01.107
Michael Quest is a little weirder.

00:01:01.607 --> 00:01:05.203
Basically he comes in and pwns a bunch of video games.

00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:07.780
Then some red ninjas come in?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.917
Then MJ is revived by Luigi?

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:13.974
And he turns into the metal thing from Moonwalker.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.872
Yeah, this really makes no sense.

00:01:17.372 --> 00:01:18.251
Just watch it.

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:20.929
Michael Fantasy

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:23.707
It actually gets weirder.

00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:26.924
There’s a flashback to Michael Quest (of course).

00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:32.778
Then the princess rides a gigantic Zangief from SFII to destroy the earth.

00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:38.952
This is foreshadowed before it actually happens, so then a bunch of random video game characters try and stop it.

00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:42.329
And of course, Michael Jackson saves the day again.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.847
Michael Forever

00:01:46.347 --> 00:01:48.185
I believe this is the last one.

00:01:48.685 --> 00:02:04.190
I think Michael finds some Dragon Balls, revives some characters, then has to stop Princess Peach again, this time riding a giant E. Honda… There’s a lot of Japanese pop cultural references (like Doraemon, Dragon Ball, etc) and I probably don’t understand all of them.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.724
Suffice it to say that MJ is still a badass in this one. Crisis averted.
