Letterpress in Apple iLife ’11

Today I decided to have the Apple “Back to Mac” keynote stream while working on other stuff.

00:00:14.108 --> 00:00:21.939
I was literally setting up a print job in my composing stick when I heard Steve Jobs mention that iLife will have a letterpress printing option.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.273
I never imagined that Apple would move in on my turf when I decided to get an old style printing press !

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:34.947
It looks like you’ll be able to order prints from a number of templates, some of which can also include photos:

00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:41.860
I think it’s neat that letterpress is becoming mainstream (again) enough that it warrants a feature in iLife.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.071
As far as my concerns about taking away business (which I haven’t quite decided to get into), I think it’s good that Apple’s pushing this kind of typing further into the mainstream.

00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:57.325
There’ll probably be a lot more people interested in letterpress, and not just for the personalized photo cards, etc.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:02.880
On a technical note, I’m interested how Apple is going to farm out the print jobs.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.015
Do they have their own print shop with all the Heidelberg machines, or are they partnering with a shop?

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:12.750
Depending on the volume of orders, I wonder what their turnaround time would be.
