To Google Voice or Not To Google Voice?

00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:06.694
Published on July 16, 2009.

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:13.288
I recently got a new iPhone 3GS (32GB!) and with it a new phone number.

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:17.943
I’ve had a Google Voice number from way back when it was called GrandCentral .

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:21.959
I never used it because I found the integration a bit lacking.

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:28.693
As I now must inform people of my new number, I was thinking about giving them the Google Voice one instead of the “real” one.

00:00:29.193 --> 00:00:36.785
This is also as Google Voice is getting considerable buzz since it’s finally giving away invites after closing off the service quite some time ago.

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:40.661
Here are some pros and cons to either choice.

00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:42.301
Pros :

00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:46.817
I don’t have to ever tell people I’m changing my phone number again in the future.

00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:50.054
Neat voicemail transcripting.

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:57.367
Routing calls from phone to phone (I might want it to go to my work phone at certain times, mobile at other times)

00:00:58.367 --> 00:00:59.806
Googliness?

00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:01.924
Cons :

00:01:02.924 --> 00:01:05.961
The voicemail system won’t be integrated into my iPhone

00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:10.157
There isn’t an official iPhone app for Google Voice yet.

00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:16.352
SMS doesn’t work with short codes (40404 for Twitter)

00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:20.468
Calls made through voice won’t count as “mobile-to-mobile.”

00:01:21.468 --> 00:01:23.386
Other integration issues.

00:01:24.386 --> 00:01:26.863
Possible dependency issues.

00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:33.457
For me, Google Voice is pretty cool, but not cool enough to rely on because of its crappy integration.

00:01:33.957 --> 00:01:40.909
By crappy integration, I mean that Google Voice just simply cannot expect to integrate itself well into other companies’ phone systems.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.727
There are a number of examples of this.

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:49.421
One is that if I want to send a text to someone, I need to use Google Voice to do it instead of my phone.

00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.958
This adds a layer of obfuscation to the process.

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:56.015
Here’s what the help doc on Google Voice says:

00:01:57.015 --> 00:02:02.769
Call, Voicemail and SMS Issues: Receiving SMS on phone from 406 numbers

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:09.203
When you send an SMS through Google Voice, the SMS appears to be sent from your Google number.

00:02:09.703 --> 00:02:21.291
When someone sends an SMS to your Google number, and it’s forwarded to your mobile phone, it won’t appear as from the sender’s actual number (e.g., the SMS may appear from 1-406-xxx-xxxx).

00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:32.580
This is so that when you reply to the 1-406-xxx-xxxx number from your phone, the SMS you send appears to be sent from your Google number and will be saved in your Google Voice inbox.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.897
Holy crap, that’s just confusing!

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:42.790
Another example of Google Voice not playing well with existing companies’ systems would be mobile-to-mobile calls.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.163
If I call my sister using Google Voice, the call probably won’t count as “free” since it’s going to Google instead of directly to her phone number.

00:02:50.663 --> 00:02:57.216
Though apparently if you add the Google Voice number to T-Mobile’s “Faves” you could get some pretty interesting free call results…

00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:04.369
Another peeve I have about Google Voice is that they’ve decided to make the mobile apps for Blackberry and Android thus far.

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:12.940
I wonder if this is because the iPhone is a competitor to their own Android platform or if they just decided it would be easier, or for any other reason.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:23.110
It kind of shows a “ Microsoft Moment ” for lack of better term for Google; writing software to serve their own ends versus writing software to reach their customers on the platform they use.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:33.600
I don’t have any numbers to back this up though (are there more Android+Blackberry users than iPhone?), so at this point I’m just complaining because I have an iPhone and it doesn’t have an app.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.632
For now I will ditch Google Voice (or just not use it) until it can be integrated effortlessly into my own mobile phone’s system.

00:03:42.132 --> 00:03:45.249
The whole point of using Google Voice is to simplify things.

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:51.582
I can see it’ll be a really complicated road ahead for Google to actually implement this, but I hope they do.

00:03:52.082 --> 00:03:55.518
It almost surely means they’ll need to work with phone companies directly.

00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:58.975
This will probably take time and lots of money.

00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:02.352
I’ll just stick with my own phone’s capabilities until then.
