Windows 7 RC Impressions (on a PC!)

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:07.094
Published on August 06, 2009.

00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:11.450
I made the switch from PC to Mac a pretty long time ago.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:20.581
It’s been about two years since I started using my first Macbook and a few months since I went exclusively to using OS X (when my PC crapped out).

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:32.109
I recently got bored and decided to fix up my PC and put Win 7 RC on it (I think the thing flipped out when I got a new hard drive and it somehow got two Win XPs into the boot registry thing).

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:39.103
I already tried installing Win 7 Beta on my Macbook Pro a few times via Boot Camp and VMWare Fusion.

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:42.000
They were both pretty bad solutions.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.334
It’s just too much to try and virtualize a modern operating system, and the Boot Camp drivers are just kinda crappy.

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:56.506
My main thing was that Win 7 kept crashing in Boot Camp, losing wireless connections and having a really laggy touchpad interface.

00:00:57.506 --> 00:01:01.261
You may recall that my opinions of Vista were not the most positive.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:07.036
About a year and a half (and an operating system) later, I think the thing is finally pretty good.

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:10.593
The user experience is nice.

00:01:11.093 --> 00:01:16.687
I like the fact that I can hit the window key, then type whatever I want and get a list of programs, etc.

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:24.139
It’s really useful because the control panel is so insanely organized that it’s impossible to find anything in a hierarchical manner.

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:27.436
I guess that’s a mixed complement/critique.

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:33.130
I like the desktop backgrounds, and all the apps I’ve installed so far work pretty well.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.827
I didn’t have to scavenge for a single driver, which was really nice.

00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:46.837
When I managed to buy Windows 7 UK and installed it on my mom’s laptop, however, it was quite a task getting the video card to work (it was an old Dell 300m).

00:01:47.837 --> 00:01:51.752
The only real complaint I have is that file sharing is still really confusing.

00:01:52.252 --> 00:01:58.885
I found out how to access my shared folders from OS X, but I haven’t figured out how to access my Mac from Win 7.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:02.981
Overall, though, Win 7 is actually looking pretty good.

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:08.995
If I actually had a need for this desktop, I might actually use it more often (besides for playing games).

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.812
For now I’ll stick with my trusty Macbook Pro.

00:02:12.312 --> 00:02:16.708
I’m thinking the upcoming Snow Leopard upgrade will keep OS X interesting.
