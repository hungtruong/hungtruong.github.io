I was at Meijer today doing some grocery shopping.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.040
Because that’s what adults do, apparently.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.660
Anyway, I’m almost out of ice cream, so I thought I’d buy some more.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.280
I picked up a flavor called “Blue Moon” that I thought I’ve had before, but maybe not.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.080
Wikipedia says it’s a flavor that’s particular to the Michiganish area.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.860
Apparently it doesn’t have a concrete flavor, with different brands flavoring the ice cream in different ways.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.040
I think it tastes sorta vanilla-ish, and after I read that it’s sorta “fruit loop-ish” I believe that, too.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.720
What’s the point of this post?

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:53.340
I dunno. I do know one thing: Meijer uses Garfield as some kind of brand mascot, and Garfield is the least funny comic I have ever read in my entire life.
