Giant Steps Reunion! Ska Lives! Maybe…

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.020
Published on January 16, 2007.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.740
So last month, this band called Giant Steps had some kind of reunion going on.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.320
I was a dummy and didn’t go.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.900
But The band played on anyway and Tom Siegel, trumpet player, sent me a link to some videos of the event.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.240
I didn’t wanna kill their bandwidth, so I’m putting up the clips on my own site.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.920
Giant Steps was a local (Albuquerque) ska band that was pretty popular during the “third wave” of ska.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.740
I’d pin that era somewhere around 1996 to uh, 2000 or so.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.960
At least, that’s when the third wave was most popular.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.660
As far as I know, Reel Big Fish is still doing their thing.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.540
Anyway, Giant Steps was fairly well known to me, because two of my high school teachers were in it!

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.840
My high school band teacher, Paul Blakey, played baritone sax, and Mr. Siegel, I mean… Tom played trumpet.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.140
How cool is that?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.880
I actually didn’t end up going to many of their gigs, but I did hear them live a few times.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.600
One thing that Tom told me is that you can now buy Giant Step’s CDs on iTunes !

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.980
How cool is that?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.640
I’d still rather have the hard copy though, for nostalgia purposes and whatnot.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.760
Ooh. Also, I remember hearing that “Feel the Thunder” was written about Paul Blakey’s snoring.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I’m not if this is true, but why would anyone lie about that?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.940
