Final Fantasy IV (6, or 3…) Out For Gameboy Advance Today!

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.700
Published on February 05, 2007.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.700
So Final Fantasy VI is being released today for the Gameboy Advance!

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.760
I remember playing this when it was known as Final Fantasy III for the SNES.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.940
I still have it, too.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.820
Something tells me I shouldn’t buy this, since I already own this and I already beat it before.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.120
Plus I have Final Fantasy IV on the GBA which I haven’t beat yet (though I have beat it on the SNES, and I still have it!).

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:44.000
Couple this with the fact that I have Final Fantasy XII unbeaten, and Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess unbeaten, and I do think I have a case for not buying this.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.500
But it’s Final Fantasy VI!!!

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.780
Decisions…
