$10 Holiday Sale at Threadless!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.780
Published on November 19, 2007.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.740
There’s another $10 sale going on at Threadless .

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.080
I think the quality of Threadless shirts has kinda been waning in recent months.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.260
There’s a few fun shirts, but I’ll wait on ordering since this sale lasts until December 16th.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.440
Especially funny is this “ November Was a Good Month ” shirt.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.660
Going to a (sort of) library school, I think I’m starting to think more and more like a librarian.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.520
So I kind of find this shirt more interesting than I really should.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.380
But yeah, maybe I’ll hit the jackpot with a round of good shirts sometime between now and December.
