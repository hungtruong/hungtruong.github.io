Google Phone Interview #1: The Aftermath

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.980
Published on February 09, 2007.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.020
So I finished my first phone interview with Google.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.120
Overall I thought it was very fair and I didn’t get the types of mind-bending puzzles that people claim they are asked.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.720
I won’t disclose the questions I was asked, not because they asked me to, but because I think it would undermine the effectiveness of the interview process itself.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.380
Plus I have a feeling that Google “Googles” to find questions posted online and doesn’t use them anyway.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.260
I had a chance to describe a project that I had worked on.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.800
I chose Notecentric , since it was more complex than Anime Nano and I could say that I worked on the entire thing by myself.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.420
I did a pretty simple (and nervous) high level overview of the system and my reasons for creating it.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.900
The first question I got was a simple data structure implementation efficiency question.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.360
I’m pretty glad I studied my data structures beforehand.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.540
It took me a while (and a few hints) before I came to the correct solution.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.360
It was sort of a “well duh!!” moment, but I’m glad that I at least reached it.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.700
Though it took a while, I thought I did well in rationalizing my ideas and explaining why they wouldn’t work quite right.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.920
Plus coming up with a solution to a problem is very stressful with a real life Google Engineer listening to you think it through!

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.100
I think the interviews are mostly to see how you think, not how quickly you can derive the right answer.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.300
The second question was a pretty open ended one about role playing as a Google Engineer.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.280
I guess that’s as vague as I can get without actually saying what the question was.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.940
I think the question was more about seeing how much I knew about Google and how I would behave in the company itself.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.120
I think I did fairly well in this question, going through a lot of edge cases and coming up with ideas that might those handle edge cases, etc.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.320
I also had a chance to ask a question about Google.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.420
I asked about the 20% projects, as it’s something I find really unique about the company.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.520
I also gave the interviewer a feature request for Gmail, though she wasn’t directly working on that project.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.480
Overall, I think the interview had its desired effect.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.580
Google learned more about my thought process and critical thinking skills.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.120
I probably won’t hear from the recruiter again until Monday at the soonest, since it’s the weekend now.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.740
Hopefully they’ll have another phone interview or even an onsite interview lined up for me shortly.
