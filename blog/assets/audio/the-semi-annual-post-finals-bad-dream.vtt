The Semi-Annual Post-Finals Bad Dream!

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.300
Published on December 13, 2008.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.380
So whenever I finish finals, I always seem to have the same bad dream.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.960
It’s not a nightmare or anything.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.420
Just a dream that’s sort of got a bad scenario in it.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.120
I just finished my final stuff yesterday, so the semi-annual dream came right on time, last night!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.760
It always involves some random class I signed up for at the beginning of the semester that I stop showing up to.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:38.060
Then I realize, maybe on the bus or something, that I totally forgot to do any work for it!!! This semester it was some made up class on something analysis.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.520
The reason I didn’t go is because the teacher was really bad.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.940
For some reason the teacher was Jay Boyden, a grad student assistant from when I was in marching band in undergrad.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.640
No idea why he was in that role because he’s actually a good teacher!

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.560
My series of dreams last night also involved some interesting sub-plots.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:05.460
One was that I was using my computer to show my brother something, then the browser was being really slow switching from Youtube to whatever other tab I had open.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.800
So I blamed this on the OS and remembered I had a copy of Vista!

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.100
So I formatted the hard drive out of frustration and was going to find the Vista disc.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:25.040
But then I realized I had left the disc in Michigan, and for some reason I was in New Mexico for the dream (I wonder what my computer was doing in NM while my stuff was in MI).

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.620
So I just had a formatted computer.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.860
Then another sub-plot was sorta in the world of “ I Am Legend ” and sorta in the world of “ Fallout 3 .”

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.120
There was a town I was trying to get to but a zombie town was in-between it!

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.540
I think the zombies couldn’t get out at night.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.080
But it WAS at night.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.860
Luckily some motorcycle gang was there to shoot flamethrowers at the zombie town so I could pass.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.040
Before this happened, though, there was huge pomp and circumstance.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.420
Like the motorcycles all came in formation and stuff.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.880
Then the zombies were kind of trash talking the gang.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.020
They said something like, “you guys are done for when you eventually run out of gasoline!”

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.720
Then the gang torched the zombies and I was on my way.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.880
So yeah, I’m looking forward to my final semi-annual post-final bad dream some time in May when I graduate!
