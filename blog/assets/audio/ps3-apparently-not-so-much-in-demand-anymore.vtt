PS3 Apparently Not So Much In Demand Anymore…

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.260
Last night on fatwallet, I saw a post about the PS3 being available on Best Buy dot com without having to pay for a ridiculous bundle!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.480
I decided to quickly post it on cheapassgamer before the fatwallet horde took them all.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.920
They’re still available.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.160
Apparently, the PS3 is not really in any kind of demand anymore at all.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.020
Here’s a few select responses to the post I made last night:

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.460
I saw 10 60GB ones in my BB store.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.400
Some people looked at the box for awhile and then wondered off.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.820
I think the $599 price scares most people away.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.140
They had numerous PS3 at BB near Regency here in Jacksonville, FL.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.480
They are just sitting there.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.160
I have passed on PS3’s at two different stores in the last week.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.060
All three stores (Bestbuy and TRU) had more than 5 or 6 just sitting there.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.880
I asked workers in the game area and they both said they had been there a few days.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.460
Just not worth it to most people.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.540
I’ve walked in to BB, Wal-Mart and Target and every store has had PS3s just sitting there and no Wiis to be seen.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.420
Here are the places I saw them this weekend in Houston

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.980
Frys

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.580
2 best buys

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.540
1 EB games

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.980
1 Gamestop

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.580
2 Targets

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.460
1 Walmart

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.900
Ouch. Sorry Sony, I think you’ve lost this round.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.740
Update: I headed over to Target to try and snag a Wii today.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.640
They didn’t have any but then I went to Best Buy to see if they had the Wii.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.620
Apparently I missed the last one by a minute.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.280
I did, however, spot two 60GB PS3s just sitting there, not being sold.
