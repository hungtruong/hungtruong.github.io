Amazon.com Wishlist => Huge River Wishlist

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.420
Published on June 28, 2007.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.100
So I got a message from Amazon.com about my facebook app called “Amazon.com Wishlist.”

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:24.780
Basically, Amazon doesn’t want me to describe my Amazon.com wishlist using the word Amazon… I asked if an exception could be made but the lawyer politely declined.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:34.240
I can understand Amazon’s reasons for wanting to protect its name, but seriously, I can’t use “Amazon” to describe an app that displays an AMAZON.COM Wishlist!?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.360
So I renamed the app “ Huge River Wish List .”

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.660
I think Amazon.com is developing a wishlist app for Facebook of their own, which is the real reason for forcing the name change.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.240
It’s the risk that one takes when developing using an API, though.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.540
I guess I should’ve read the terms more closely.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.360
It’s completely within Amazon’s rights to request that I change them app’s name.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.120
It’s also completely in my rights to develop an app for a competitor to Amazon.com. Hmmm…
