I dream of Listerine

I had this weird dream where I was rinsing my mouth with Listerine, or Scope, or some mouthwash.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.600
Problem was, I was in this sort of wilderness where there wasn’t any sink, and I didn’t want to just spit the Listerine onto the ground.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.980
There were people around, and I think they would not have approved of that.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.960
So I’m walking around looking for a sink, and my mouth is burning because of the Listerine.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.740
Then I come up to a river, and it’s really clean and crystal clear.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.080
I don’t want to spit it out there, because I think it would be rude to mess up the really nice water with my Listerine spit.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.860
I follow the river and come up to a branch where there aren’t any people.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.360
I just decide to spit the Listerine out there because no one is watching.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.580
It feels good having the Listerine out of my mouth, but now I feel bad for hurting the environment.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.280
What does it mean!!!
