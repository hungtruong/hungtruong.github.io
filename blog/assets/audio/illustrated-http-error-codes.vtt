Via Boingboing , I found these awesome Illustrated HTTP Error Codes .

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.460
HTTP error codes are inherently funny to me, because of the all the possible double entendre possibilities involved.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:30.000
I mean, there’s 411: Length Required, 402: Payment Required (!), 414: Requested URL Too Long… The crude joke potential is just too high!

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.980
In fact, Thinkgeek has a line of HTTPanties that exploits this very fact.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.500
But these illustrations don’t pander to the lowest common denominator.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.280
Some of them are funny, like the dog that’s too big for his house (Requested Entity too large).

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.140
Others are just kinda dumb.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.720
But the fact that someone drew these means there’s a bigger nerd out there than I. And I, for one, salute Ape Lad.
