Japanese People Master T-Shirt Folding. Up Next, Potato Peeling!

That’s right, those Japanese people are at it again.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.680
Now they’ve got their sights on removing the skin from potatoes!

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.180
Marvel as they cut a ring around a potato, dunk it in boiling water, then dip it in ice water!

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.560
Afterwards, the skin just peels off!

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.820
This is exactly the same technique I use to flay human flesh!

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.520
I think the magic lies within the expansion and shrinkage of the potato during the boiling and icing.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780
Or maybe I just made that up.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.940
Seriously, though, I’m curious as to what the Japanese still have behind their sleeves.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.200
Cold Fusion, anyone?
