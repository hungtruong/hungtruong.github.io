The Popularity Dialer: Makes You Look Important…

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.580
Published on August 04, 2006.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.340
So there’s this thing called “ The Popularity Dialer ” that lets you pre-schedule a call to your phone…

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.660
Maybe you wanted to look extra important or popular on that hot date.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.920
Or maybe you just needed an excuse to escape from an unpleasant meeting.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.380
With “The Popularity Dialer”, you can plan ahead.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.080
Via a web interface, you can choose to have your phone called at a particular time (or several times).

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:40.300
At the elected time, your phone will be dialed and you will hear a prerecorded message that’s one half of a conversation.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.980
Here’s what the call might sound like:

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.420
The idea is that people will think you’re really important or busy.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.880
While this might work for avoiding people, I have a feeling it won’t make you look cool on a date.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.540
Aren’t there enough asses that take cell phone calls at inappropriate times already!?

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.180
Someone needs to combine this with the previously mentioned Samuel L Jackson call .

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.520
Can you imagine how important you’d look having SLJ call your cell phone?

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.820
He’d be like, “Whassup, I being attacked by ninjas right now. You got my back?” and you’d be like “Hell yeah, Samuel J!”
