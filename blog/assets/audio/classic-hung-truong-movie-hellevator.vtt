Classic Hung Truong Movie: Hellevator

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.660
Published on December 18, 2006.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.540
Back when I was a media arts major (in 2002), I made a movie called “Hellevator.”

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.480
It’s probably the crowning achievement of my career at UNM.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.100
I figured I should put it online for posterity, and include comments before I forget about what happened.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.580
[flv:/blog/video/Hellevator.flv 480 360]

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.420
I skipped putting it on youtube, since the compression sucks.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.160
Here’s some of my director’s commentary:

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.320
The movie was actually based on a two-minute play that I and Brian Hesch wrote during drama class in high school.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.740
The idea was that the two characters would enter the elevator and then just “fall” for the entire thing.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.360
Needless to say, the script was reworked to make it more interesting.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.280
SuperTonic Productions was my made up production company name. The

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.400
Supertonic is the second note in a diatonic scale.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.700
I learned about it in theory during music class.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.120
I thought it was a really cool name because it rhymes with Supersonic or something!

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.800
The movie was filmed in one night at UNM’s Center For the Arts.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.600
The first half of the movie looks really bad, because I captured it from VHS tape.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.380
The second half looks good, because I had split the movie into two halves to fit on a CD.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.280
I only ended up getting the second half though…

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.160
Paul McLaughlin is the first person to appear in the movie.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.980
He was just some random guy from class.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.060
I make a cameo in the movie.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.480
I’m the guy who exits the elevator facing the wrong way.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.580
I thought it would be weird that way.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.140
Will Belletto plays the role of “Khan, just Khan.”

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.080
He’s the captain of the ultimate frisbee team at UNM right now.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.780
I named the guy “Khan” because it’s a cool name.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.880
Like the guy from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan .

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.760
Cory Ponder plays the role of “Samantha Powers.”

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.220
This is a play on names: “Samuel Powers” is the real name of Saved By the Bell’s “Screech.”

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.020
Alex Hoffman played the role of “Dr. Pepper.”

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.520
He claimed to be a projectionist.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.620
He also claimed to have a girlfriend who was a stripper in Las Vegas.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.600
He disappeared after shooting, which probably means he went to Las Vegas to be with his girlfriend.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.940
Or not. Anyway, that’s the reason we have the dedication at the end of the movie.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.960
He didn’t really die.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.180
I don’t think.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.900
When Dr. Pepper says “bleepin’ mohawk,” it’s an in-joke from high school drama class.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.920
There was this guy with a mohawk, and we’d blame him for stuff.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.900
Like if it was raining that day. “Fucking mohawk!”

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.300
The bleep sound effect is actually Adobe Premiere’s countdown timer bleep.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.100
The music inside the elevator is “ Girl From Ipanema ,” which is usually used in media as the cliche “elevator music” song.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.100
The Six Flags ride that the characters mention that bears a striking resemblance to their situation is Freefall .

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.980
The music used in the “Twenty Minutes Later…” title card is Herb Alpert’s “Spanish Flea.”

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.480
This song was also used in that TV show, “The Dating Game.”

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.280
The original script called for Khan asking Samantha Powers for Tic Tacs, since he didn’t want to meet his maker with bad breath.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.940
I forgot to bring the Tic Tacs, though.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.840
Thus, the strangely inappropriately long shot of Khan using Chapstick.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.400
The shot of Khan pushing the button to open the elevator doors near the end of the movie was slowed down for dramatic impact.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:50.400
Khan puts on his sunglasses before opening the elevator doors (since hell is probably pretty bright and firey), but in the next shot, his glasses are off again. Oops.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.200
Khan and Samantha start saying “uh… sure” before Dr. Pepper even asks if he can get in!

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.140
They must be psychic.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.580
The music during the credits is once again “The Girl From Ipanema.”

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.000
This time, it’s an arrangement by Bobby Shew from his album, “ Heavyweights .”

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.700
Fun fact: I got my “shoe” autographed one time at a concert by Bobby Shew.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.920
Get it!? He really signed the bottom of it, but then it wore out because I walked on it too much…

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.880
People tell me the credits took too long to roll.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.360
Nicole Buckles was in our class.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.860
She helped provide sound effects, like the one of the screeching elevator. I think…
