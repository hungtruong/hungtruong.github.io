Dropbox Referrals with Google Adwords

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:06.854
Published on November 02, 2011.

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:14.886
I read a tweet from someone a while back about how they used Google Adwords to max out their Dropbox referral disk space.

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:18.743
I thought this was a clever hack and decided to try it for myself.

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:25.156
I made a new Adwords account and entered a coupon code from Dreamhost for $75 in free Adwords money.

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:29.433
I ran into a few issues with my first ads.

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:35.127
They were running okay in the beginning, but were getting shot down in the review process for trademark issues.

00:00:35.627 --> 00:00:43.379
I couldn’t figure out why this was the case, since I had seen multiple blog posts describing how to set up the ads with no mention of trademark issues.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.591
I tried a few tweaks, and removed “Mac” from the copy of my ads, thinking that the word might have triggered the trademark issue.

00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:58.224
The first set of ads without “Mac” in them ended up getting approved, and I was on the fast track to Dropbox space gluttony.

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:04.318
Here’s a screenshot of what my campaign looked like (until I stopped it because I maxed out on referrals):

00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:17.226
Things looked like smooth sailing and I think I only used something like $20 worth of credit (though I could’ve easily optimized for spend, I kinda wanted to finish more quickly, so I set my cpcs aggressively).

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:21.402
I was gonna change the ads and open it up for friends to get referral space, too.

00:01:22.402 --> 00:01:27.196
Then yesterday, with no warning, I got an email that my account had been suspended.

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:30.014
There wasn’t really any good explanation for this.

00:01:30.514 --> 00:01:32.511
When I look at my account, it says:

00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:42.462
Your Google AdWords account has been permanently suspended for repeated violation of AdWords or Landing Page and Site policies in this or a related account.

00:01:42.962 --> 00:01:50.554
and Your Google AdWords account has been permanently suspended because your billing information in this or a related account could not be verified.

00:01:51.554 --> 00:01:53.712
I’m not sure I could come up with a more vague message.

00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:58.447
So far, Google Adwords email support has been of no use at all.

00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:08.856
I first got an email saying they were “escalating” the matter, which probably just means they didn’t get around to it within 24 hours so they had to send something, then I got a generic form email saying that:

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:16.889
After reviewing your account, it has come to our attention that your Google AdWords accounts do not comply with our Terms and Conditions.

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:23.782
As a result, your account, and any related accounts you may have created, have been suspended, and your ads will no longer run on Google.

00:02:24.782 --> 00:02:27.259
Well no shit, that really doesn’t tell me anything new!

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.757
The best tidbit of the email was that:

00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:36.830
– For privacy reasons, AdWords Support is unable to provide any additional information regarding this account.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.465
You know, in case I find something out about myself that I didn’t know… It’s my account!

00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:46.981
If I did something wrong to get banned, I sure would like to know why.

00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:54.514
Since I don’t, I feel like I’m in the customer support limbo that is synonymous with “Google Support” which is already an oxymoron of sorts.

00:02:55.514 --> 00:03:05.903
Anyway, TL;DR I used Adwords to max out my Dropbox referrals like many have before, got the banhammer from Google and now their customer support is atrocious (as expected).
