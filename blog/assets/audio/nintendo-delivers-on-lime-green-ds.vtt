More than two years ago, I wrote a post about how I wished that Nintendo would release a lime green ds .

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:24.120
Strangely, this post has received a lot of notoriety on videogame sites since some people couldn’t understand that I just photoshopped a DS to look lime green and pined for a real one.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.580
At the time of this writing, that post is #1 on a Google search for “green ds” and probably a few other similar searches.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.600
Probably not for long, though.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.120
I just learned today that Nintendo really is releasing a lime green DS, but it’s in Europe only.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.220
Hopefully I’ll be able to find some way to snag a lime green DS.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.480
Maybe through ebay or something.
