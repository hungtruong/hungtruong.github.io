Openbook Reveals Less Than Facebook’s Own Search

A while ago, I found “ Openbook ,” a frontend to Facebook’s own search APIs that expose status updates from people who have them set to be public.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:23.138
The site’s purpose is basically to point out how much potentially embarrassing information is available, and how easy it is to find.

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:26.455
I thought this was a really clever idea.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:31.031
Then I realized that Openbook actually shows less than what Facebook does.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:36.086
I went over to Openbook and clicked on the query for “getting divorced.”

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:39.063
Then I ran the same search inside of Facebook.

00:00:39.563 --> 00:00:45.636
Openbook has the same results, but Facebook also includes replies and “likes” to the status messages.

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:52.769
In some cases it even shows comments from users who do not make their own status messages public (but replied to a public one).

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:59.902
I suppose that’s another thing that should be added to the list of “Things Facebook shares about you that’s not readily apparent.”

00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:03.299
Here’s the Openbook search I did:

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.818
And here’s the Facebook one:

00:01:06.818 --> 00:01:08.975
Way to one-up Openbook, Facebook!
