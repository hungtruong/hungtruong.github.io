Reviewme.com – Pay Per Reviews

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.420
Published on November 14, 2006.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.980
So something that’s hitting the blogging scene pretty hard is the notion of pay per reviews.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.200
Some sites are discrete, while others don’t require a blogger to say that they’re getting paid to write the review.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.160
Reviewme.com is a site that allows advertisers to contact bloggers for paid reviews.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.660
In fact, this is one of them!

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.600
Yes, I’m getting paid $20 to write this review.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.740
So is it biased? Perhaps.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.900
The good thing about ReviewMe is that they don’t require positive reviews.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.560
So bloggers aren’t forced to shill a website or product.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.060
Something tells me, however, that bloggers who give nothing but bad reviews will probably end up not being called back.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.960
It’ll probably end up being an unspoken rule that positive reviews are preferred.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.120
Another observation: if people are so desperate that they need to pay people to write about their product, the product probably can’t be that good.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.580
On my anime blog, I write reviews on stuff for free.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.720
Occasionally companies will send me stuff to review, which is good enough for me!

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.380
I can’t imagine a legitimate having to do more than that to get reviews.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.180
The bottom line: Will I keep using ReviewMe?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.640
Maybe, if anyone’s willing to pay for me to write about their stuff…
