Freakonomics – Book Report!

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:05.975
Published on May 18, 2009.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:11.050
I was first introduced to Freakonomics in my grad school stats class .

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.745
Part of the readings (don’t worry, we also had a textbook) included two chapters from the book.

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:24.197
I liked the chapters and eventually subscribed to the Freakonomics blog (which sadly only has excerpted stories in its RSS feed).

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:27.654
It’s been kind of overdue for me to finish reading the book.

00:00:28.154 --> 00:00:34.227
I finally checked it out from the library last month and finally had enough time (sick time) to finish it today.

00:00:35.227 --> 00:00:39.383
There have been a lot of reviews on this book, so I don’t think I need to go there.

00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:42.360
I’d rather just give my reactions to it.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.052
Basically, after reading the book, and assuming the work that’s done in the book is in the realm of economics, I’d really like to become an economist.

00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:57.345
Seriously. Do economists just sit around at universities all day and think about interesting answers to difficult questions?

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:00.002
I’m sure not all of them do.

00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:04.338
Maybe just a select few who are able to look at the world differently.

00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:09.334
Maybe it’s a stretch to try and relate my own field of study to the book’s.

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:18.704
Maybe not. In my former (I just graduated!) program, a lot of importance was given to contextual inquiry, incentive-centered design, user-centered design, etc.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:24.958
Basically, you can understand a problem better if you understand the context and the people who are experiencing it.

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:39.524
I’m actually surprised that there wasn’t formal game theory introduced into the book, though they did touch on that with the example of how a real estate agent’s time would be much better spent trying to get rid of a house than work a little harder for a much smaller commission (volume versus quality).

00:01:40.524 --> 00:01:45.718
I think that one of the overarching ideas of the book is that incentives drive the behavior of people.

00:01:46.218 --> 00:01:49.495
People cheat because it benefits them and they can get away with it.

00:01:49.995 --> 00:01:54.789
They don’t always do what’s best for them, though they might do what seems best given their situation.

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.123
The world is much more complicated than a few variables in a regression analysis (though it’s still a pretty useful tool!).

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:04.500
Also, correlation does not imply causation .

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:16.848
The book takes a strictly practical approach (“if morality represents an ideal world, then economics represents the actual world”), which is nice, if you can handle having some of your underlying beliefs questioned.

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:25.979
In fact, I think the main thing I learned from the book is to really question “common knowledge” and “popular opinion,” because it almost always seems to be informed more than just fact.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:35.450
I like that this book takes research (and a number of research methods like statistical analysis and surveys) and explains them in a intelligent and easy to understand way.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.304
It’s probably why my professor used it as part of the class readings (or maybe she just likes the book).

00:02:41.804 --> 00:02:51.714
It makes me yet again wish I had still applied for some PhD programs (though whenever I do, I again remember how crappy applying to grad school is and they sorta cancel out).

00:02:52.714 --> 00:03:01.744
I wonder if this book will have the effect that in twenty years or so, people who read this book and encouraged their kids to become economists will cause a huge uptick in economics degrees…
