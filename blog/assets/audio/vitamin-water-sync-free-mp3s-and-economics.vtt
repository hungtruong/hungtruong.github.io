Vitamin Water Sync: Free MP3s and Economics

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:07.253
Published on July 23, 2009.

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:10.731
I’ve become kind of a Vitamin Water fan.

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:18.423
Not because I think it’s actually healthy or anything (the second most common “vitamin” (ingredient) is sugar), but because I like the taste.

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:21.560
I’ve actually been drinking the stuff for like a year now.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.775
Anyway, I recently noticed (like a month ago) that there was a new flavor available called “Sync.”

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:36.865
The cool thing about this flavor is that it includes a code on the cap that you can redeem at AmazonMP3 (for some reason it says the music comes from MySpace) for a free song.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:44.637
By “a free song,” they really mean $1.29 of credit, since some songs cost that much, but others actually cost less.

00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:52.030
Because of this added value of this flavor (the other ones don’t have free songs), I’ve been kind of loading up on Sync.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.886
This also leads me to a semi-interesting economics problem.

00:00:56.386 --> 00:01:06.696
If I regularly bought MP3s from Amazon.com, I’d be doing myself a favor by getting $1.29 worth of “music” for ~$1, along with a free sugary, sorta-vitamin-y drink.

00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:12.630
This price difference was even greater when I went to Kroger and got 10 Vitamins-Water for $5!

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.367
But I don’t regularly buy music online.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:23.779
If I like an artist and want to support him/her/them, I’ll buy a CD, because then at least I have a physical representation of something that I can “own.”

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:25.477
Not just bits.

00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:28.454
But what about Sync versus other flavors?

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:34.468
While I like the other flavors (and variety is good), I’ve kind of been giving Sync an 8:2 split.

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:39.124
So for every ten Vitamin Waters I get, about eight of them are Sync.

00:01:39.624 --> 00:01:41.861
I mean, I like to have some kind of variety!

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:44.519
The Sync flavor is actually pretty good, too.

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:48.695
It’s probably just about equal with any other Vitamin Water flavor.

00:01:49.695 --> 00:01:55.209
One positive about the whole free music thing is that I’ve actually bought a lot of music.

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.026
Here’s what I’ve gotten thanks to glacéau:

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:00.704
Ingrid Michaelson – Maybe

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:02.823
Warsaw – Rude Girl

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.460
Jonathan Coulton – Joco Looks Back (Album)

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.017
Ingrid Michaelson – Turn to Stone

00:02:11.017 --> 00:02:13.814
Ingrid Michaelson – When the Leaves

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:16.732
Ingrid Michaelson – All Love

00:02:17.732 --> 00:02:26.043
I basically got a bunch of Ingrid Michaelson singles, a ska song I liked that I didn’t have on my computer and a Jonathan Coulton “best of” album.

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:29.100
All artists who I like and want to support.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:43.506
I mean, Jonathan Coulton kinda offers all of his music free anyway, so I saw this AmazonMP3 thing as a good way to send him some money (I also went to one of his concerts , which I assume helped support him (or maybe TicketMaster just pocketed it all!!!)).

00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:47.543
Sadly, my free ride is nearing its end.

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:51.159
The last time I went to Kroger, I bought some more Sync.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.015
When I got home and drank one, I realized the caps had changed.

00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:57.353
No more free songs!

00:02:57.853 --> 00:03:02.009
The wording on the bottle even changed to reflect the fact that there’s no song in there.

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:06.025
I assumed the flavor would have free songs forever, but apparently not.

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:11.559
I’ll keep an eye out for the bottles with songs, but I fear they will eventually dry out. Pun intended.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:21.270
The last economics question for this blog post: If Vitamin Water presents an extra incentive with the drink, then removes that incentive later, does it hurt its sales?

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.247
I used to buy the drink because I liked it.

00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:28.503
I may have replaced the reason for buying it with free songs.

00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:32.998
Now that there are no more free songs, will I continue to buy?

00:03:33.498 --> 00:03:37.014
Or will I feel robbed because I am now paying the same amount for less?
