00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:18.443
This weekend, I was in Gettysburg, PA visiting a pal.

00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:22.300
Besides enjoying history, there are many other things to do.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.195
One of these things is riding a Segway around the historic battlegrounds.

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:30.012
I guess that counts as enjoying history as well…

00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:36.366
Emily, Katie and I set up an appointment at SegTours of Gettysburg for a “Segway Experience.”

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.343
This did not include an actual tour.

00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:48.394
While we were getting ready for basic training, the lady asked us if we’d mind going on the real tour (she claimed she wanted to get more practice doing the tour).

00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:54.968
We were really happy to get a free upgrade since the reason for choosing the “experience” was to lessen the burden on our pocketbooks.

00:00:55.968 --> 00:01:01.082
Basic training consists of Segwaying around in a parking lot until you get the hang of it.

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:03.260
There are also cones involved.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.598
I got going pretty quickly.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:12.811
It probably has to do with the fact that I do Wii Fit a lot and thus am quite aware of my balance most of the time.

00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:18.186
The Segway accelerates backward and forward based on how much weight you put forward or backward.

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:23.400
Staying stationary is kind of a challenge as you must keep your balance completely in the center.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.457
The video above is of basic training.

00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:31.672
There was an older couple who also did the training but didn’t feel confident enough to go on the tour.

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:36.008
They were nice though; the older gentleman was smoking a pipe on his Segway.

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.284
The actual tour had us going through the Eastern battlefield.

00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:46.298
I must say, it was really fun going through alleyways and roads on the way to the actual battlefield.

00:01:46.798 --> 00:01:50.394
We also went through a hotel parking lot and passed a swimming pool.

00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:56.248
It’s really fun just effortlessly accelerating around while everyone else needs to walk up a hill.

00:01:56.748 --> 00:02:03.301
While the others complained about the Segway being a lot of work to ride, I thought it was pretty decent; just like standing.

00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.299
What did I learn on my tour?

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.317
That I want a Segway.

00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:15.290
I should really just get something more reasonable like a bike (which I think would provide the same kind of exhilaration, but with pedaling).

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.466
Segway-riding is really fun and I hope to do it again some time.

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:22.443
Oh, and history is also good, I guess.
