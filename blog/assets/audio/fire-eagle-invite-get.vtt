Thanks to LordElph , I got an invite to Yahoo’s newest thing, Fire Eagle.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.840
I feel as though there’s enough fire stuff in the world with Firefox and its eternal enemy, Firedog.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.380
But oh well.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.220
Fire Eagle is a centralized location information service, basically.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.320
You can use its built-in APIs to set user location information and grab user information from it (assuming you have the correct permissions).

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.360
This is cool because in the past, applications have had to do this location stuff on their own.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.020
For example, if I wanted to set up a Twitter clone that knew a user’s location, I’d have to be able to take the information and process it, and retrieve it later.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:58.040
Fire Eagle handles a lot of stuff like figuring out exactly where a user when things might be ambiguous (I typed in “University of Michigan” and it gave me a choice between the main campus and the Dearborn one).

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:08.000
I’m planning on coding up some location aware applications at some point soon, so I think it’ll be fun to try and see what I can do with the help of this Fire Eagle thing.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.140
Yahoo has definitely done something unique and I give them some props for working on this service!
