Let me tell you a little story.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:19.340
While on my drive back from the grocery store today, windshield down and blasting some “Of Montreal,” I overheard some sweet tunes coming from a truck during a red light.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:29.280
Instead of yelling at the driver for the name of the tune (he might not have known anyway), I turned off my radio, fired up this app, Shazam, and held it out the window for a few seconds.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.940
The app came back at me with the song title, artist, and other junk:

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.980
Pretty cool.
