00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:11.850
In a few days, I am going to SXSW with my company, Troubadour Mobile.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.708
It’ll be cool.

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:15.407
It’ll be awesome.

00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:17.425
I’ll miss lots of school.

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:23.859
Ever since I heard of SXSW, probably from Valleywag, I’ve wanted to go.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.475
There’ll be cool music, parties, swag, nerds, etc.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:28.934
I’m pretty stoked.

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:39.764
If you are also going to SXSW and you want to “follow” me (on the custom social network for conference attendees, my.sxsw.com, which is kinda cool), you can find me here .
