Prison Card Fight and Punishment!

00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:06.854
Published on May 25, 2009.

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:10.651
I had a dream that I was in prison for some reason.

00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:13.149
I guess the reason is irrelevant.

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.724
I imagine I was innocent and was unfairly accused of committing some crime.

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:26.775
Anyway, since weapons are not allowed in prison I decided I would carry a pack of playing cards around and I’d the use cards as some kind of shiv if I got into a tussle.

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:41.601
I think the idea originates from when I read about a book (I think this was in some kind of magician’s manual) that explained it was possible to get so proficient at throwing cards that one could, if thrown with enough velocity, lodge a playing card into a watermelon.

00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:44.578
I’m not sure if this is even really possible.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.355
I should look it up or ask it as a reference question to a librarian.

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:53.430
Okay, after a brief digression, I found the book: Cards as Weapons .

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.807
But apparently it’s just a hoax/parody. Oh well.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.245
Anyway, back to the dream.

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:08.056
As expected (think about Chekhov’s gun ), I eventually got into a major prison fight using cards (my opponent also used cards to fight back).

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:12.552
We actually fought with two cards in each hand, sort of knife style or something.

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:16.568
The prison guard broke up the fight and had to punish us.

00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:19.226
This is where the story gets interesting.

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:24.041
He used the face value of our cards to determine how severely to punish us!

00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:28.616
I have to hand it to my dream guard, he sure knows how to make things interesting.

00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:31.753
Is that just me complementing my own subconscious?

00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:33.452
I don’t know.

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:42.283
The guard was gonna add up the value of the cards we used as weapons and probably put us in “ the box ” for a duration of time appropriate to the value of the hand.

00:01:42.783 --> 00:01:46.459
Or something. In the middle of the guard figuring out the value, I woke up.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.078
Good timing, I think.
