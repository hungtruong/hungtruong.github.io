My American Idol Audition Experience!

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.540
Published on April 06, 2006.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.380
So I had this weird dream last night that I was auditioning for American Idol.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:21.960
I haven’t been watching the show this season, but I guess that it somehow seeped its way into my subconscious mind (actually, I think it’s probably because my friend Mark asked me if I was watching it).

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.320
I was in a group of about 30 or so people auditioning.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.940
First, we took a tour of the American Idol facilities (which I don’t really think exist).

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.480
They mainly consisted of empty rooms and hallways.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.820
It was sort of like a cross between Costco and a warehouse.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.900
After the tour, they split up the guys and the girls (just like in the show!) and the girls auditioned first.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.120
They all went into the audition room together.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.540
Whenever a girl would walk out of the room, you could hear music (it was sort of like a rock concert in there).

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.360
The guys’ turn came up, but unlike the girls, we had to go one by one.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.600
It was at this point that I realized I was auditioning for American Idol, and should probably figure out what I was going to sing.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.580
I wasn’t really thinking about it before.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.800
As my turn grew nearer and nearer, the only song I could think to sing was “Isn’t She Lovely?” by Stevie Wonder, but I didn’t want to do that because everyone sings that!

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.660
Plus I only know the first 6 words… I was also thinking of singing a weird Of Montreal song that would totally confuse the judges.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.780
My friends started calling me on my cell phone, and I was like, “not now, I have figure out what I’m gonna sing for my American Idol audition!”

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.120
They were excited, but I think they still just wanted to talk about their own stuff.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.360
Next thing I know, I’m at home reading my email, and my friend sends me a message saying that he saw my audition on American Idol.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.300
This is in the strange chronology of my narrative dream.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.200
I don’t remember actually auditioning, but I guess I did… Anyway, there’s a link in the email to the video clip!

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.180
Before I got a chance to click on it to watch myself audition (for the first time), I woke up.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.160
I guess I’ll never know whether I made it or not…
