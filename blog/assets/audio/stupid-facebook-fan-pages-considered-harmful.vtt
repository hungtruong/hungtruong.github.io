Stupid Facebook Fan Pages Considered Harmful

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:07.094

Yes, I’m breaking out the “ considered harmful ” cliche.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.247
I think Facebook is jumping a proverbial shark.

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:24.537
In addition to the “viral” quizzes that are really annoying (and occasionally interesting), the increase in random fan pages is really making the site hard to tolerate.

00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:27.914
Facebook wants to make fan pages like people.

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:32.170
That’s fine, if you’re only allowing people to have fan pages.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.465
The fan pages seem to have been designed for entities who want to have a presence on the site.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:40.762
Like companies or celebrities, etc.

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:47.675
Lately there have been fan pages for random shit like hugs, rain, flip flops, music, etc.

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:51.451
Who is supposed to be the owner of the rain fan page?

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.709
Who decides what rain says?

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:58.045
I think groups were a fine way of indicating that you supported something.

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:05.498
But fan pages are supposed to be pseudo-official (at least when celebrities make them, they are required to show proof of identity).

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:11.591
This mixture of official and random-shit fan pages just makes Facebook seem unprofessional.

00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:16.187
I am all for developing tools and letting people use them for what they may.

00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:23.880
But maybe there should be some rules about superfluous junk like fan pages for “wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tubeman.”

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.957
OR! Maybe I’m just getting old. *sigh*
