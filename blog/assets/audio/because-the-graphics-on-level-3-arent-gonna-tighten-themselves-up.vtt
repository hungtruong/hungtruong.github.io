Because The Graphics On Level 3 Aren’t Gonna Tighten Themselves Up…

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.660
Published on February 05, 2007.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:17.060
Back when I still had cable, and access to G4TechTV, which is now just G4, and considerably bad, there was this awesomely bad commercial.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.260
Two guys are playing video games when their boss walks in.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.520
Instead of yelling at the guys, she tells them she has another video game that needs designing!

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.180
Oh man, they’re video game designers!

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.280
And it’s their job!

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.700
They just finished level 3!

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.280
And they need to tighten up the graphics!

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.880
The commercial ends with the dude on the left saying that his mom said he’d never get anywhere playing video games.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.500
How wrong she was.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.100
The phone number for Westwook College Online is then presented with a caveat: Not intended for residents of Texas or Massachusetts.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.960
Obviously these states have banned video games altogether.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.660
Or perhaps they don’t recognize dead end online degree programs?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.360
Either way, it’s nice of the college to warn people ahead of time.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.300
Maybe they should also include, “Not intended for people eventually seeking a job of any kind.”
