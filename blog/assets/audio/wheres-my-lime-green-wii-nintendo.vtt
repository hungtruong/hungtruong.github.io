Where’s My Lime Green Wii, Nintendo!?

Today is the official launch of the Nintendo Wii .

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.560
Once again, Nintendo has defied logic and released a product that is not in lime green.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.460
I already had this discussion when discovering the official DS Lite colors .

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.540
If Nintendo wants me to buy a Wii, they must release it in lime green!

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.480
Okay, so I’ll probably end up buying one anyway (if I can get one).

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.340
I did get the white DS Lite, after all.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.640
If only Photoshop worked on real life objects…
