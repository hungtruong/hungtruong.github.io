Whilst at Digg, I found an article about how London and New York will be underwater by the year 2100.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.800
This reminded me of that show on Adult Swim, Sealab 2021.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:29.100
Then I started thinking about the words to the theme song, but I could only remember “at the bottom of the sea…” So then I looked up “Sealab 2021 theme” on google, and found the official Calamine website !

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.240
They’re the band that did the theme, and they offer a free MP3 of it for download!

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.500
Pretty cool how stream of consciousness web browsing works, huh?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.300
They’ve also got some other clips of their songs too.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.440
The singer has this cool sultry voice, and the music is in a new genre that they define as “Dreamy Pop.”

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.940
I especially like the song “ Trampoline ,” though I wish the clip was longer.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.040
They seem like a fairly indie band, so maybe I’ll buy their CD.
