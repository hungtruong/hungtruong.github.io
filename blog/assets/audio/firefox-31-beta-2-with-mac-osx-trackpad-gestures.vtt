Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 (With Mac OSX Trackpad Gestures!)

00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:09.491
Published on December 31, 2008.

00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:18.003
I’ve been using Firefox 3.1 b2 because it supports the three-finger gestures that are really useful on my new Macbook Pro.

00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:25.136
Friends have told me that Safari has the same support built in, but I argue that I need my Firefox plugins to survive.

00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:31.250
Ironically, most of the plugins I use for Firefox aren’t supported in this beta.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.426
So I’m pretty much stuck with the same functionality as Safari anyway!

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:42.159
Oh well, at least I can say I’m running something that’s a beta release, which should up my geek cred at least a smidge…
