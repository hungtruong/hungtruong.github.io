Pownce Beta Impressions Update: Uploads Work!

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.700
Published on July 19, 2007.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.820
Hmm. It looks like they fixed the uploads .

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.640
Oh, Leah Culver, when will you learn that hotswaps aren’t infallible …

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.040
So now Pownce is actually kinda neat.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:30.820
One issue I saw was that one of the MP3s I uploaded (umm, totally a song I wrote and performed myself…) played at like, .01x speed.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:41.240
Weird. Also, I had registered as a “friend” of some people, then removed the friendship (or fanship) and their messages still stayed on my page for a while. Oh well.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.640
Other than that, the site sure is slick.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.060
I can see this being a cool way to share neat music with people.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.800
It comes with its own mp3 player (which has some bugs), but so does gmail.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.180
I like the instant gratification feeling though.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.240
Aw hell, it’s fun to use, even if it isn’t a serious replacement for that thing I like to call “electronic mail.”
