Pharma Hacked!

00:00:02.938 --> 00:00:05.735
Published on June 21, 2012.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:11.130
I noticed that the Google results for my blog have been showing ads for pharmaceuticals.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.226
I am not actively trying to sell drugs, so I figured this was a hack.

00:00:16.226 --> 00:00:21.500
I ended up nuking the wp directory for this blog and re-installing plugins/images.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.312
I think the site’s clean now but it’s hard to tell since the “fetch as Googlebot” feature in Google Webmaster tools seems to show stale data.

00:00:30.812 --> 00:00:34.488
I’m not sure whether to blame Cloudflare, Google or myself.

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:39.643
Hopefully my Google results for this blog clear up in a few days or so.

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:43.419
The weird part of the hack is that normal visitors are not affected.

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:47.515
So the malware writers are apparently trying to sell stuff to Google.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:53.929
Of course, they’re just trying to raise their Google rank by inserting links and not being caught by being too obvious.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.543
But it’s interesting that the hack is transparent to normal people unless you check the Google cache.

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:03.660
Oh and sorry if you came here looking for the pharmaceuticals.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.557
You’ll just have to get them somewhere else.
