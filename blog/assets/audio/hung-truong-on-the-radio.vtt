Hung Truong on The Radio!

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:06.295
Published on August 13, 2010.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:10.251
A few months ago, when I was living in Seattle, I went with my .

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:13.468
gf and friend to a tour of Theo Chocolate .

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:18.603
It’s a chocolate factory about two blocks from where I used to live that does organic chocolate.

00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:24.377
On the day of our visit, a news reporter was doing a radio spot for NPR on the factory.

00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:27.994
She asked to follow us around and we told her that was cool.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:32.510
I looked for the spot for a while online, but I couldn’t find it.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.880
Just now, I was looking at searches on how people get to my website, and I found one misspelled query for “Hung Troung” that I followed and led to this blog post .

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.257
It’s the news report that I appeared in so long ago!

00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:50.413
I guess the lady didn’t have a lot to talk about because she used a lot of my random quotes.

00:00:50.913 --> 00:01:01.222
One of the funniest things that happened on the tour was this little kid (maybe 8 years old?) who kept on spewing non-sequiturs like “My uncle has a tree” and “I like pie” when asking questions.

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:04.279
He reminded us of the I Like Turtles kid .

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:07.895
I wish the reporter had gotten him in the story.

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:12.332
I also remember the tour guide being a little over the top.

00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:14.909
Like in terms of being dramatic and stuff.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.683
I remember hearing someone say that she just got back from doing some audition, so maybe that was why.

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:30.154
When the factory found out that the reporter had been following us around the whole tour, they felt sorry for us and got us some boxed confectionary candies.

00:01:30.654 --> 00:01:31.933
That was really nice.

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:36.029
I think they were like $20 each or something and we got one each.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:37.728
Score! Thanks, Theo!

00:01:38.728 --> 00:01:43.283
Oh, and I think it’s kind of apparent that I mumble a lot, or maybe I was just nervous.

00:01:43.783 --> 00:01:44.901
I should work on that.

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:51.155
Here’s the audio of the story and the transcription (Fair use?): [audio: HungTruongRadioTheo.mp3]

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:54.313
Remember Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:59.368
Where four lucky kids win a tour of Willy Wonkaâ€™s secretive candy plant?

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:04.263
Well, Theo Chocolate isnâ€™t that exclusiveâ€”but you better call ahead.

00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:09.318
Just one measure of its success; itâ€™s tours are booked solid.

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:14.053
Hung Truong: â€œMake sure you call ahead because the tourâ€™s so popular.

00:02:14.553 --> 00:02:17.829
I think I reserved like four weeks or something in advance?

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.007
Thatâ€™s really early.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:25.062
â€ Hung Truong came to Theo Chocolate to see where the candy he buys is born.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.679
Hung Truong: â€œOh wow the fig one is good.

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.775
â€ Kate Kraay, leads this tour of about 20 visitors.

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:36.871
Buzzing about each step of the chocolate barâ€™s creation.

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:47.360
Kate Kraay: It’s this process of slurping up the chocolate from the bottom, spraying it up and around the sides; this is the closest thing that we have to Willy Wonkaâ€™s waterfall of chocolate.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.456
How did a company just four years old navigate through the recession?

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:56.431
Vice President of Sales and Marketing Deb Music says one factor is the price.

00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:59.808
Theo bars run about $3 a piece.

00:03:00.308 --> 00:03:03.424
That’s proven to be not too high and not too low.

00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:10.078
Another ingredient to success is that Theo bills itself as the first organic, fair trade chocolate factory in the US.

00:03:10.578 --> 00:03:13.135
That plays especially well in the northwest.

00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:19.948
Music says founder Joe Whinney’s decision to relocate to Seattle from the east coast has been a golden ticket.

00:03:20.448 --> 00:03:31.557
Deb Music: â€œI think our values at this point are very progressive and in line with a lot of people’s values here and I think the company is inspiring because we’re really trying to effect positive change in the world.

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:37.011
â€ Music says overall the company grew by 21 percent last year, despite the rough economy.

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:44.544
And for the first part of this year Music says Theo has seen significant growth â€“ around 25 percent â€“ over 2009.

00:03:45.044 --> 00:03:48.959
Curtis Vreeland is a confection industry analyst from Pennsylvania.

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.414
He says while the chocolate industry isn’t recession proof, it is recession resistant.

00:03:54.914 --> 00:04:01.706
Curtis Vreeland: â€œThe overall premium chocolate market is struggling, but they’re layers in there which are doing well.

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:07.960
And those would be where Theo is and those companies that are sort of in the gourmet section, but not the high-end.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.816
â€ Another sweet spot for Theo is its identity.

00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:20.228
Curtis Vreeland: Once you’ve bought into the ethics of those kind of bars â€“ organic and fair trade â€“ you’re not going to shed your ethos in a recession.

00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:22.406
You may buy less.

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:27.381
I think when the country comes out of the recession they’ll be buying quite a bit more.

00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:33.155
Back at the tour at Theo Chocolate, Hung Truong says it’s worth the price.

00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:42.446
Hung Truong: There’s like a psychology thing there, where you might not be able to afford the best things all the time, but you can afford something that’s really nice some times.

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:45.423
And it’s just like what $3 for a bar?

00:04:45.923 --> 00:04:48.400
You’re treating yourself, and you’re not breaking the bank.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.097
By the end of the tour Truong is left with only one worry.

00:04:52.597 --> 00:04:55.394
Hung Truong: I think those little kids disappeared.

00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:58.770
It’s oddly like Charlie and the chocolate factory.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.348
Did one turn into a blueberry?

00:05:01.848 --> 00:05:02.807
What happened to them?

00:05:03.307 --> 00:05:05.544
I’m Chantal Anderson reporting.
