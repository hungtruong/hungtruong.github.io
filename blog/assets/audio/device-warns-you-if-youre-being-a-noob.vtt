Device Warns You If You’re Being A Noob

MIT Nerds are developing a device that can sense the emotions of those around you and detect whether or not you’re annoying them/being boring.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.120
Via the news link :

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:30.240
It will alert its autistic user if the person they are talking to starts showing signs of getting bored or annoyed… If the wearer seems to be failing to engage the person listening, the computer vibrates.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.440
Sure, it’s for autistic people, but I wouldn’t mind having one.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.300
I could set it onto ‘reverse.’ If anyone around me was boring or annoying, it would instantly administer a Danza Slap to the offending noob.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.300
For situations where slapping people myself would be inappropriate (mostly anywhere), this would be a godsend.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.440
I’d probably have to change the batteries pretty often, though…
