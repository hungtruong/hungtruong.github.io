00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:09.212
I have just learned that there is a Marmaduke movie .

00:00:09.712 --> 00:00:11.550
Apparently it involves talking dogs.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.564
Immediately I wondered if there would be a derivative movie: Joe Mathlete Explains Marmaduke The Movie.

00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:21.580
The tagline would probably be “ Marmaduke is an asshole .”

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.195
I guess the guy has known about this movie for a while and wrote a tl;dr essay about it.
