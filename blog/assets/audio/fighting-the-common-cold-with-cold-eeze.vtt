Fighting The Common Cold With Cold-Eeze!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.780
Published on March 30, 2006.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.820
On Sunday night, my throat felt somewhat congested, so I figured I was catching a cold.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.960
I wasn’t going to just accept it without a fight!

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.680
Cold-Eeze is like a cough drop, but it has some special Zinc ingredient in it.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.900
From my understanding, the Zinc coats your throat and prevents the cold virus from replicating.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.600
One note: the stuff tastes really gross, and it sort of stays in your mouth long after the lozenge is gone.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.700
Imagine eating the peel of a banana.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.080
Kick it down a notch and you have Cold-Eeze.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.240
Last time I had a cold, I tried using Cold-Eeze to decrease the length of it.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.100
I used it the late in day after I felt like I was getting sick, so I ended up being sick for more than a week.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.340
This time, I took it right away, even before I was sure that I was sick.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.120
Today, Thursday, I feel about as good as I did on Sunday.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.540
I’m definitely past the hump.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.080
In my experience, I’ve had colds that have been a lot worse (I didn’t really feel all that sick during the worst days, Tuesday and Wednesday) and they’ve lasted a lot longer too.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.560
I wouldn’t say that Cold-Eeze cures anything; it just makes your cold shorter and weaker.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.060
Even if you’re skeptical about it, I’d say it’s worth it to have some lying around so you can test it yourself if you’re starting to feel sick.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.980
Maybe it is a placebo, but hey, whatever makes you feel better, right?
