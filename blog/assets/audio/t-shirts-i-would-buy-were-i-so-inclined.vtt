T-Shirts I would buy, were I so inclined…

Monday is a really a mixed bag for me.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.160
On one hand, I have to go to school on Monday, after having a whole weekend to goof off do homework.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.900
On the other hand, Monday is the day that Threadless.com releases new T-Shirts!

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.640
Yep. This week, there’s only one T-Shirt I would buy, were I so inclined.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.300
It’s the Nerds Unite Shirt!

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:29.800
Being a nerd, I feel a special connection to the idea of nerds forming together to make a giant nerd-zord type thing to attack preppie jocks.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.700
Alas, I don’t think this shirt is awesome enough to warrant buying it.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.040
You, on the other hand, might.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.740
Check it out!
