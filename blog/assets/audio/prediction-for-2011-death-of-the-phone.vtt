Prediction for 2011: Death of the Phone

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:06.454
Published on January 02, 2011.

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:12.968
It’s January, which means it’s time for really misinformed predictions that will just look silly in hindsight!

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:26.895
I’ve been reluctant in the past to use Google Voice because of integration issues, but I think 2011 is the year that I’ll start relying on it more, especially if I end up changing my real phone number (I’ll just give out my Google Voice # and forward calls).

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:31.970
I recently bought an Android phone and was thinking of what I could use it for.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.665
With Google Voice and Skype, I could make “calls” and send text messages wherever I have an internet connection.

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:51.751
If Google eventually enables making voice calls over wifi (like in Google Chat, and I predict they will some time this year), I think the big phone companies will start hurting, because people will want data-only plans so that they can call with Google.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:59.943
This “cable cutting” has already happened with landlines (my Mom has a dedicated phone device that does VoIP) and cable tv.

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:04.838
So it makes sense that wireless phone providers will soon feel the effects as well.

00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:11.971
I’d really love to set up the HTC Hero that I ordered as a dedicated “landline” phone that I use with my internet connection at home.

00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:24.959
Of course, most people will still probably continue to use the standard bundled minutes + texts (+ data) phone plans, but I feel early adopters are just itching to pay one monthly data bill for all of their infrastructure needs.

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:29.614
It’ll only be a matter of time before the mainstream begins to head in that direction.

00:01:30.114 --> 00:01:41.623
I think that the phone as we know it (how ridiculous is it to pay a phone plan based on the number of minutes in the plan?) will begin to die in 2011, with more emphasis on bandwidth as the infrastructure requirement.
