Craigslist and Google Maps Mashup Thingy: Day 10 – Custom Controls and Housekeeping

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.740
Published on April 28, 2007.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.860
I guess this should count as the project’s 10th and 11th day, though I didn’t really spend too much time on either day, so let’s just roll them into one.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:26.120
After doing some CSS to overlay some divs over the Google Map, I found out there’s another way to do this: with “custom controls.”

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.600
The way that the custom controls work is both pretty sweet, and not that great.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.540
I don’t like having to add content to them by using javascript.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.000
It just doesn’t seem “correct” to do so, since I’m just overlaying normal html.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.100
So I’ll be using some custom controls, and some divs.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.400
The good thing about custom controls is that the map knows not to open infowindows under them when they’re opened up.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.200
Besides that, I just did a lot of random work on getting the app to look a little better.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.220
Like showing the correct area based on which city’s listing you want to see.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.080
Overall, the project is coming along really smoothly, with very few roadblocks.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.820
I’m happy that it’s nearing completion.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:25.400
I really enjoy doing these one-man projects, since it lets me get experience in everything from database schema planning and optimizing, to php backend development, to designing the css for the content, and even maybe a little tweaking in the Apache server.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.020
I think once I add this project to my “real” server, I’ll need to get a ram upgrade.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.940
I think the project should probably be ready to go live within a week.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.280
I dunno if I’ll actually try to get the word out, or just release it and see if people find it via Google or something.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.580
That’d be cool.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.160
Since there’s already a site that does a similar thing (though there’s a smaller number of supported cities), I don’t think what I’m doing is really that noteworthy.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.740
I think it’d be useful, though, so we’ll see if there’s any reaction at all to it.
