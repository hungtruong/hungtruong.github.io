Note to Myself about UISplitViewController and Auto-Rotation

In order to prevent my future self from wasting like, 2 hours fucking around with UISplitViewController getting it to auto-rotate its subviews, here’s a little post!

00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:25.796
Most of the time, UISplitViewController doesn’t want to rotate because you didn’t set it as the root subview of the Window.

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:32.849
This is pretty well documented on StackOverflow, etc. I thought this was why my splitviewblahblahblah wasn’t rotating.

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:36.865
It turns out that, according to Apple’s documentation,

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:43.619
A split view controller relies on its two view controllers to determine whether interface orientation changes should be made.

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:49.393
If one or both of the view controllers do not support the new orientation, no change is made.

00:00:49.893 --> 00:00:54.208
This is true even in portrait mode, where the first view controller is not displayed.

00:00:54.708 --> 00:01:02.460
Therefore, you must override the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method for both view controllers and return YES for all supported orientations.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:12.650
The key here is that the view controller wasn’t autorotating because the subviews did not answer “YES!!!” (exclamation points added by me) to shouldAutoRotateToInterfaceOrientation.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.224
I was fucking around with the Split View Controller in Interface Builder (and later programmatically) to no avail.

00:01:19.724 --> 00:01:25.957
Adding the stupid autorotate thing to yes in the subviews made it work (shouldn’t it default to YES!?!??!).

00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:28.235
Okay, lesson learned.

00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:30.973
Just don’t forget this next time, Hung!
