Recipe: Potato Broccoli Tofu Stir Fry! (PoBroccoFu Delight)

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:08.452
Published on June 22, 2009.

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:10.331
I cook sometimes.

00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.587
It’s pretty fun and my food actually turns out pretty delicious sometimes.

00:00:15.087 --> 00:00:19.083
Today I made a new dish which I will call “PoBroccoFu Delight.”

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:24.857
It’s the second time I used potatoes in a stir fry environment and the first time I successfully did so.

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:29.533
I figured I’d write down the recipe so I can remember what the heck I did.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.731
Ingredients:

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.569
1 medium-sized potato

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:39.485
1 pack of broccoli (there were three stalks in it)

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:43.441
1 tofu carton, firm

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:45.720
some random onions

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.638
a little bit of garlic salt

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:54.113
some chopped garlic (from a thing of garlic lover’s hummus that was too garlicky)

00:00:55.113 --> 00:00:56.871
some “flavoring” that my mom gave me

00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:59.869
some “vegetarian stir-fry” sauce

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:05.504
The first thing I did was cut the tofu into ~1cm thick slices and fry it.

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:11.118
While this was happening I also washed the potato and then chopped it into bite-sized pieces.

00:01:11.618 --> 00:01:16.013
It’s good to parallelize your cooking because it makes the process go much faster.

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:22.267
Just don’t forget to start the rice cooking like I did or else you’ll have to wait on it to finish before eating.

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:27.961
I didn’t peel the potato because the skin tastes kinda good and it has a nice texture.

00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:32.297
The reason I wanted to use potato is because I had it previously at No Thai!

00:01:32.797 --> 00:01:37.511
(which is unfortunately not vegetarian) and I like the potato in stir fry motif.

00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:43.786
After the tofu was done frying, I set it aside and threw some more oil and the chopped potatoes in.

00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:47.962
The oil kinda flew around a lot, which I do not like.

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:51.099
It got the kitchen floor all oily and slippery.

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.434
Anyway, I left the potatoes in there to fry a bit and turned them occasionally.

00:01:55.934 --> 00:02:00.170
Then I got to work cutting the broccoli into just the head parts (florets?).

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.745
The potatoes need more time to get cooked, so it’s a good idea to cook them first.

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:10.679
I didn’t realize this the last time I used potatoes and got fairly uncooked potatoes in my stir fry.

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:16.293
Gross. The time it took to cut the broccoli was just about enough to let the potatoes cook.

00:02:16.793 --> 00:02:25.025
I also chopped some of the tofu (about half of it; I kept the other slices for maybe fried rice later or a quesadilla) as well.

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:34.576
I put some garlic salt on the potatoes and then remembered that I had a bunch of garlic from a package of Garlic Lover’s Hummus that I spooned out of the hummus.

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:36.834
Too much garlic is gross.

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:41.649
I had it set aside and I figured I’d just throw it in (garlic is good).

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.226
Then I threw the broccoli and tofu in.

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:54.157
I also added some of the random flavoring seasoning stuff my mom gave me a while back (I always joke that it’s MSG, but I think it’s really some kind of mushroom-based flavoring).

00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:59.052
I also used the rest of the “Vegetarian Stir Fry Sauce” that I got from the Asian grocery.

00:02:59.552 --> 00:03:02.508
I just realized this post is really unscientific.

00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:05.486
Oh well; it still turned out well.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:13.758
I added some onions (because really, why not?) and then added some sesame oil in addition to the other olive oil that I always use for cooking.

00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:17.774
I stirred the contents around for a while (hence, stir fry).

00:03:18.274 --> 00:03:21.630
I was a bit worried it would be too “dry” but it turned out fine.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.765
I would’ve probably added some water or more of that stir fry sauce but I ran out.

00:03:27.265 --> 00:03:28.943
I figured it’d be okay.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:35.617
The broccoli has a really nice natural flavor when it’s cooked, and the potatoes add a nice texture when they’re fried.

00:03:36.117 --> 00:03:38.195
They also absorb a lot of flavor.

00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:42.850
The tofu also absorbs lots of flavor and works as the protein of the dish.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.108
I think that’s about it.

00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:50.323
Despite the fact that I didn’t put a whole lot of effort or thought into the meal, it tasted really good!

00:03:50.823 --> 00:03:53.859
Hopefully I can make it again and reproduce the results:
