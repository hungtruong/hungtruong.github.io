Pianica GET! A Stunning Rendition of Oh Susannah!

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.820
Published on January 17, 2008.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.980
Here’s a post that, for some reason, I kept in my queued posts and never published.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.880
Until now!!! I think I did this some time during the Summer.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.260
As you can see, it takes place before I moved to Ann Arbor!

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.960
And here we go:

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.480
I got a Pianica!

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.980
If you’re wondering what a pianica is, it’s like a melodica, except when Yamaha makes it they call it a pianica.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.880
More specifically, it’s sort of like this cross between an accordion and a harmonica, where you just get a keyboard and you need to blow into it to get the reeds moving.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.460
It’s “famous” for being in that manga, Nodame Cantabile, which I totally like, which is mostly why I bought it.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.980
I practiced a bit today, but I really suck at keyboard.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.760
I never really bothered learning how to play, but I do read music, so that’s how I was able to BS my way through Oh Susannah:

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.080
Not very good, but this take was funny because I put a seven chord at the end.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.820
I actually like Oh Susannah a lot.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.560
The words make no sense.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.100
The reason I didn’t play any left hand at the end is because I found some free sheet music online, but they only showed the first page! GRRRR.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.700
I think I’ll keep practicing and become the Pianica champion of the world!

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.440
Or play music on the street for money.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.100
Either way it should be interesting.
