I wrote this over on my grad school blog, since it has to do with grad school.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.740
I got an offer to be a University Library Associate.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.280
This is a pretty big deal, so read about it here !

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.360
Basically, tuition and money to go to school are no longer a concern, and I’ll be sending my acceptance to Michigan very soon.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.680

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.700
Now I’m super happy!
