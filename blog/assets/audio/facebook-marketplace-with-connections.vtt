Facebook Marketplace – With Connections!

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.020
Published on May 14, 2007.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.420
So the Facebook Marketplace is like this mini craigslist for the various networks in Facebook.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.680
This is pretty neat.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.900
Not because you can sell stuff on Facebook, necessarily, but because it incorporates the existing data of Facebook as well.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.020
When you look at an item, you get information on the item and seller, and also information regarding your “relationship” with the seller.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.720
So if the seller is your friend, Facebook tells you.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.700
Well, you should already know who your friends are… But if this person is a friend of a friend, Facebook tells you that as well!

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.820
This is really cool (and something craigslist lacks) because you automatically have a way to determine if the seller is legit, without using lame feedback methods like Ebay does.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.680
At least, hypothetically, your friends should know legit people…

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.120
It’ll be interesting to see how successful the marketplace will be.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.620
While it may be fun getting random stuff from strangers with craigslist, it’d seem like a better idea to actually know who that couch belonged to before using it…

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:17.660
Also, I think it’s hilarious that Facebook decided to release this like a day after Oodle launched a sponsored group featuring its own classified ads. PWNED!
