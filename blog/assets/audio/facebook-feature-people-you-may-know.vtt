Facebook Feature: People You May Know

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.140

Might as well be called something like, “People you befriended then removed because they were jerks” or “People you know but aren’t friends with” or “Jerks who are friends with many of your friends.”

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.540
The algorithm is probably pretty simple.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.520
Facebook probably just grabs people who are not your friends but share a large number of friends with you.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.580
I imagine they aren’t doing any kind of interesting (mathwise) stuff like weighing friends with low degree higher and friends with high degree lower.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.360
That would mean that friends who are friend whores count less toward your “People you might know” score than friends who have very few friends.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.400
And that’s why Facebook needs employees well versed in network analysis and graph exploration!

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.400
*HINT HINT*

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.560
Also, I’d really like to see a “DO NOT WANT” button for the douchebags who keep on showing up in my list of people I may know.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.980
Just because I may know them doesn’t mean I want to be “friends” with them, FB.
