Internship Searching Season 2008

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.940
Published on January 06, 2008.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.500
So January (and in some ways, December) is the time to start looking for internships.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.320
I’ve already done quite a bit of looking along with sprucing up my portfolio site (the projects section has accordion effects now!) and updating my resume.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:40.880
I think part of the reason it’s difficult to search for internships is because I’d like to define the internship rather than the employer defining it for me. I understand the need to succinctly say, here’s what the internship position is, but too often I end up seeing generic “software engineering” of which I have no idea what they entail.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.420
Hey, maybe some potential companies are looking at my blog!

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.560
Then I can define what I’m looking for in an internship and they can contact me if they agree!

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.380
But part of the problem is that I’m also unsure of what I’m looking for in an internship.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.920
Okay, perhaps a lengthy blog post will fix that.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
I’m originally a classically trained Computer Scientist.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.980
That’s what my B.S. is in, and that’s what I can do on paper.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.240
So I should qualify for all of these generic Software Engineering positions.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.060
Going into grad school, I’ve been under the impression that maybe there is something more interesting than vanilla software engineering.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.960
Of course, my knowledge of “vanilla software engineering” is not really based on facts of any kind.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.740
I did some freelance software engineering work for a company over the Summer, but I don’t think that’s indicative of any typical SE work.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.520
Actually, it’s probably generally false to assume that there exists a typical software engineering job.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.700
Maybe I’m oversimplifying.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.640
Anyway, let’s move along.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.760
So far, I’ve been happy with my grad school experience.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.540
There are a lot of ideas floating around, a lot of real research being done, and smart people all around.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.680
I’ve done a project in my Networks class that could theoretically be considered research, and I find it interesting to just investigate things for the sole purpose of learning stuff.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.800
My question is, what should I look for in an internship?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.480
Of course I want to learn something.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.220
Do I want to get a research internship?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.920
Would a software engineering internship betray the academic lifestyle I’ve so enjoyed?

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.420
Am I being an internship snob?

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.340
This is what’s going on in my head.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.160
Let’s take a brief interlude by checking out the internships I think are totally awesome, and why I think they’re awesome!

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.280
Not surprisingly, Google is on the top of my list for their internships.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.700
One reason is that their recruiting is second to none, seriously.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.760
Just look at Google’s internship page (which is fairly simple to find from their homepage) and compare it to Yahoo’s… oh wait, they don’t have an internship page to speak of.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.060
The Yahoo one just tells you to type “intern” in their way bad job search engine…

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.100
Okay, so onto the Google internships.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.680
The single internship I want most is “Associate Product Manager Intern.”

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.660
Tangent: I was at the Google info session last year and talked to someone about opportunities for someone who was an engineer but has become slightly “more.”

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.960
Again, I don’t want to sound like a snob or anything, I’m just talking about additional education.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.740
The Google guy told me I might want to apply as a PM.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.760
Apparently, Product Manager is an entry level position.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.740
I always thought that Software Engineers were promoted to PM status after working for a while.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.080
Anyway, the description leads me to believe that this is right up my alley:

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:40.640
The area: Product Management Google’s Product Management group leads the processes that enable our company to bring innovative, world-changing products to market.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.020
Our team works closely with Engineering to help design and develop technologies that improve access to the world’s information.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.320
We’re responsible for analyzing user needs and guiding our products throughout the execution cycle.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:01.500
Our team offers a range of opportunities for candidates with less than two years of job experience who desire breadth and variety in their job responsibilities.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.480
The role: Associate Product Manager Intern As an Associate Product Manager Intern, you’ll work with engineers to define new features for existing products based on your understanding of user needs.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:23.620
You’ll also conduct research on markets and our competitors, focus on strategies that impact the direction of future products and develop leadership experience in a variety of Google’s product areas.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:32.760
Associate Product Manager Interns are given important responsibilities, generous access to resources and many opportunities to learn about other areas the organization.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.780
Technical, analytical and strategic planning skills are vital to performing successfully in this position.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.880
Responsibilities: Understanding and analyzing user needs.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.260
Helping to define a product vision and strategy.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.520
Working with world-class engineers to build and launch new features.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.580
Requirements: Currently pursuing a BA/BS in Computer Science or related field, and graduating in 2009.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.960
Excellent written and oral communications skills.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.260
Strong organizational and analytical skills.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.680
Strong technical abilities.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.860
Demonstrated capacity for developing and understanding strategy.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.800
Deep interest in creating and analyzing products.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.160
At this point, I think this position is about as close to my ideal internship as any will get.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.020
I really enjoy coming up with new products and applications.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.560
I like designing and building them, and analyzing them!

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.100
It seems like it would balance creativity and practice pretty well.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.700
Do any other companies take interns for PM positions?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.800
It still seems a bit strange to me, not that I would complain if I got it…

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.440
Google also has an internship for Software Engineering Statistician Intern.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:54.460
I think the requirements for that one are maybe a bit out of reach for me (I’m taking a stats course this semester) but it seems interesting.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.020
As far as other prospects go, I was already shot down for a Facebook Internship , but that one was in Software Engineering.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.120
There is a full time position for “Data Insights” that seems interesting.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.740
I want to apply for it and ask if they’ll take me as an intern.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:17:06.020
Another interesting “make mine an internship” internship could be the Research Analyst position on Digg’s job page.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.840
I’ve read that companies aren’t as averse to internship-ifying jobs as one might think.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:16.140
It shows I have the proactivity to get things done, right? Right!?

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.140
There are a few research labs that I was thinking of applying to as well.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:27.080
PARC, IBM, Microsoft, Yahoo (if they ever get any posts up).

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.980
All of those labs have some group that is interested in social computing in one way or another.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:40.320
Yahoo is actually especially interesting because their labs have access data to Yahoo properties like Flickr, Delicious and Yahoo 360.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.160
And those are just about all the places that I have considered so far.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:56.620
I think at this point, it is difficult for me to find an “appropriate” internship because there haven’t been any graduates from the University of Michigan School of Information with the specialization in Social Computing yet.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.200
It’s new from last semester!

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:06.760
Anyway, if you have any good suggestions, please leave a comment, or you can use my contact form that’s on my about page , too!
