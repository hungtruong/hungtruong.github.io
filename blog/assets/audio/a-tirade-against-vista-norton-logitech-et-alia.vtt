A Tirade Against Vista, Norton, Logitech, Et Alia

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.540
Published on December 19, 2007.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.740
I got my mom a new Inspiron 531S from Dell, and I’m setting it up right now.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.680
Okay, actually, I just sorta got the computer when I bought my 24-inch monitor, and my mom needed a computer, so I brought it over.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.760
It has Windows Vista installed.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:36.180
I haven’t really ever used Vista, but I’ve been bombarded with frustration since roughtly 8:30am, so enjoy my stream of consciousness tirade while I get my mom’s computer working the way it should!

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.060
Vista: Get your act together, man!

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.920
You know the first thing that happened after my mom created her admin account?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.500
“Windows Explorer is not responding, do you want to [end process] [wait] [uninstall Vista].”

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.880
I would’ve chosen the tertiary, if it had existed.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.800
Dell: What’s up with all this crap pre-installed on my system?

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.860
I don’t want Google Toolbar or Google Desktop!

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.280
I don’t want random Dell crap using my resources, I don’t want…

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.560
Norton Internet Security: WTF!?

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.780
You’ll protect my mom’s computer for 30 days?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.720
And then stop protecting it?

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.020
This seriously amounts to some kind of extortion.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.320
And why does it take 10 years to finally uninstall all of you!? And…

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.840
Vista: Why do you need my permission to do anything and everything!?

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.900
Would you like my permission to change contexts?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.920
Load up the kernel?

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.580
Reference and dereference memory?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.720
Because I could hit “okay” all day if you wanted me to.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.580
Okay, I’ve disabled this in the control panel.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.560
Yet I needed to restart to get it to work.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.980
Though when I restarted, Vista decided to install a bunch of security updates without asking me first.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.960
Hey, Vista, don’t assume I have all day to wait for you to install these security holes that you shouldn’t have shipped with in the first place!

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.180
Oh man, I’m getting angry… At least it didn’t just restart randomly, like my own desktop has been doing lately (I disabled that, too).

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.380
Okay, so now stuff is sort of working properly.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.720
Except that Vista is actually slower than XP was before.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.780
Or maybe it’s this AMD chip that’s somehow found its way into my mom’s computer.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.680
(Full disclosure, my mom works at Intel).

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.320
Well, now to install some drivers, like the…

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.280
LOGITECH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE DRIVERS: WHY THE FUCK DO YOU TAKE UP 53.1MB!?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.900
SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU A MULTIMEDIA EXTRAVAGANZA!?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.480
AND NO, I DON’T WANT TO INSTALL YAHOO TOOLBAR!!!

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.920
To be continued…
