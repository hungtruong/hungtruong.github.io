Cool Shwag From Jlist: Final Fantasy XII Potion, Question Mark Box Bank, Sound Effect Capsule Toy, Busted Pocari Sweat!

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.060
Published on March 27, 2006.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.420
So today I got my package from Jlist containing all of the sweet nerd stuff that I’ve been waiting for!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:32.360
I got the Final Fantasy XII Potion (4 of them), a Question Mark Box Bank (with character inside), a sound effect Capsule Toy, and a busted pouch of Pocari Sweat (I didn’t ask for it to be busted).

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.440
First, the Final Fantasy Potion:

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.240
Yes, that’s my hand in the picture.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.700
Maybe I should be a hand model… Anyway, the bottles were a bit smaller than I envisioned.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.760
I’m going to be drinking the potion along with my cousin, who ordered 2 with me. I was thinking of doing a video review or something.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.620
I’ve heard it tastes like medicine, but I think I’m getting a slight cold, so maybe the potion will cure it!

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.260
Next, the Question Mark Box Bank:

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.980
Yep, it’s a bank shaped like the box in Mario that you hit to make a coin or whatever appear.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.920
I tried punching it.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.180
It just made my hand hurt.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.960
I envisioned it would be bigger than it actually turned out to be.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.780
It can probably hold like, $1 worth of change. Yay.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.660
It also came with a keychain character.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.280
I got a blooper.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.020
He came in a little protective baggie.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.160
I like it.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.800
Next up, the other Sound-Making Keychain!

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.040
There are six of these keychains in all, but I ordered one and got a random one.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.700
It makes the Mario swimming sound.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.000
It’s a lot bigger than I thought it would be, and I dunno if I should walk around with it as a keychain.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.900
It could go off in my pants without warning!

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.120
Check out my quick demo video of it in action!

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.560
Last but not least (well, probably both) is the Busted Pouch of Pocari Sweat (try saying that five times fast!):

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.680
I’m going to ask Jlist if they’ll send me an unbusted one.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.980
It sort of got all over the other stuff and made it look like I got some cocaine with my order.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.760
True, there’s still some mix in the pouch, but now that it’s open, I dunno if I wanna ingest it.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.940
For all I know, it IS cocaine!!!

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.540
EDIT: Jlist wrote back saying that they’d send me a replacement.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.160
How cool are they!?

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.360
So yeah. That’s it.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.660
If you wanna be cool like me and get crazy stuff from Japan, check out Jlist .

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.840
They’ve got some neat stuff.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.220
Shipping is kind of a lot, but if you buy in bulk, it becomes somewhat reasonable.
