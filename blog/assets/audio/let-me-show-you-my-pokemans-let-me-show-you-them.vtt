Let Me Show You My Pokemans. Let Me Show You Them.

I guess this random image has been around for a while, but I just saw it recently.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.520
I guess its resurgence in popularity has to do with the recent release of the new Pokemon Pearl and Pokemon Diamond games for the Nintendo DS.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.920
I am a big fan of the cat macro images, and this one is just pure awesome.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.820
I guess the combination of cats in strange poses and bad grammar (“let me show you them!?”) is a comedy goldmine.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.860
Oh, that reminds me, I really should buy those new Pokemon games.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.360
I know I’ll get them eventually, so it might as well be sooner than later.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.100
It’s not like they’d drop in price or anything…

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.540
Also, the ytmnd page of this poster has some awesome live arrangement of the Pokemon battle song.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.240
It’s sooo bad!

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.060
I’m getting way too pumped listening to this.
