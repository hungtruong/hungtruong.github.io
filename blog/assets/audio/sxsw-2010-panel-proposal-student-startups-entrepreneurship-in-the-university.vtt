SXSW 2010 Panel Proposal: Student Startups! Entrepreneurship in the University

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:09.651
Published on August 20, 2009.

00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:14.487
I have once again proposed a panel for SXSW 2010.

00:00:14.987 --> 00:00:19.062
Last year’s didn’t get picked, but I have a good feeling about this one.

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:24.117
I don’t see any other panel ideas that are too similar to it and I think it’s a neat idea.

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:31.650
Basically I’ll get a bunch of student entrepreneurs and have them talk about the challenges and opportunities of doing startups while still in school.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.145
I know a few other entrepreneurs and I’m trying to enlist the help of others.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.004
Here’s the proposal:

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:46.835
Description: While student startups are not a new phenomenon, universities and venture capitalists are beginning to see the advantages in supporting them.

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:56.206
Join a panel of student entrepreneurs in a discussion on finding funding, incorporating a company and balancing homework, work and life, all while attending school full-time.

00:00:56.706 --> 00:01:02.939
Questions answered during the panel: How are universities starting to support student entreprenurship?

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.074
What are the legal implications of using university resources for personal business?

00:01:08.574 --> 00:01:13.129
(copyright) How can I “double-dip” schoolwork and startup work into the same project?

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:18.663
What kinds of venture capital support are available specifically for student startup businesses?

00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:22.919
Into which type of corporate structure should a student startup incorporate?

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:26.695
How much money do I need to get started as a student entreprenur?

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:29.673
How can I get my classmates to provide free labor?

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:34.248
What should I look out for when accepting work from non-company students?

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:40.342
(ownership rights) How does one achieve a healthy work/homework/life balance as a student entrepreneur?

00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:43.958
What happens when I (and my partners) graduate?

00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.874
So far, my pal Ben Congleton has said he’ll be on the panel.

00:01:49.374 --> 00:01:52.011
Now to find a bunch of other panelists!

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:57.306
You can also help by voting for my panel (I should have mentioned this first) here !
