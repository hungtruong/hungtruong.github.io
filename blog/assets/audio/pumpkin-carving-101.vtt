Pumpkin Carving 101

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.460
Published on October 31, 2006.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.660
Today is Halloween.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.560
UNM had a special pumpkin carving contest going on in the SUB.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.420
Since I had 2 hours to kill, me and Wei (some guy from my CS class) went to carve a pumpkin.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.560
Wei picked a way too big pumpkin and we started.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.280
But there was a lack of tools.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.500
Apparently the blades kept on breaking off of the handles for the carving tools.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.640
I went into MacGyver mode and made a custom shiv out of one of the blades and a napkin.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.980
It worked okay, but it also made my hands really tired.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.660
Anyway, it took like, 20 minutes to get the top off of the damn thing.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.400
Then it took a few more minutes to scrape all of the crap from the inside out.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.980
Once we finished doing that, they announced that all participants had 5 minutes to finish their pumpkins…

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.820
We ended up just trying to finish, but we both had class to go to.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.400
I took the pumpkin home and finished it there.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.940
Here’s the result!

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.820
It’s really badly proportioned, since the pumpkin is huge and the face is tiny.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.240
I do like, however, having a pattern of an actual jack-o-lantern on a jack-o-lantern.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.340
It’s kind of meta, don’t you think?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.900
Next time I’ll do a jack-o-lantern of a jack-o-lantern with a jack-o-lantern inside of that one!

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.440
And so on.
