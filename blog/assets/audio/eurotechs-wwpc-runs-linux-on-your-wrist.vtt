Eurotech’s WWPC Runs Linux on Your Wrist!

Eurotech’s WWPC wristwatch runs a Linux desktop environment!

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.400
I’ve got a Fossil Abacus that runs Palm OS, but this watch seems to blow it away!

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.780
From the article:

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:29.700
According to Eurotech, the WWPC integrates everything users expect of a PC, in a versatile, ergonomic form factor that supports a variety of wrist sizes.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:38.760
It can be worn over or under work clothes, and has flexible left- or right-handed straps that enclose dual 2-cell Li-polymer rechargable batteries.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.340
Claimed battery life is six hours in “fully operational” mode, or eight hours under normal circumstances.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.980
It actually seems a bit hefty for a wristwatch, but so does my Abacus.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.360
I’d still wear it!

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.300
What with the whole six hour battery life thing, I’m thinking this isn’t meant for use as a watch, but a computer that you wear while you’re using it.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.940
While I’m waiting for this to hit the market, I guess I could always just duct tape my Dell Axim to my forearm…
