Via Kotaku , I discovered what seems to be the biggest stash of nerd-centric video game paraphernalia this side of the Pacific!

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.440
Galbadia Hotel has it all: MP3s, MIDI, Sheet Music, Artbooks, even freaking commercials!

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.020
And some are really old and cool!

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.600
I was going to go somewhere for Spring Break, but it appears I’ll be plastered to my computer downloading MP3s and whatnot.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.780
I always wanted to know how to play “Suteki da Ne” on the piano…

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.700
If you don’t believe me that they have everything: They have the freakin’ Ducktales (NES) Original Soundtrack!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.040
Don’t tell me you weren’t looking for that!

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.640
Now, if I had to guess the legality of this awesome site, I’d have to say it’s entirely illegal!

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.380
But I’m not hosting this crap, they are!

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.200
So for now, enjoy the wonders of Galbadia Hotel and all they offer.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.500
You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Nor will you ever want to.
