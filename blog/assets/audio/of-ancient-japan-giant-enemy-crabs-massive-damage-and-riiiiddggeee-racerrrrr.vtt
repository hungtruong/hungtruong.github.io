This is probably kinda late, but I wanted to point out this video.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.600
It’s the Sony E3 Press Conference in 1 minute:

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.520
My absolute favorite part is where the guy is talking about how Genji 2 is based on actual historical facts.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.380
Being based in history, the game also has battles that actually took place in ancient Japan.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.400
Then he starts talking about “Giant Enemy Crabs” and causing “Massive Damage!” by attacking their weak point. Priceless!

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.640
There’s also Kaz Hirai who, by being a bit too excited for Ridge Racer, has become an internet celebrity!

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.220
Oh, and he also announces the giant price of the PS3.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.700
Speaking of Ridge Racer, I just got a PSP and I’ve been playing Ridge Racer.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.440
It’s pretty fun, but I need some more games.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.300
Anyone have suggestions?
