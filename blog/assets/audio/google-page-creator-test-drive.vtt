So I tried out the super-hip Google Page Creator that everyone’s talking about.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.240
I don’t think it’s that super awesome.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.860
For one thing, the templates are kinda rigid.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:28.240
I suppose they’re good for really simple web pages, but after using css and php and all that snazzy stuff, I’m not impressed by Google’s offering.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.100
They only offer 100MB of space, too.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.480
Didn’t geocities offer more like, 10 years ago?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.920
Anyway, in order to increase my web presence (in an effort to control the world), I made Hung Truong: The Google Page ! Enjoy.
