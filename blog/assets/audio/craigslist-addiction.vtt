Craigslist: Addiction!

00:00:03.338 --> 00:00:05.975
Published on August 21, 2009.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:11.290
I have had some experience with craigslist before, but never selling stuff.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.788
I just looked at some apartments.

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:19.322
But since I’m moving and I need to get rid of stuff, I listed a few things on craigslist to sell.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:24.318
One girl contacted me about my coffee table almost immediately after I listed it.

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:28.494
Her roommate picked it up and he told me she’s kind of a hawk on craigslist.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:32.989
Many people contacted me about stuff and never replied after I replied to them.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.247
Some people just didn’t show up.

00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:38.624
Lots of people are bad about calling before showing up.

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:42.161
Actually, no one so far has called before showing up.

00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.097
This is bad, because what if the thing already sold?

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:56.607
The most interesting thing about craigslist interactions is that they consist of two parties who don’t really trust each other, except that they recognize they’re both just normal humans who are probably okay.

00:00:57.107 --> 00:00:59.584
There’s a lot of implicit trust set in.

00:01:00.584 --> 00:01:05.459
Like, for example, the dude who picked up my table left his wallet in my apartment for some reason.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.596
Maybe that’s like a form of escrow.

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:12.452
Then he paid me after the entire table was ready to be driven away.

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:18.226
The person who took my couch paid me upfront, before I helped her husband move the couch into their truck.

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:23.201
Either way is fine, I guess, if you believe that people are inherently trustworthy.

00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:30.334
Or at least trustworthy enough to not drive away with your table if you go back into your apartment to get him some tape to hold down the drawers.

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:35.709
Also, it would be much easier to just steal from people than set up an elaborate craigslist scam.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.985
I wonder if anyone has done research on the psychology of craigslist.

00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:47.517
There’s certainly a lot of risk/reward built into the system, along with not knowing people, whether they’re trustworthy, etc.

00:01:48.017 --> 00:01:52.812
There’s also just a mad adrenaline rush when you get a wad of money and someone takes your couch for you!

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:58.906
I have a few more things to get rid of, so hopefully the rest of my transactions go as well as my previous ones!
