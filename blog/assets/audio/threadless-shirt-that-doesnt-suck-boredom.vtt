Threadless Shirt That Doesn’t Suck! Boredom.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.100
Published on July 09, 2007.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.460
Threadless has been on a sort of non-roll of sorts.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.760
Or maybe you could call it a roll of sucking.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.460
Anyhow, this week they’ve got a shirt that doesn’t suck!

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.040
It’s one of a genie in a lamp.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.220
Being bored as hell .

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.300
I actually feel bad for genies.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.080
Being locked away inside of a small lamp, released for maybe once every thousand years.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.460
Then having to give wishes to stupid people.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.360
Plus that TV is outright ancient!

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.680
Perhaps it’s not the actual content of the shirt that I like, more than the colors.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.780
Maize and Blue?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.160
Hmmm, perhaps a certain university is brainwashing me.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.620
Ah well, anyway, this is a “definite buy if a $10 sale was going on” shirt.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.840
For $15… I dunno. Maybe.
