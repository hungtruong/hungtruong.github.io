blink – Malcolm Gladwell: Book Report!

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:06.934
Published on June 18, 2009.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.651
I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction books lately.

00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:16.425
A lot has been written about Malcolm Gladwell’s books so I figured I’d grab a bunch from the library.

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:19.003
I just finished reading “ blink .”

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:22.459
I haven’t read The Tipping Point or Outliers just yet.

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:25.277
Anyway, I thought I’d write a quick review.

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:34.428
Blink tells the story of our subconscious (Gladwell uses “unconscious” which kinda bugs me) brain’s ability to make split-second decisions.

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:44.838
Basically, he argues that we’ve evolved to “thin-slice” certain experiences (recognizing when a fake statue just doesn’t look right or hearing a singer who turns out to be a natural).

00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:52.050
That ability can be used in other contexts if we could just determine the important variables and block out everything else.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.685
Gladwell is a really good writer; his stories are interesting and they flow well.

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:03.699
Unfortunately, the actual substance feels like it lacks the scientific rigor that I’m used to.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.111
For example, he has a chapter on the aforementioned thin-slicing – only taking in the important elements of a situation and deciding based on those.

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:17.965
Later, he discounts thin-slicing because it leads to us stereotyping entire ethnicities and cultures.

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:27.495
He gives an example where music executives hear a singer who they know is a natural hit (and cites Fred Durst as an expert, which makes me throw up in my mouth a little).

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:33.110
Unfortunately the executives fail when it turns out that actual listeners don’t like the artist.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.523
Another story is about a wargame that the army set up where the advanced system succumbed to paralysis by analysis.

00:01:40.023 --> 00:01:45.617
It was a really weak example of thin-slicing and had very little to do with the theory he described earlier.

00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:48.754
I think he just wrote that chapter to fill up the book.

00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:55.668
The book is full of inconsistencies and it seems like Gladwell is trying to tie everything into a cohesive theory.

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:58.805
The thing is he fails at it pretty horribly.

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:04.339
What we end up with is a bunch of nice stories and no overarching theory of anything.

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:06.278
They’re just stories.

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:08.296
Are they interesting?

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:12.632
Yeah, but they contradict each other and end up making the book weaker in its narrative.

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:21.463
As a counter-example, Duncan Watts has a way of writing interesting stories and linking them all together in Six Degress (how appropriate).

00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:27.557
Also fun to note is that I believe there’s some kind of nerd feud going on between Watts and Gladwell .

00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:33.891
I tend to believe Duncan Watts because he’s a super badass and has numbers to back up his theories.

00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:38.567
I dunno if I’ll read any additional Gladwell books at this point.

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:43.462
I’ll probably try some other authors first and go back if I run out of other stuff to read.
