Anime Nano iPhone App For Sale! (Free)

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:07.893
Published on April 26, 2010.

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:13.767
My first iPhone application has been approved and is “ready for sale” in the Apple App Store!

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:18.982
I decided to do a native version of Anime Nano , which already has a mobile site .

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:23.158
This native one loads faster and also doesn’t have ads (yet).

00:00:23.658 --> 00:00:25.656
Get Anime Nano for iPhone!

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:31.291
If you install it and play around, you’ll notice it’s really simple and lacks features.

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:32.909
This is on purpose.

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:41.561
Instead of spending a lot of time getting it perfect and including all features of the full website, I figured that I would release the most simple functioning app first.

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:47.415
I read a bunch of Rework before having to return it (I borrowed a digital copy from a library).

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:56.146
Rework basically suggested that software be light and easy to use, and I think Anime Nano for iPhone fits well within that mentality.

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:59.863
I plan on iterating on Anime Nano to improve it.

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:08.754
I think enabling an iPad version would be the next logical step, as well as including things like the personalized blog list and series, and search.

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:16.547
Anyway, if you have an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, please download Anime Nano (for free) and let me know what you think!
