00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.820
Published on March 22, 2008.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.260
Well, it didn’t take long for Rick Astley to get out of my head.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.440
While on shuffle, my iTunes played the Bob Mintzer version of “My Foolish Heart” sung by Kurt Elling.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.300
It’s really a nice ballad.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.360
And the arrangement by Mintzer is nice and slightly weird as is his style.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.040
The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart!

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.380
How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart!

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.240
There’s a line between love and fascination, That’s hard to see on an evening such as this, For they give the very same sensation.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.060
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.840
Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.620
But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.240
For this time it isn’t fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart, It’s love, this time it’s love, my foolish heart!

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.880
And, as usual when I get a standard stuck in my head, it’s really friggin’ stuck in my head!
