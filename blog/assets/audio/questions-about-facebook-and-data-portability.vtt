Questions About Facebook And Data Portability

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.295
Published on April 21, 2010.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:12.729
Something that is usually on my mind, either in the forefront or the back of it, is data portability.

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:28.893
I like “owning” the data that I create, whether it’s from a tweet or a Facebook status message, or even more mundane like the bit of knowledge via a Last.fm scrobble that I listened to Dexter Gordon’s Wave at 3:27am on August 16, 2007 (I’m thinking this is in GMT?).

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:32.510
The point is that data that I create is my property.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.481
I would go as far as to say that the online interactions I have, like friends’ activity that I comment on and interact with, is also my property.

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:47.175
For example, a friend’s status message that I reply to and that ends up being a long thread.

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:50.732
Some services make gathering my data easy.

00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:55.867
Twitter has a dead simple API and so does Last.fm.

00:00:56.367 --> 00:01:03.400
I’ve been toying around with gathering location data from Twitter, embedded in photos I take on my phone, and other sources.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.694
One website that still confuses me a bit with regards to their policies is Facebook.

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:15.768
About two years ago, there was a semi-large fuss made over Facebook joining a Data Portability organization.

00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:19.784
Apparently it was sort of a me-too move to copy MySpace .

00:01:20.284 --> 00:01:26.277
Since then, there’s been a Stream API created and you can actually grab stuff from your “activity stream” from Facebook.

00:01:27.277 --> 00:01:30.713
The thing is, the rules are super vague and contradict each other.

00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:34.809
For example, the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities states that

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:43.081
You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings .

00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:51.034
This makes it seem like I have the right to collect that content and information that I create, since I “own” it and have control over it.

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:53.931
Yet the Developer Policy states:

00:01:54.931 --> 00:02:08.837
Storing and Using Data You Receive From Us You must not store or cache any data you receive from us for more than 24 hours unless doing so is permitted by the offline exception , or that data is explicitly designated as Storable Data .

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:14.612
You must not give data you receive from us to any third party, including ad networks.

00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:26.140
You must not use user data you receive from us or collect through running an ad, including information you derive from your targeting criteria, for any purpose off of Facebook, without user consent.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.671
Unless authorized by us, your ads must not display user data – such as users’ names or profile photos – whether that data was obtained from us or otherwise.

00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:46.960
You cannot convert user data you receive from us into Independent Data (e.g., by pre-filling user information with data obtained from the API and then asking the user to save the data).

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:56.810
Before making use of user data that may be protected by intellectual property rights (e.g., photos, videos), you must obtain permission from those who provided that data to us.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:07.139
You must not give your secret key to another party, unless that party is an agent acting on your behalf as an operator of your application, but you must never give your secret key to an ad network.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.115
You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account identifiers.

00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:17.749
This basically says that I have to delete any information gathered within 24 hours.

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:23.284
Facebook is making the assumption here that users are not developers and vice versa.

00:03:23.784 --> 00:03:27.620
I’m not interested in gathering other users’ data; I just want my own.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.916
And yet here are two conflicting statements.

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:35.273
I’ve already used the Facebook Stream API in the past to collect my data.

00:03:35.773 --> 00:03:40.408
While the policy states this is not allowed, it’s basically unenforceable.

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:46.981
What bothers me a bit is that it is against policy for me gather my own data using Facebook APIs.

00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:53.474
Twitter allows this, and even goes a step beyond by suggesting that developers cache data to improve performance.

00:03:53.974 --> 00:04:02.605
To their credit, Google has a “Data Liberation Front” whose purpose is to keep an eye on products and keep data import/export for users as a priority.

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:09.279
I see data portability as a big issue while considering the natural lifecycle of a social networking website.

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:17.051
As I use Facebook less and less, I still want to have a connection with those who are on it, and I want to maintain a record of what happened.

00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:23.864
I hate to think that while I “own” this data, I have no right to access it, especially if I decide to leave the service.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:30.778
I started writing this post before realizing that Facebook’s annual f8 conference is actually going on today!

00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:36.712
I guess I can look towards today’s news to see if anything has been announced re: data portability.

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:40.109
EDIT: Well that was fast!

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:44.205
I guess they removed the 24 hour limit thing during the keynote today.

00:04:44.705 --> 00:04:49.500
What this means directly to data portability is still up in the air, though.
