Nacho Libre: Movie Review

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.820
Published on May 13, 2008.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.740
I borrowed and watched the Jack Black movie from a few years ago, Nacho Libre , last night.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.160
I’m not a huge fan of Jack Black but I guess I do find him generally funny.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.740
I figured this movie would be pretty good since the Napoleon Dynamite guy directed it and Jack Black stars in it.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.500
I have to agree with Ebert .

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.920
The movie just isn’t that great.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.260
Or rather, it doesn’t reach the potential that it obviously has.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.360
There are so many untied loose ends that at the end of the movie, I was really sure there had to be more.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.240
What about the skinny guy’s relationship with the fat woman?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.020
What about the skinny guy’s love of science, and not God?

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.400
Wasn’t Nacho supposed to convert him or something?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:58.980
And wasn’t Nacho going to get married to the hot nun (who I thought was Penelope Cruz through the entire movie but is apparently a different actress)?

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.020
None of the characters were really fleshed out that well.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.160
The hot nun was just sort of a token hot nun who just looked confused for most of the movie.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.940
The skinny dude sort of became a companion to Nacho, but his character really didn’t go anywhere either.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.500
I think part of the problem is that you lose a lot of Jack Black’s funniness when he has to use a fake Mexican accent.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.560
Instead of talking like Jack Black, he just does a lame impression of a Mexican dude.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.500
It’s like they put really heavy ankle weights on Jack Black’s comedy ankles and they never took them off!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.880
Except maybe for the scene where he sang.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.580
That was pretty funny.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.300
Also, the movie was a “Nickelodeon” production, which explained the lack of cruder humor and the abundance of fart noises.
