I don’t mean to be such a Threadless.com whore, but this is for a good cause.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.160
Threadless is selling a shirt for Hurricane Katrina Relief for $10, and donating $20 for each shirt.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.500
So basically, you get a decent shirt and double your donation of $10!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.400
This shirt went on sale yesterday and all of the girl ones are already sold out.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.260
Luckily, fat men who are feeling charitable still have a chance.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.080
Yes Weller, I mean you (and me).
