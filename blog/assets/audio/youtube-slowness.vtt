For the past few days, Youtube has been weirdly slow.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.960
I don’t think it’s my internet connection, because my home and work locations both result in lots of buffering in Youtube videos.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.580
Considering that Google owns them (literally), it seems like they should have all the bandwidth they need.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.720
Yet almost every video I try to watch ends up timing out and rebuffering.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.780
Maybe people should make more of this crisis than the whole “Twitter is always down” thing.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.700
Because people actually use Youtube!
