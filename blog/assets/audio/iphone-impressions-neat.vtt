iPhone Impressions: Neat!

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.300
Published on June 30, 2007.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.940
So I drove on over to the Apple Store today (it was on the way back from some other place I was driving to) and I tried out the iPhone.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.880
It’s neat! I tried out all the applications and they work fairly well.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:27.100
The typing is alright, but when you type words that are uncommon in the dictionary, for instance, “truong,” the keyboard kinda compensates in the wrong direction.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.500
Besides that, the applications are pretty fun to use, but they seem a bit more jerky than the commercials would have you believe.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.720
For instance, I was using the google maps app and it took forever to download the map tiles!

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.060
The zooming in and out using the multi touch was way cool, but it also seemed to lag behind a bit as well.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.560
I know it’ll take lag to move stuff around, but it was… how should I put it?

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.740
Slower than I expected.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.900
The iPhone certainly is a cool gadget.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.560
I just don’t know why it needs to be a phone.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.180
Apple’s created a pretty sweet PDA that includes a phone, which requires a subscription fee.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.000
If they had just called it the iPDA, maybe I’d be more willing to get one.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.100
That, and if they lowered the price, made it snappier, made the battery life longer, etc. I actually had one die while I was using it in the store.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.480
The battery ran out and I had to switch to another one.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.800
Oh well, maybe in the next generation/iteration I’ll be able to afford one.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.420
And convince myself that I should pay the price for it.
