Banana Republic (and Gap, etc.) Stores Passwords in Plain Text

I was sitting on the subway when I got a random email from Banana Republic that contained my password in plain text.

00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:27.694
Besides the fact that I hadn’t requested it (lots of Hung Truongs think that they’re me @ gmail), I was surprised because any company that even slightly values security does not store passwords in plain text.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:32.349
It is quite jarring to see a password show up on my iPhone’s home screen.

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:35.326
Here’s the email in case anyone needs proof:

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:46.236
The fact that BR stores passwords in plain text means that they’re probably a very nice target for a quick hack (and if they’ve got bad practices in password storage, they probably have holes elsewhere as well).

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:58.004
Unlike the Gawker password leak, which had hashed passwords (though they could still be eventually brute-forced), the BR passwords aren’t even obfuscated (or if they are, it’s in an easily reversible way).

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:14.189
If you have a Banana Republic, Gap, Old Navy, Piperlime or Athela account, I highly suggest you change your password to something unique that you don’t use for any other sites (um, just like all your passwords… I totally have different passwords and two-factor security for everything).

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.224
I’d also suggest you contact Banana Republic and tell them that their security policies suck.

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:23.361
Maybe they’ll fix it if enough people complain.

00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:28.096
That’d be sad if it took a huge hack and user info disclosure to change their ways.
