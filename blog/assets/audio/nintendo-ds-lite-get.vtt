Nintendo DS Lite Get!

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.180
So I got my Nintendo DS Lite in the mail today.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.360
My first impressions?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.580
It’s hot! Comparing the screens of my original DS and the DS Lite is insane.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.520
The original Nintendo DS backlighting wasn’t bad, but the Lite makes it look like it’s lit by candle!

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.100
They should rename it the “DS Light!”

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.980
Other impressions: It’s smaller (duh).

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.040
It also started hurting my hands when I was playing.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.260
Maybe this is because I haven’t played video games in a while, or maybe it’s because the DS Lite is too small. I dunno.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.340
I’m gonna sell the original DS to my brother, but I better not let him see the DS Lite until he goes through with the transaction.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.560
Otherwise he might just buy a DS Lite himself!
