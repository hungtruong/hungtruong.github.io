Found Audio: An Intro

00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:12.489
While rummaging through my old room, I found an old cassette voice recorder thing.

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:17.544
Sort of like the thing that the kid in Home Alone uses to make a hotel reservation.

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:20.281
Except it was for actual voice recording.

00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:23.738
I used it a bit in high school for various purposes.

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:29.832
The tape that was left in the recorder was recorded somewhere between my sophomore and senior years in high school.

00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:33.528
I’d probably say it was later, either junior or senior year.

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:41.800
The stuff on the tape is a pretty eclectic mix (I haven’t listened to everything yet) of music and recorded conversations.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.255
I’m thinking of recording bits and pieces and maybe making it into a mini-podcast series.

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:54.228
It’ll be pretty esoteric; I have a feeling no one but me and a few of my high school friends will actually find it interesting.

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:57.285
But so is a lot of the content on my blog anyway!

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:01.621
Once I get home I’ll start digitizing and organizing the stuff on the tape.

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:04.998
I wish I could find the many other tapes of stuff.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.495
They’re probably sitting in my room somewhere…
