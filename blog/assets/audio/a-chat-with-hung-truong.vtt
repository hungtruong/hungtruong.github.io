I use Olark (formerly Hab.la) on my portfolio site.

00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:13.628
It’s a widget thing that lets you chat with your visitors.

00:00:14.128 --> 00:00:16.845
My friend Ben invented it, so check it out.

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:20.722
Anyway, some guy just started chatting with me on it.

00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:23.539
He was also named Hung Truong.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.436
