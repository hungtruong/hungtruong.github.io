Flu: The Shot

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.020
Published on October 28, 2008.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.300
I forgot to write about this, but I got a flu shot last Friday.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:19.480
Now, the flu shot is a prophylactic (site note: I am impressed with myself for spelling that word correctly WITHOUT a dictionary or any other spelling aid) against future sickness.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.500
But did you know it can sorta make you sick!? It can.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.300
Apparently the process of makin’ antibodies can give you the side effect of fever and also making your arm (the one that is shot) sore.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.080
I was pretty much out of commission with a huge headache and general blah feeling on Friday evening.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.240
I was thinking about the flu shot.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.420
It doesn’t contain all of the flu strains; just the ones that “scientists” think will be around during flu season.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.200
So these “scientists” just pray that the flu strains they picked will be the ones that people will be inoculated with.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.040
This kinda doesn’t make sense to me.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:03.780
If a large portion of the population is immune against many different types of flu, wouldn’t that make less competition for a strain that isn’t in the flu shot to take control?

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.560
It’s basically like giving one flu the monopoly on humans.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.180
I’m not sure it works that way, but it seems to make sense.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.960
I suppose there’s very few strains of flu so that makes it less likely that one flu would take over.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.100
Plus tons of people don’t get the shot anyway.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.120
I’m not an epidemiologist or anything, so don’t take my word for it!

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.080
Either way, I hope I don’t get knocked on my ass by the flu like last year!
