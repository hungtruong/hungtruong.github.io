Filezilla: Update Whore

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.220

I actually like Filezilla as a good, free open source FTP client.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.720
But man, does it whore for upgrades!

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.580
It seems like every single time I open the program, it’s got some kind of upgrade it wants to download.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.380
Seriously, Filezilla is an FTP client.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.680
FTP is just a file transfer protocol (whoa, that’s what FTP stands for!).

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.860
As far as I know, FTP really hasn’t changed much in the past few years.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.680
Oh, sure, we’ve got SFTP and FTP over SSL and stuff, but c’mon, how often do you really need to update the core software for FTP!?

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.800
What’s that? There’s a way to turn off automatic updates?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.860
Okay. But I can’t stand not having the latest version of any software!

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.640
What’s a nerd to do?

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.560
Also, Filezilla: I don’t need to be told to send all bug reports to you every time I update the software.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.660
I got that the first time…
