Businesshackers Dot Com: Redefining “Lame”

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.020
Published on May 11, 2007.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.460
So I got this spammy email in my inbox and I thought it was too good not to write about on my blog.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.440
I got this “offer” via Notecentric , my social note taking web app.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:29.040
Dear friends, here is Dario, the founder of “businesshackers.com, profitable ideas for business and life”… I am writing to tell you that I was really impressed going through your website.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.700
My team and me have seen thousands of websites and start-ups in particular and rarely have we seen such a good work.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:45.880
One of the things we try to do is to promote great website that do not receive any promotion because of a number of reasons such as lack of funds, not enough time to launch it, etc.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.100
We usually charge quiet a lot of money for reviews and links to websites due to the quality of posts you can find on businesshackers.com.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.760
We focus on quality, not quantity.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.700
There is something we can offer you: you can write a review of your website, but please try to be as objective as possible.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.600
What you could include is a description of why the site was created, how it works, what your plans are, etc.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.020
You are allowed to include max 2 links to your site and 1 picture.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.920
It should be a good way to gain visibility online.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.860
Normally we charge between 30 and 160$ for a review, but because of the quality of your website we will be happy to publish your own text on businesshackers.com.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.360
Please let me know if you think it is a good idea.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.140
Best regards, Dario p.s. if you prefer us to write the review for you it is just 50$.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.400
This is the link with the details.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.100
p.p.s. please link to businesshackers.com if possible p.p.s. we do not accept duplicate content, only unique sorry

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.820
Basically, they’re offering to post a review of Notecentric, given that I write it and send it to them… OR I can pay them “just” $50 to write it for me.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.800
Screw that. Judging from the quality of the writing in their email, I wouldn’t take money from them to write about Notecentric!

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.480
Do all the companies on this lame ass website pay for these reviews?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.940
If so, I think the word needs to get out about this totally lame and unjournalistic enterprise.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.580
BTW, I’m intentionally not linking to them, lest I contribute to their pagerank.
