Final Fantasy XII Potion! Only $12.50 a Pop!

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.020
Published on February 27, 2006.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.540
NCSX.com is taking preorders for the “highly limited” (only 3 million units) Final Fantasy XII Potion drink!

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.680
It’s only $12.50 per bottle!

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.180
Hey, whatever happened to the standard 300 gp retail price?

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.800
Now, if it was somehow reasonably priced, I’d totally grab a few just in case I ever got critically hurt.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.460
It would have to be a huge emergency for a $12.50 potion, though!

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.100
This comic makes a lot more sense now too.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.760
It pretty much describes my behavior during all the Final Fantasy games.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.620
Why use a phoenix down when a mage can use life?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.280
The mage is dead?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.740
Oh, I guess we have a catch-22 on our hands.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.720
I’m still not using that phoenix down, though.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.340
Don’t even get me started on the subject of Elixir hoarding…

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.540
I also used to calculate the cost efficiency of using an ether on a mage to cast healing spells, rather than buying potions to heal.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:21.840
Then I’d calculate which healing spell (cure1 vs cure2 vs cure3) would be most MP cost efficient (because casting cure3 on a guy that only needs like, 300 hp is just stupid).

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.500
Seriously, that’s how big of a nerd I was.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.780
Anyway, getting back on track, anyone wanna split a case of Final Fantasy XII potion with me?

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.260
Update: Play-Asia.com has the premium potion in stock for $12.90, though I think shipping is cheaper.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.980
If you wanna go the cheap route, go with Jlist.com.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.680
They have the regular bottle for $4.50 .

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.460
That’s the one I went with.
