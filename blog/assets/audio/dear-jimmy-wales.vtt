Stop begging for money and just put some ads on Wikipedia.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.960
Maybe do some random sampling so you don’t get ads all the time.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.740
Maybe only do ads on certain topics that won’t piss people off.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.120
But c’mon, the begging for money is annoying and doesn’t seem to be working anyway…
