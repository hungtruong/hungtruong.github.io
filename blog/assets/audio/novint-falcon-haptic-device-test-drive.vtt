Novint Falcon: Haptic Device Test Drive!

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.140
Published on January 31, 2006.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:17.540
Today in my Computer Game Development class, someone from Novint (a local company specializing in haptic devices) showed a demo of the Novint Falcon .

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.560
What’s a haptic device?

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.060
It’s sort of like a game controller that can provide feedback in all directions.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.760
There were some texture demos, and a few games like launch the duck, where you grab a duck in a slingshot, pull it back, and let go.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.360
The cool thing is you can feel opposing force when you pull the duck back.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.540
It doesn’t feel quite perfect yet, but I believe it’s still in development.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.960
It was still really fun moving this device around (the one we used didn’t have a pen, it was more like a door knob), and feeling it respond.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.360
I have a feeling that this device will end up being a novelty, unless it sees huge support from every developer in the world.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.420
Sure, it can be used for other stuff like medical simulations, but in the field of video games, I’m not too sure it’ll take off.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.760
Here’s the official company line:

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:15.080
The Novint Falcon, which is designed to retail for under $100, is the only consumer device to provide three-dimensional, high fidelity force feedback.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:25.100
Unlike any consumer force feedback product on the market, the Novint Falcon enables users to move right and left, forward and backwards, like they do with other devices, plus up and down.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.520
Users can now experience a full range of realistic touch sensations including shape, texture, weight and dynamics.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.700
The Novint Falcon connects to a PC through a USB port and its footprint is approximately 9”x 9”, comparable to a mousepad and most joysticks or peripherals.
