Fun New Apple Products: Intel Mac Mini, iPod Hi-Fi, and Leather iPod Case

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.620
Published on February 28, 2006.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.340
Today Apple had a “Fun new products” event.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.880
I think everyone was expecting a cool new video touch screen iPod gadget.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.180
Instead, what we get is kind of boring…

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.620
Intel Mac Mini

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.080
First off, there’s now an official Intel Mac Mini.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.580
I’ve been meaning to get a Mac, so now that there’s an Intel Mac, I can not feel guilty about buying one.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.560
(Disclaimer: My mom works at Intel).

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.420
The entry model starts at $599.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.000
It’s still kind of expensive, so maybe I’ll wait ‘til I strike it rich.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.440
iPod Hi-Fi

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.100
The new iPod is… not an iPod.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.960
Bummer. The iPod hi-fi is just an overpriced jukebox that you can stick your iPod on.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.540
iYawn. It seems that Apple is tired of letting all the third-party manufacturers profit from the iPod, so now they’re making overpriced accessories as well.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.320
The iPod hi-fi costs $349.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.160
iPod Leather Case

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.140
Speaking of overpriced accessories, check out iPod Leather Case!

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.520
Only $99! If this is a “fun new product” for Apple, I’m not impressed.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.020
It doesn’t even provide access to anything while the iPod is in the case!

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.460
So there you have it, Apple’s fun new products.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.040
I may get an Intel Mac Mini (I wonder if my mom can get a discount), but the others just plain suck!
