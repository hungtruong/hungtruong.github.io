Jazz Song Currently Stuck In My Head: Stella By Starlight

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.700
Published on November 25, 2007.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.780
So currently, I’ve got Stella By Starlight stuck in my head.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.680
It’s mostly the Chet Baker version that appears on “ The Best of Chet Baker Plays .”

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.180
I’ve got a few other versions that are pretty good, like the Bill Evans one .

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.900
My friend David always likes to point out how bad the words for this song are.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.480
They really are probably the worst lyrics to a jazz standard ever:

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.240
The song a robin sings, Through years of endless springs, The murmur of a brook at evening tides.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.300
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.880
That great symphonic theme, That’s Stella by starlight, And not a dream, My heart and I agree, She’s everything on this earth to me.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.040
Does anyone know what a song that a robin sings through years of endless springs sounds like?

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.900
Or a murmur of a brook rippling though a nook?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.760
And Stella by starlight is a vision, not a sound, right?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.460
Couldn’t we say something about Stella herself, rather than babble endlessly about stupid rhymes (brook and nook make me stabby)?

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.340
If you can look past the shitty lyrics, the melody is really nice.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.400
Plus this song has the distinction of having some unique changes that I can’t really say sound like any other song.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.660
Off the top of my head, at least.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.760
The tune works well uptempo or as a ballad, too.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.960
If only I had my Real Book with me and some kind of trumpet practice mute so I don’t bug (and by bug, I mean serenade) the neighbors…
