SXSW 2010 Official Celebrity Sighting Namedropping Post!

00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:08.612
Published on March 17, 2010.

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:14.646
I have lots of material to post from this year’s SXSW 2010 Interactive Festival.

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:20.740
First thing’s first, though: I need to document all of the celebrities that I sighted and took pictures with!

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.256
The first celebrity of South By came fairly early.

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:31.430
While leaving the Windows Phone party on Friday night, I ran into my old friend Pete Cashmore .

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.362
I can call him my old friend because we used to be in that 9rules thing together and he wrote about Notecentric and MapsKrieg on his Mashable blog.

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:45.057
I chatted him up a bit to see if he remembered me (he either did or was being nice).

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:47.075
And he was pretty nice, too!

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:52.769
He told me about the Mashable party at Buffalo Billiards (that I didn’t actually get a chance to go to).

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:59.502
Then I had to run off because there was a free taco truck nearby and Pete was trying to get into the Speakeasy anyway.

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:07.594
That same night I also spotted Scobleizer , but I didn’t talk to him because I was looking for additional Korean tacos and I already met him last year.

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:13.209
I also met some Jonas Brothers but later found out they were just cardboard cutouts.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:21.081
The next night, at the Frog Design opening party, I was waiting in line and met a cool guy named Mike D’Amico .

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.819
The line was for a photo booth.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.956
I guess we’re both pretty narcissistic.

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:30.652
Anyway, some gals ran up to mike and started talking to him.

00:01:31.152 --> 00:01:33.070
They seemed strangely familiar.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.406
I thought they were maybe in a TV show or small-time movie actors.

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:42.620
Once they started handing Threadless buttons to me I realized the magnitude of the situation.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.015
They were Threadless t-shirt models!!! Kristen and Colleen were both really nice.

00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:53.230
I took a picture with them, Threadless style, though I didn’t have a Threadless shirt on at the time.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.564
We exchanged business cards and I promised them I’d wear my Three Keyboard Cat Moon shirt the next day.

00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:07.836
Sunday was a slow day for celebrity sightings but that was probably due to the fact that I was busy preparing for my panel the next day.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:14.729
Monday turned out to be a good day, both for my panel (more on that in a later post!) and for celebrity sightings!

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:21.643
My friends Sameer and Maureen and I were heading to the 20×2 party but found the foursquare party along the way.

00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:28.056
The line was huge but somehow we became VIPs by drinking some Vitamin Water and having our pictures taken.

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:32.312
The party had a bunch of tables with t-shirts and schwag lined up.

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:38.486
I got a Brizzly, Foursquare and something else (some kind of iPhone app company) shirt.

00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:42.102
While at the foursquare table I saw that iJustine girl.

00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:45.159
I talked with her for a second and got a picture with her.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.655
She seemed nice enough, but kinda had other things to do besides talk to me.

00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:53.911
She probably needed to go stream her life or something, whatevs!

00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:59.306
danah boyd was also at the party but someone was chatting her up relentlessly.

00:02:59.806 --> 00:03:05.240
Sameer got her to say “Hi” (he’s met her before) but she had to run to the VIP area or something.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.137
She also seemed nice but kinda busy.

00:03:09.137 --> 00:03:16.409
Later that night, Sameer and I were in the line for the Mens room and ran into the CEO of Twitter, Evan Williams !

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.024
He was wearing the same dress shirt/sweater combo as during his keynote earlier in the day.

00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:25.880
Sameer asked for his business card and Ev nicely obliged.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.058
We didn’t get a picture.

00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:32.234
That might’ve been a bit too odd, given we were waiting for the bathroom.

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:38.088
I heard that Ashton Kutcher was also at the party but I didn’t head up to the VIP area to check him out.

00:03:39.088 --> 00:03:43.244
Overall it was a very good year for celebrity sightings at SXSW.

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:49.178
I really wanted to meet Cashmore last year, so it’s great I finally got to talk with him a bit this time.

00:03:49.678 --> 00:03:54.712
Next year I hope to run into even more famous celebrities like Guy Kawasaki or Leo Laporte!

00:03:55.212 --> 00:03:57.849
See you soon, SXSW 2011!
