In Defense of Food: Book Review

00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:06.454
Published on January 31, 2010.

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:12.009
According to Michael Pollan, food has been disappearing from supermarkets around the country.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.706
It’s being replaced by food-products, which are not quite food.

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:22.919
In Defense of Food argues that we should live by some simple rules: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.”

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:30.072
I had previously read The Omnivore’s Dilemma , and I figured I would continue my food reading with Pollan’s next book.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:37.125
While Omnivore was a hefty 411 pages, Defense is a very quick read; about 200 pages.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:46.815
Whereas The Omnivore’s Dilemma was a narrative adventure, following the path of a few meals, In Defense of Food is more about the history of our attitudes about food.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:57.065
Pollan explores the policy changes that gave way to subsidized farming and “nutritionism,” a form of reductionist science to ultimately dictate what Americans should eat.

00:00:57.565 --> 00:00:59.722
In that sense, it’s a much simpler book.

00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:04.298
A lot of the lessons learned in Omnivore’s Dilemma are in this one as well.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:11.431
In Defense of Food seems to focus more on the effect of the “food” we’re eating on our health, rather than the actual production of the food.

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:17.066
The second half of the book goes into detail on Pollan’s rules about eating.

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:22.840
These are simple tips, like avoiding food with too many ingredients, or ingredients that you can’t pronounce.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.296
If you follow all of them, your health should improve dramatically.

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:32.390
It’s a bit of a challenge, though, to go against the American culture of fast, processed, artificial foods.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.324
For example, as I’m writing this, I am staring at a package of Pepperidge Farms Goldfish Crackers.

00:01:38.824 --> 00:01:45.697
They contain such ingredients as “thiamin mononitrate” and “monocalcium phosphate,” so I shouldn’t really consider eating them.

00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:47.795
But they’re damn good, too!

00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:56.067
Since I moved out of my parents house and began making all of my eating decisions, I’ve tried to strike a balance between healthy and delicious.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:02:01.762
I’m pretty sure I could manage both, but delicious/easy tends to win over delicious/lots of work.

00:02:02.262 --> 00:02:06.177
It’s really encouraging to see these food rules, though, in a simple form.

00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:13.710
I think that I can slowly make a few small victories in my eating (and food shopping) habits that will eventually steer me into better health.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.783
One thing I have noticed in many of the books that I’ve been reading recently is the attack on reductionist science.

00:02:21.283 --> 00:02:28.475
The argument basically states that science relies heavily on breaking complex systems into smaller, easier to understand parts.

00:02:28.975 --> 00:02:32.971
These parts can be broken down further until they’re atomic, more or less.

00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:41.622
Reductionist science believes that once everything is broken down and understood on the atomic level, the system as a whole is understood, QED.

00:02:42.122 --> 00:02:48.755
The unfortunate proof is that systems are complex, and no one ever understood how a car works by overanalyzing the air freshener.

00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:58.945
In Defense of Food argues that “nutritionism,” the food science equivalent to redictionism, is one contributor to our total lack of common sense when it comes to food.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:03.281
We process foods so they lose nutrients, then we pump them back in.

00:03:03.781 --> 00:03:06.258
But nutrients might interact with others.

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:11.473
Fiber slows the absorption of something, certain vitamins are fat-soluble.

00:03:11.973 --> 00:03:16.928
Pollan’s solution is to just eat food that isn’t processed to remove all of the nutrition.

00:03:17.928 --> 00:03:21.763
Barabasi’s book also argues against scientific reductionism.

00:03:22.263 --> 00:03:25.060
Or at the very least it details the shortcomings of it.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.074
One example is that while we’ve fully mapped the human genome, it’s the interactions between genes that really matter.

00:03:31.574 --> 00:03:37.168
The fact that networks are a great way to model complex systems makes me excited about studying them.

00:03:37.668 --> 00:03:39.026
Am I getting off topic?

00:03:40.026 --> 00:03:44.581
In any case, In Defense of Food is a nice companion to The Omnivore’s Dilemma.

00:03:45.081 --> 00:03:48.118
I’d suggest you read the latter before you read the former.

00:03:48.618 --> 00:03:54.532
IDoF is a quick read and highly recommended for anyone who eats food or food-like substances for nourishment.
