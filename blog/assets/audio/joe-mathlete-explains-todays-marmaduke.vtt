Every once in a while, a blog comes along that changes the course of human history.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.360
That blog is Joe Mathlete Explains Today’s Marmaduke .

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.300
In it, Joe Mathlete (is he some kind of math athelete?) explains today’s Marmaduke.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.980
Apparently Marmaduke is a fairly unfunny one panel comic.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.240
Think Garfield or Family Circus, but perhaps even less funny.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.180
Joe Mathlete explains what is happening in the comic, and usually ends up being multitudes of infinity funnier than the actual comic.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.220
Unfortunately, Joe hotlinks to some kind of comic repository for the images, and the older ones are missing actual comic.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.520
I may have to add this blog to my RSS feed.
