SXSW 2011 Panel Proposal: “Quitters Always Prosper” Please Vote!

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:09.731
Published on August 12, 2010.

00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:18.403
I submitted a panel proposal to SXSW again this year entitled “Quitters Always Prosper: The Iterative Career Process.”

00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:22.179
Here’s the proposal as seen on the official panel picker :

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:29.492
Quitters Always Prosper: The Iterative Career Process You just graduated from college and started your first real job.

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:31.910
But it isn’t what you thought it was.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.563
Somehow, somewhere along the way, you made an error in judgment, or your company flat out lied to you about your job.

00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:39.862
What do you do?

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:45.717
Hear from a panel of young professionals who were in this same position and quit before they hit the one -year mark.

00:00:46.217 --> 00:00:52.530
They’ve since moved on to greener pastures and have found their true calling, or are at least a step closer.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.865
They are part of a larger movement who believe in an iterative career path.

00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:02.799
Disillusioned employees: share your pain and ask the panel how and why they made their decision to quit.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.654
Learn the warning signs of a bad fit during the interview process and in the first few days on the job.

00:01:09.154 --> 00:01:12.430
Know that you aren’t alone, and there’s something you can do about it.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.966
Employers: learn how to decrease new employee turnaround.

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.663
Discover the best incentives to retain great talent.

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:22.560
Learn when and when not to hire.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.138
When the going gets tough, quit!

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:30.752
Questions Answered: What are the warning signs before I accept a job that it is not a good fit?

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:35.328
What alternatives are there for reconciliation before sending in my resignation?

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:39.983
What should I do before quitting (e.g. securing a new job, etc)?

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:43.759
How do I explain my short stay to a potential new employer?

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.335
What should I learn from my bad experience, and how should I apply it to the next job?

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:52.910
</blockquote> As many of you know, I quit my job at Microsoft after about 6 months.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.566
There were a lot of reasons why, and it boils down to the fact that it just wasn’t a good fit.

00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:04.858
I’ve noticed a disproportionate number of my cohort from grad school who also left their first jobs after graduating within one year.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:10.473
I thought it would be interesting to do a panel on the subject and try to get to the bottom of this phenomenon.

00:02:10.973 --> 00:02:18.804
I think It’s of interest not only to people who aren’t happy at their jobs, but also employers who struggle with retention rates, especially among younger employees.

00:02:19.304 --> 00:02:21.302
I think it’ll be an interesting panel.

00:02:21.802 --> 00:02:32.591
While I moderated a SXSW panel at this year’s conference , I was thinking that I could either moderate again (it’s very fun and stressful) or be a panelist, since I’ve experienced it myself.

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:38.605
I’d really appreciate it if you could take the time to vote for my proposal, leave a comment, and spread the word !

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:43.740
As with my last panel, I think the subject is something that people think about, but often do not talk about.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.512
If we can get a room of like-minded people together, I’m confident that people can be inspired to make tough decisions and get more out of life!
