The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything – Book Review

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:07.573
Published on April 10, 2010.

00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:13.208
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about work, passion, fulfillment, etc.

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:18.183
Maybe I spoke too soon when I wrote about not having a Quarterlife Crisis !

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:23.099
So I picked up this book, “The Element,” about discovering your passion.

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:33.988
Ken Robinson argues that many people who are bad or disinterested in what they do just haven’t figured out what they’re good/passionate about, or have given up on pursuing the things they “should” be doing.

00:00:34.488 --> 00:00:38.324
Once people find that special something, they find a positive feedback loop.

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:42.499
They like doing it so they do it more, and they get better at it.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.956
They probably also get external positive feedback, etc.

00:00:46.456 --> 00:00:50.212
With this virtuous cycle, they can achieve super awesome things.

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:53.210
That’s the book in a nutshell.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.224
And I really didn’t have to read the whole book to see all the many permutations of this idea over and over again.

00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:06.037
I think this book really could’ve been a magazine article (maybe it started as one), rather than an entire book.

00:01:06.537 --> 00:01:11.731
I feel as though Robinson was scraping the bottom of the barrel at some points trying to fill the thing up.

00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:19.583
The writing is a bit simplistic (probably to cater to the lowest common denominator demographic), and in some parts it’s just plain bad.

00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:22.321
Here are some instances that I noticed.

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:30.753
Upon describing a woman who dropped out of college when she had her kids, then went back to college, graduated and was offered a big job:

00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:36.547
By then, she was having trouble in her marriage, and she filed for divorce.

00:01:37.047 --> 00:01:39.365
This was a difficult time for Susan.

00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:42.442
Really, Ken? No shit!

00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:48.936
Another completely non-sequitur to start a paragraph in a section about a crisis in human resources:

00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:53.931
At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, there was hardly anyone around.

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:58.687
It really sounds like you could’ve pulled this quote from a third-grade World History essay.

00:01:59.187 --> 00:02:05.900
On top of the patronizing language, the author seems to go off on tangents that have barely anything to do with the subject matter.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.697
Overall, I do agree with the basic message of the book.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:12.754
I just wish it was more focused and concise.

00:02:13.254 --> 00:02:15.891
Four stars for concept; two stars for content.
