Dual Monitors increase productivity by 20-30%, Cost by 100%

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.060
So I read this article by the New York Times about how having a dual monitor setup can supposedly increase your output by 20-30%.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.720
I’m actually convinced that it could be true.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.260
Most of the windows on my desktop take about 100-80% of the real estate on my screen.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:37.120
Whenever I switch applications, I have to go find which one I want in the tray on the bottom (with the number of apps I use at once, alt-tab is a bad idea).

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
Sometimes I have to go through 10 or more windows to find what I’m looking for!

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.180
With two monitors, I could have a web browser one (for example), and a work one.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.160
Because, yes, web browser !

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.300
= work. Or I should say, web browser = !

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.400
work. While it would be nice to have a dual monitor setup, it would also cost twice as much.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.020
And I bet movies wouldn’t look too good with the gap in the middle.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.360
Maybe I’ll just splurge on a giant widescreen monitor from Dell…
