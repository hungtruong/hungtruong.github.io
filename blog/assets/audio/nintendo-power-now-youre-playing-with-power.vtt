Nintendo Power – Now You’re Playing With Power!

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.780
Published on January 20, 2007.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.260
I saw this offer on Slickdeals for a 12-month subscription to Nintendo Power for like, $5 .

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.720
It got me to thinking about how cool Nintendo Power used to be.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.900
That’s right, used to be…

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:29.460
I remember getting a subscription to Nintendo Power when they had an awesome promotion where you got Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest in Japan) with a year’s subscription.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.880
That’s right, you got a video game for subscribing to Nintendo Power!

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.580
The deal was too sweet to pass up, so I finally convinced my mom to get me the magazine.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.840
I ended up getting addicted to RPGs because of Dragon Warrior, too.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.480
I pretty much learned how to read on Nintendo Power.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.500
It was so awesome.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.960
Nintendo Power would usually have entire maps of games laid out on two pages.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.340
I’d sit there and plan out how the game would actually play, even though I never ended up playing the actual games.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.940
I also recall there being some pretty cool comic strips like the Metroid one and Zelda one.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.680
There was also a comic about the origins of Wario, which was really weird in retrospect.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.760
I remember always trying to win prizes in the survey contests in each issue.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.980
They would be ridiculous prizes, like “win every single SNES game ever!”

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.320
Too bad I never won…

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.600
I guess my love affair with Nintendo Power ended with the whole Playstation generation thing.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.700
Like the Playstation got FFVII, and the Nintendo 64 graphics were horrible.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.160
I didn’t even get a Nintendo 64 (though my cousin did, and we had a blast with Goldeneye).

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.900
Plus I realized that Nintendo Power was probably the most biased publication ever.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.760
I don’t think I ever saw a score below 7.0.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.620
And there were definitely Nintendo games that were seriously bad.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.860
I did end up getting a Gamecube, and I really want to get a Wii.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.560
Maybe it’s time I resubscribed to Nintendo Power… Then again, do I really want to pay $5 for a subscription to Nintendo ads?
