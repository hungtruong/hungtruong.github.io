Google Calendar Released Tonight!

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.780

Google Calendar has just been released, and I tried it out a bit.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.160
It’s pretty easy to input appointments, and it works a lot like Microsoft Outlook’s calendar.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.940
I still haven’t found an import option, which would have been nice.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.440
You can export the calendar in the iCal format, but when I tried reimporting to Outlook, it didn’t work…

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.160
The main difference is that with Google Calendar, you’re able to share your calendar with others.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.860
You can also see events that are either public, or events that are located in your friends’ calendars.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.320
Pretty cool concept, though I haven’t tried that part out (it was just released tonight, remember!?).

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.800
Although the interface is nice and easy to use, I don’t know if I’d go for this instead of the current calendar system I’m using.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.420
Basically, I use the Outlook calendar as my main, and sync my watch, pda, and phone to it.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.800
Google Calendar seems okay, but I’d like to have my calendar even when I’m not online.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.740
Until I can sync to it, I probably won’t end up using Google Calendar as my main schedule organizer.
