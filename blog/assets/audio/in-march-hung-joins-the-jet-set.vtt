In March, Hung Joins The Jet Set

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.180
Published on March 21, 2007.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.460
Or at least it seems like it.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.840
Earlier in the month, I rode on a bus with the UNM basketball band to Las Vegas.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.940
I guess that doesn’t count as “Jetting” but hey, I was traveling.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.280
Just last week, I flew with the basketball band to Hartford CT.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:32.760
Tomorrow, I’m flying to California for a Google job interview, then flying from there to Michigan for the University of Michigan School of Information Visiting Days.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.060
Finally, on the 26th I fly back home.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.820
That’s a lot of cities in one month, and a lot of frequent flier miles.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.240
Hopefully I can get something cool.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.180
Like a magazine subscription!

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.300
I’ve just finished printing all of the documents that I think I’ll need to find my way around (this is my first time flying alone).

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Plus I gotta take taxis and shuttles and all sorts of crap that I never thought about when traveling around with my family.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.280
Hopefully everything will go without a hitch.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.860
Maybe I’ll even get to do one of those things where I give up my seat and make mad bank for it, flying out the day after!

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.400
One can only hope.
