Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and Wynton Marsalis in Ann Arbor 1-16-08!

So I just got back from a concert with the LCJ and Wynton Marsalis.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.600
Man, those guys are good!

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.960
They did some kind of tribute to Duke Ellington’s love songs.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.100
While it was a good set, I would’ve like to hear, y’know, songs from other people.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.560
Wynton and the gang are already criticized enough for playing “era” music, so it’s weird that they limited themselves even further.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:47.200
The sounds were definitely authentic-sounding, but it’s funny because whenever someone takes a solo, you can hear them sort of drift into the future (or our present) and play licks that would have been unheard of (well, at least unheard) in Duke’s band.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.220
I mean, what’s the point of sounding so accurate and then playing a solo that’s got hard bop licks?

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.380
Overall though, it was pretty sweet.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.360
And they played C Jam Blues as an encore.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.500
Just for the record, if I was a girl, I’d totally have Wynton Marsalis’ babies. That’s all!
