Xbox 360 For $100 at Amazon.com: Live Blogging!

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.140
Published on November 23, 2006.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.260
So I’m sitting here trying to get the Xbox 360 at Amazon.com for $100.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.640
It’s like some kind of special Thanksgiving deal.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.020
Amazon started being unresponsive at around 11:55, and now it’s totally dead.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.840
I figured I’d blog about it, since I have a lot of free time waiting for the page to load.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.600
I think the main mechanics of who will get the Xbox will work like this:

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.720
People who are “lucky” will actually get the page served to them.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.980
The chances of this happening are pretty slim, since there’s like a billion people frantically reloading at this point.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.640
Once you are “lucky” and get a page served to you, you must get “lucky” a few more times since you’ll have to check out and everything.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.900
I guess it would have been a good idea to set up that one click checkout thing at Amazon.com prior to this event.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.040
Anyway, people will slowly start getting the available boxes until they are all gone.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.360
Of course, the site will still be unresponsive long after all of the Xboxes are taken.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.220
This is because the continued unavailability of the site will cause people to think the deal is still on.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.960
And plus they can’t access the site since everyone is still frantically reloading.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.760
So who knows, maybe all the Xboxes are taken, and I’m just wasting time reloading and sitting here blogging about reloading…

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.160
Update: they’re all gone.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.340
Well that was a waste of time…
