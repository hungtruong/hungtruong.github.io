Super Customer Service at the Apple Store

About two weeks ago, my GF got a refurbished iPod Touch from the Apple online store.

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:17.224
The refurb was pretty cool, but it seemed to have a really low battery life.

00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:23.877
I made an appointment with the Apple Store App for the Genius Bar and the guy who helped us was really cool.

00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:29.832
We explained that she just bought the refurb and it was pooping out after like 3-4 hours of use.

00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:36.885
The guy showed us some battery saving techniques (like lowering the screen brightness and turning off location services, etc).

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:40.581
At this point I was like, “come on guy, I already know that!”

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:45.476
Then he just gave us some paperwork to sign and a new iPod! YESSS.

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:51.191
The awesomeness here is that he didn’t question us like we were total idiots and assumed we were right.

00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:56.326
He didn’t make us do any stupid diagnostic tests to prove we were telling him the truth.

00:00:56.826 --> 00:01:04.498
This is what set the experience apart from others, like when I call the cable company and they make me turn my modem off and on, etc.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:11.711
Thanks, Apple! The only thing I would’ve changed is that I scheduled the appointment for like 7:30 and they didn’t get to me until around 8.

00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:17.346
The new iPod is working a lot better, so I’m glad we went in to do the switch.

00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:22.960
In other news, I am thinking of getting an iPad, because (gasp) I was wrong .

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.894
In the future I should probably forego the knee-jerk assumptions for new products before I actually try them out.

00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:34.828
I can probably just say I did it for the lulz again and go on to become the next John C Dvorak .

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.326
The iPad is actually quite neat.

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:41.502
Understanding the iPad HIG goes a long way toward appreciating it.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:47.835
I also wrote an iPad version of my other app, so I’d like to actually try it on a real device at some point.
