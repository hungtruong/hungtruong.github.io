Cooking Mama DS Demo Video

Over at Kotaku, there’s a live demo of the Nintendo DS game, Cooking Mama .

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.240
I think this game is geared towards girls; It’s a cooking simulator.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.320
In the demo, we see the various stages of cooking a hamburger steak.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.380
The onions get sliced and diced, the pan is buttered, the onions are fried, the hamburger is kneaded, and finally the hamburger gets fried in the pan.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.880
There’s also a final step with the Hamburger being decorated with side veggies (and a Japanese toothpick flag!).

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.480
I dunno about this game.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.700
I mean, we already have a freakin’ surgery game !

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.520
How can cooking be more compelling than that?

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.620
I could be wrong, of course.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.720
We’ll just have to see if this wacky game makes it to the US.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.140
Either that, or you could import it …
