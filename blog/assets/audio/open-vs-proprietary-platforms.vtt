Open vs. Proprietary Platforms

There’s been a lot of talk lately about proprietary platforms.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.146
Apple has been rejecting apps left and right due to various reasons.

00:00:15.646 --> 00:00:21.560
For example, they rejected the Google Voice app using their generic “duplicates iPhone features” reasoning.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.416
Isn’t that kind of reasoning grounds for an antitrust case?

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:30.391
They also rejected a dictionary app for potentially bad words!

00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:32.330
Someone think of the children!

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.762
While I think Apple deserves some credit for popularizing the whole app store notion, they also kind of suck for holding such an iron grip on it.

00:00:41.262 --> 00:00:46.935
It’s nice to find apps in the store without having a third party directory or searching for apps all over the mobile web.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:52.070
But it sucks when honest developers get screwed because of totalitarian control.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.468
I wonder if there can’t be a nice, happy medium.

00:00:55.968 --> 00:01:01.322
Maybe an app store combined with a way to legally (without jailbreaking) install apps via a third party.

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:09.733
For now, the iPhone’s App Store is great for customers, but I have a feeling that abused developers will eventually learn their lesson and go elsewhere.
