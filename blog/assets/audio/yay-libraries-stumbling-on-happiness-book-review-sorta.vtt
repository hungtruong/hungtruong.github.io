Yay, Libraries! + Stumbling on Happiness – Book Review Sorta

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.300
Published on October 22, 2007.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.380
One of the things I’ve rediscovered in Ann Arbor is a place from my childhood.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.600
A place where you’d go in elementary school to go look up facts, and perhaps even borrow a book.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.260
And you didn’t even have to return it!

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.040
Ever! That’s right, in my short time here, I’ve already rediscovered libraries.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.200
I dunno why I forgot about them.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.020
Probably because the libraries in New Mexico aren’t as good as the ones in Michigan?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.280
My local library of choice here is the Ann Arbor District Library .

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.280
This library has like everything.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.300
Books, CDs, DVDs, Books on CDs.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.400
Soon they might have DVDs on Books… I found that the library had a lot of things that were on my Amazon.com wishlist , too.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.600
And Stumbling on Happiness is the book I’m going to attempt to review.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.600
Despite the title, Stumbling on Happiness is not written by Dr. Phil, as my friend Adam Torres presumed.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.980
It’s written by some psychology professor from Harvard.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.200
And it doesn’t explain how to become happy either!

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.140
It sort of explains why people think they’re doing things that will make them happy, but end up not being happy.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.580
“So why did you read this, Hung!?”

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.440
You might ask.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.340
Because knowing what makes people unable to become happy might provide a clue on how to actually become happy.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.000
And plus I already checked out the book, and it’s due on Tuesday, so…

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.800
The general style of the book is fairly analytical, but also sort of explained in terms that normal people can understand.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.580
There’s also quite a bit of humor involved, which makes the seemingly dry task of figuring out the definition of “happiness” a bit more gratifying.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.480
One chapter starts off, “The last decade has seen an explosion of books about poop.”

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.580
This is my kind of writer.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.660
While I don’t agree with everything the author says, he does use lots of real case studies and examples.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.760
Some of which seem cooked.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.020
But the main point is quite clear.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.280
People can’t predict what will make them happy because their brains aren’t really equipped to make such a prediction accurately.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.740
It’s sort of this fight against your brain’s natural reasoning capacity, and you’ll always lose.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.780
At the very end, Daniel Gilbert offers a way to escape this mental trap: phone a friend.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.320
It only works if the person is presently in the exact situation you want to be in, however, since human memory is really messed up.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.980
So really the solution is more of a cop-out.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.120
Even though I do ask people for advise a lot, I still get the feeling they are far too removed from my personal context to be accurate forecasters of my future self’s happiness.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.360
Overall, I did enjoy the book, thanks in part to the wacky humor.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.420
Though it could’ve contained a lot more.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.120
Stumbling on Happiness shouldn’t be taken as pure fact.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.260
In healthy doses, however, I think the ideas and advice within might actually prove useful to those in search of happiness.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.600
Which is like, everyone?
