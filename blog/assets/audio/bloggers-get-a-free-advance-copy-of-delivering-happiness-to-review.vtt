Bloggers: Get a Free Advance Copy of “Delivering Happiness” To Review!

00:00:05.496 --> 00:00:08.452
Published on April 07, 2010.

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:14.886
I had a conversation with someone about how I still have a blog, and that it’s totally old school to write one.

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:18.343
I mean, everyone’s microblogging, etc now, right?

00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:25.556
Well I guess I’ll have the last laugh because bloggers can get a free advance copy of “Delivering Happiness,” that Zappos guy’s book.

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:28.613
Just go over here and tell them you blog like an old man.

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:34.328
A lot of the stuff from Tony Hsieh’s talk from SXSW is still permeating my brain.

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:38.743
Like company culture, building a product that matters, etc.

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:45.157
So I’m looking forward to reading this book, either if I get it for blogging, or if I buy it when it eventually comes out.

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:48.294
I already have it on my to-read list on GoodReads .
