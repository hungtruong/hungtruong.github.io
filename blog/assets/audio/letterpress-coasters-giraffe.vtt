Letterpress Coasters – Giraffe!

00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:07.493
Published on October 14, 2010.

00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:13.288
I finally got the rollers for my letterpress machine yesterday, so I tried printing something.

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:17.404
I had ordered all the other supplies I needed, including:

00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:21.441
A crapload of blank coasters (1000)

00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:23.959
A giraffe printer’s block

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:28.875
I already had the ink from my purchase of the machine.

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:34.409
The machine itself is from 1941, and the ink was from the same company, in a tube.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:39.784
I’m not sure the ink is from 1941, but if it is, it’s held up really well!

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:45.339
I also bought a bunch of other stuff that ended up helping me a lot when troubleshooting.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:52.632
Luckily, I read a lot of posts on briar press and was eventually able to get a decent looking impression on my coasters.

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.707
At first, the ink was getting onto the block, like behind the giraffe’s neck.

00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:02.283
This meant that the ink rollers were pushing up too hard against the printing surface.

00:01:02.783 --> 00:01:06.299
I had to adjust the pressure by putting some electrician’s tape on the chase bed.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.472
Three layers of tape made the rollers touch the printing surface just right, while not getting on other stuff.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.509
The impression itself was also a little too deep at first.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.804
You could see the part of the block that pressed into the coaster (which at this point didn’t have ink).

00:01:22.304 --> 00:01:27.338
So I adjusted the pressure of the platen (the part that runs into the printing surface) with a screwdriver.

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:32.793
After getting a few crazy impressions, I started getting the hang of the adjustments.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.690
I got quite a few good looking coasters.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.587
Here’s a video of the machine in action:

00:01:39.587 --> 00:01:45.900
I’ll be experimenting with letterpress stuff some more once I get different colored inks and more printing blocks.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.953
I’d also like to get a printing base so I can make my own photopolymer plates (printed from normal Illustrator files).

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:58.807
Those cost quite a bit though, so I’d like to see what my press can do before blowing a lot of cash on it.

00:01:59.307 --> 00:02:06.660
I also put the coasters I made on sale at Etsy, so take a look at my giraffe letterpress coasters and buy ‘em before someone else does!
