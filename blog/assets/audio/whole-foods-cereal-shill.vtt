Whole Foods Cereal Shill

00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:06.774
Published on February 25, 2012.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:13.847
I was at Whole Foods today getting some groceries when I came across this mini food testing area at the end of an aisle.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:19.222
There were two nice sales people (one lady and one dude) who were hawking cereal.

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:23.318
The type of cereal was super organic and it came in a pouch.

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:28.133
The lady bragged that all of the ingredients were on the front of the bag in large type.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:37.184
The cereal was available for testing in cereal form, baked into a cookie, and blended into a smoothie (which was apparently made with apple cider and yogurt or something).

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:49.772
Sidenote: While I was deciding what to taste test (I eventually went with the smoothie and it was not bad, and followed up with a chunk of cookie), an old Asian lady walked up to me and started talking in Chinese.

00:00:50.272 --> 00:00:55.706
I tried to tell her that I don’t really speak Chinese, but I forgot how to say “I don’t know Chinese” in Chinese.

00:00:56.206 --> 00:01:01.161
It’s kind of absurd, anyway, to say you don’t speak a language in that very language you’re saying you don’t speak.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:04.937
Anyway, she mumbled some more stuff and then said “Chinese.”

00:01:05.437 --> 00:01:07.595
Like, yeah, lady, we’re both Chinese.

00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:10.013
I guess she walked away after that.

00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:13.889
So anyway, here’s the real part of the story.

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:19.104
I’m tasting the cookie and am about to leave when another woman walks up to the food tasting area.

00:01:19.604 --> 00:01:27.995
The sales guy asks if she wants to buy some cereal and she’s like “oh, I already have some at home! I love it! I’m just going to have some samples.”

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:34.169
And they get into this conversation about how great the cereal is. I caught some more of their conversation as I walked away.

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:39.224
Only later did I realize that the cereal-praising lady was probably a shill !

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:42.041
It was literally the oldest sales trick in the book!

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:45.338
I mean, no one gets that excited over cereal, right?

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:49.594
She was really into it; a little too much into it to be believable.

00:01:50.594 --> 00:01:57.067
Perhaps I am just cynical, but I would love to hang around Whole Foods to see if the same lady came over and did that multiple times.

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.962
The sad part is that I can see the shill bit working on quite a lot of people.

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:04.859
It probably didn’t work on the Chinese lady, though.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.638
She didn’t speak English.
