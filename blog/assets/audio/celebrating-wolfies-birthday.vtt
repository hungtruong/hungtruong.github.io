Celebrating Wolfie’s Birthday

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.820
Published on December 18, 2008.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.660
Today, December 18th (it might be the 19th by the time I finish this post), is my good friend Wolfie’s birthday.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.960
His name is John, but his nickname is Wolfie.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.900
It might seem weird for me to write a post about my pal’s birthday.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.160
I guess the reason I’m writing it is because Wolfie passed away this Summer while on a trip in Barcelona, Spain.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.180
He would’ve been 25 today.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.380
I could be sad and dwell on how unfair it was that Wolfie wasn’t able to even see his 25th birthday.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.680
But when I think about him, it’s really hard to be sad, or mad, or anything besides happy.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.120
We had some really good times, and I’m really glad I was able to meet him.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.580
He was one of my best friends for a good portion of high school.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.440
And we had great antics.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:11:45.220
Like the times we (and Patrick) went to the state fair and annoyed people on the expo floor, or the time Wolfie sneaked into David Tod’s house to steal a picture of David Tod in a bunny suit on Easter, scanned it and replaced it while I stood lookout a la Hitchcock’s Rear Window, or the time we recorded a drum, guitar and trumpet track of a song with just the two of us, or all the random junk we did on band trips.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.540
He didn’t have a lot of time here, but he sure packed a lot into what he had.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.280
I guess it sounds cliche, but it’s true.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.860
And in a way, Wolfie has really inspired me to make the most of my time.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:05.960
I really hope that I never end up sleepwalking through life, aimless, because that would be a waste of time that I have, that Wolfie never had.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:14.800
While I’m writing about lessons, I also want to say that throughout everything that happened, Wolfie’s mother, Mera, has been nothing but positive.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:22.100
She sent an email (which I won’t reproduce without her permission) reminding us to celebrate his life, all the good times, etc.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.840
She’s really the sweetest person I’ve ever met.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.580
Much love to her (I hope I can catch up with her before I leave town this time).

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.760
She’s an inspiration and I hope I can be more like her someday.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.840
In conclusion: Happy Birthday, Wolfie!

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.940
I miss you.
