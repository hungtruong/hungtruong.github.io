I just saw this ad on Facebook:

00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:15.806
The words that jump out are obviously MEDIUM CHEESE and $3.99.

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:21.181
But if you actually read the thing, you’ll find out that you have to buy another pizza first.

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:24.238
Jerks. The first pizza is $13.

00:00:25.238 --> 00:00:28.594
Guess what I do when faced with deceptive advertising?

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:32.530
I click away since they are probably working on a pay-per-click model.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.629
Take that, Dominos!

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.526
No return on your ad and you have to pay!
