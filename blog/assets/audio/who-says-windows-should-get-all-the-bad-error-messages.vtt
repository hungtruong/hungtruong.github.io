I just saw this on my Macbook Pro while trying to move a file:

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.366
I tried it a few times and it gave me the same useless message.

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:21.740
Then I figured out that I was trying to copy a 4GB+ file to a Fat32 partitioned drive.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.914
I can figure that out from memory, but OSX should be able to tell a less informed user…

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:35.147
Oh, and by “move” I mean copy, paste, then delete, since OSX doesn’t have cut + paste…
