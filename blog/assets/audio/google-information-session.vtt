Google Information Session

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.220
Published on October 26, 2006.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.940
So some dudes from Google showed up on Wednesday at UNM to talk about Google.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.520
Apparently, it’s a pretty awesome place to work.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.860
Like they have all you can drink, and mini kitchens where you can order free food.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.120
They go on company ski trips and don’t even think twice about it!

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.260
Oh, and it seems they’re really casual too.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.660
I went ahead and gave them my resume.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.440
Maybe they’ll hire me.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.900
Apparently the hiring process takes about 6 months, though.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:44.600
To help pass the time, they gave me a pen, a pad, and a long sleeved red shirt that says “Google” on the front, and “I’m Feeling Lucky” on the back.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.100
It’s so nerdy and awesome!

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.900
Also, I’ve been looking for grad schools.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.120
I thought I had graduated from sending applications and getting letters of recommendation, but yeah, I’ll have to think about that stuff again.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.180
I was thinking that Stanford will be my primary school, and Harvard will be my backup.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.480
What do you think?
