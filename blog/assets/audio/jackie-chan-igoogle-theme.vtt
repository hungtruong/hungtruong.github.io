Jackie Chan iGoogle Theme

I use iGoogle a lot.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.880
One of the more recent things that has come along with iGoogle is the introduction of artist themes .

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.140
I guess they’re there to break up the monotony of a boring home page.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.700
I was going through the gallery when one such theme caught my eye: Jackie Chan!

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:39.720
The theme is a cartoony (but not like the Jackie Chan cartoon … and on a side note, isn’t it kind of ridiculous that they needed to hire a voice actor for the cartoon to play Jackie with a fake Chinese American accent!?) fictionalization of Jackie Chan apparently filming a movie where he fights ninjas.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.700
That’s fine, but who the heck drew this?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.080
If you told me Jackie drew it, I’d believe you.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.580
And it’s also the only way I’d forgive the slanty-eyed caricature of Jackie.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.200
May is Asian Heritage Month , people!

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.000
Anyway, I’m using it as my iGoogle theme, because it’s funny and I like Jackie Chan.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.340
Even if he does look a bit like a racist stereotype. Oh well!
