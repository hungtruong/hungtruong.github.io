No, it’s not really a new series, just a promo for the newest season of the Simpsons.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.220
The Sun Online Reports:

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.060
A balding actor plays Homer as he leaves work dropping some nuclear waste out of the window on the way home.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.180
While a baby girl copies the scene where Lisa appears to be driving Marge’s car.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.860
The opening montage ends with the whole family squeezed on the settee ready to watch the cartoon version of the show.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.140
Interesting promo. I still think The Simpsons sucks though.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.400
Ever since Conan quit…
