Wii Play for Nintendo Wii – Review

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.700
Published on March 15, 2007.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.380
I got Wii Play from Amazon.com yesterday.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.280
The main selling point is that it comes with a wiimote and costs $50, so the game itself is worth $10.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.900
It comes with a bunch of minigames, much like Wii Sports, but they’re not all sports.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.180
Out of the nine, I’d say 3 or 4 are actually fun to play.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.540
The Shooting Range game is not Duck Hunt, which makes me sad.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.040
Basically you just shoot stuff.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.980
Sometimes the Duck Hunt ducks will fly by and you can shoot them, but otherwise you just hit targets.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.900
Find Mii is lame, unless you enjoy finding people in crowds.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.440
Table Tennis is really weak, because you can only control the horizontal action of the paddle.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.740
Tennis in Wii Sports is about 100 times better, and it comes with the Wii when you buy it!

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.640
Pose Mii is also pretty boring.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.040
Laser Hockey is actually very fun.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.060
The graphics are cool, and who doesn’t like air hockey?

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.080
I need to get a friend to play this one with me, since the CPU is kind of dumb.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.260
Billiards is good too.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.640
It’s not quite ready to be its own game, but I enjoyed it (and I actually played it more than once).

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.480
Fishing is worthless.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.900
This looks like a tech demo.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.080
An unfun tech demo.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.380
Charge is kind of okay, and very surreal.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600
I like how it uses the wiimote, at least.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.420
Tanks is also very fun with the nunchuck.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.200
I imagine getting 4 players would make this very, very fun.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.720
In the end, if you’re looking to get an extra wiimote anyway, then Wii Play isn’t a bad buy.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.900
If you already have enough controllers, I don’t think it’s worth $50 for the game.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.360
There’s some good games, and there’s some not so good games.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.060
I personally think Wii Sports is more fun.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.920
Laser Hockey might be worth $10 by itself though.
