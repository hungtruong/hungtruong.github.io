00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Hung’s Jazz Mix “Tape” 2008!

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.880
Published on December 30, 2008.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.400
A few weeks ago I made a trip with a bunch of colleagues/friends to go see some Jazz in Detroit.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.000
We went to a place called “Baker’s Keyboard Lounge,” which is apparently the oldest jazz club, ever.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.400
That night, a group played which I would describe as a “mixed bag.”

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:31.160
The rhythm section was outstanding, but the sax player was okay and the trumpet player (who was, sadly, also the bandleader) was in serious need of some lessons in improvisation.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.240
Most of the people I went with weren’t Jazz connoisseurs.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.200
I sort of think of myself as an intermediate one since I’ve been involved with Jazz (playing and listening) since middle school.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.360
Anyway, I promised I’d make a Jazz primer for those interested, and I kind of let it get onto the backburner for a while.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:58.680
I could’ve just grabbed some tracks but I wanted to comment on what to listen to or what I liked about each track so it would be more accessible (Jazz is hard to get into if you don’t know what to look for).

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.920
Basically I went through my music collection looking for tracks that I thought were representative of something.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.120
Either of a standard tune or an artist or a genre.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.920
I tried not to duplicate songs or artists.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.680
It was kinda hard.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.520
I found what tracks I could that were available on AmazonMP3.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.720
So if you wanted, you could download almost the whole mix legally!

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.240
The MP3 widget and my liner notes follow:

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.920
1. Antonio Carlos Jobim - Wave

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.120
One thing I always suggest to do when learning Jazz standards is to learn the words.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.600
The words for Wave are really cheesy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.320
Example: “When I saw you first the time was half past three/When your eyes met mine it was eternity” Antonio’s famous for “Girl From Ipanema” but Wave is also pretty classic.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.680
2. Art Blakey - My Romance

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.840
Art Blakey is a weird sorta monolith in jazz.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.120
I think he’s famous for having a group (The Jazz Messengers) that’s always featuring new talent.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.120
When the musicians “graduate” from the group, new ones take their place.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.680
Former members include Lee Morgan, Freddie Hubbard, Wynton Marsalis and Terence Blanchard (so what if I mention just the trumpet players? They’re good)!

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.240
I also like this song because of the lyrics and the group just sounds really great live!

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.200
For more on the actual song, see this post that I wrote when I had the song stuck in my head !

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.880
3. Bill Evans - Autumn Leaves

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.960
Autumn Leaves is like the quintessential Jazz standard.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.840
By “standard” I mean that if you’re a gigging musician, it’s a song you need to know.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.360
Since everyone knows the standards, you can just get a random group of guys together and instantly jam out.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.080
There’s a lot of versions of Autumn Leaves that I like (including one by Chet Baker) but I thought I’d include some Bill Evans love.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.000
4. Bob Mintzer – Oye Como Va

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.560
Bob Mintzer is a Jazz saxophonist who does contemporary sounding (but not too contemporary) arrangements for his big band.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.280
Oye Como Va was made famous by Santana, but it was originally composed by the Latin Jazz dude, Tito Puente.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.680
Bob Mintzer always changes something up when he puts his own spin on things.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.080
Here, he messes with the head itself.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.640
When the trumpets come into the melody, they play the it syncopated.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.120
He’s also kind of known for adding “noodly parts” (as my old Jazz Band director Glenn Kostur would say) in the background.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.560
You could listen to a Bob Mintzer tune a few times and still not catch everything going on in the background.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.720
5. Bobby Shew – Cubana Chant

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.400
Bobby Shew is from Albuquerque, just like me!

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.640
Once I went to see him when he came back and I got him to autograph my shoe!

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.400
Unfortunately it was the bottom of my shoe and when I walked around for a little the autograph faded away.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.840
TRUE STORY!

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.640
Bobby was primarily a lead player (played high notes) and later on started doing improvisation as well.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.840
He’s not as good as many players, but at least he’s better at improvising than Maynard Ferguson… Cubana Chant is a tune that I played in my high school combo my senior year.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.560
I probably still have the video, actually.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:13.560
Maybe I should post it online some time… It’s sort of interesting because the changes (the chord progression) is basically rhythm changes (from I’ve Got Rhythm) but in a minor progression.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.000
Rad.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.760
6. Charles Mingus – Haitian Fight Song

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.280
Charles Mingus is a badass bassist.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.960
A lot of his compositions are outside of the “norm” of Jazz.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.880
I guess Haitian Fight Song is actually pretty “in” when you think about it.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.240
I played “Fables of Faubus” in high school, but I figured I’d include this because it’s a bit “easier” to listen to, being a minor blues and all.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.480
7. Charlie Parker – Scrapple From the Apple

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.240
Charlie Parker’s nickname was “bird,” mainly because he had an actual bird’s beak and feathers.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.920
Just kidding.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.600
Scrapple From the Apple is your typical early bebop tune.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.760
A sorta complicated head followed by some pretty complicated solos.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.720
Pretty much just dudes trying to one-up each other.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.200
This tune is pretty much synonymous with Charlie Parker, so I figured, why not?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.080
8. Chet Baker – There Will Never Be Another You

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.040
This is one of my favorite standards.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.520
It’s not really that well known, though, I guess.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.320
The lyrics are cool and so are the changes.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.480
It’s not too often that the lyrics to a song match the music perfectly.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.800
This is off the album “Chet Baker Sings,” so it’s nice to hear him play and then sing (like a girl).

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.880
9. Clifford Brown – Blues Walk

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.880
Clifford Brown was a super awesome virtuoso trumpet player who could play bebop insanely well.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.520
He died young (at 25) but he left a huge impact on Jazz anyway.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.760
Clifford died in a car crash.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.360
My friend Mark says that’s why you don’t let women drive you around!

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.800
Anyway, Benny Golson wrote “I Remember Clifford” in his memory.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.760
Ironically, it’s a ballad (and not super fast bebop as Clifford was famous for).

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.320
Also, this is why you never hear recordings of Clifford Brown playing “I Remember Clifford,” unless you’re stuck in some kind of paradox alternate universe.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.280
But he does play Blues Walk pretty damn well.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:16.280
Check out near the end of the song where Clifford and the sax player (sorry, unnamed sax player) trade ever decreasing amounts of measure!

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.480
Pretty sweet.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.480
10. Dexter Gordon – Confirmation

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.720
Dexter Gordon is a tenor sax bebop-ist who I got into because my friend Mark (also a tenor sax bebop-ist) was into him.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.000
Dexter Gordon has a helluva lot of recordings.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.720
One thing that’s apparent is that he’s pretty good.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.360
Another thing that’s apparent is that if you listen to more than one solo of his, you’ll hear him play the same riffs in each one.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:50.920
Nothing wrong with that, but Dexter Gordon makes it kinda more apparent than any other Jazz artist I’ve heard (besides myself, since I always use the same three patterns).

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.800
Confirmation is another bebop tune that has an extremely complicated melody.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.920
It’s like they made it hard on purpose just to show off.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.360
11. Dizzy Gillespie – Manteca

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:10.040
Dizzy Gillespie is the trumpet player that’s famous for having the puffy cheeks and the funny trumpet with the bell at a 45 degree angle.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.360
If you’re a trumpet player, don’t do that (unless your name is Dizzy Gillespie)!

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.680
Dizzy is also famous for being a pretty good bebop player and pioneering the Afro-Cuban style of Jazz.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.560
If you’re wondering what that is, just listen to the percussion.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.920
12. Ella Fitzgerald + Louis Armstrong – A Fine Romance

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.240
I like vocal Jazz.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.280
Ella and Louis did two recordings singing together.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.800
It’s funny because it makes me think they were a couple, with them singing so many love songs together.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.520
Their recordings are also funny because Louis’ raspy voice is continually juxtaposed by Ella’s super smooth voice.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.720
Also, Louie Armstrong says “bitches” in this song!

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.640
13. Freddie Hubbard – Up Jumped Spring

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.600
Up Jumped Spring’s got a pretty interesting melody and changes.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Freddie Hubbard has a really sweet tone.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.080
It’s like a perfect combination.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.800
Plus he composed this song himself, so I suppose it makes sense that this is a good recording… Current Events Alert!

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.560
Freddie Hubbard died on December 29th, which comes after I made this list but before I published it!

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.280
14. Harry Connick Jr.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.360
– Basin Street Blues

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.120
Basin Street Blues is sort of a standard, I guess.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.720
Maybe not.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.240
Oh wait, it is!

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.560
Miles Davis even has a version!

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.600
I remember playing it in middle school jazz band.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.280
Harry Connick Jr. is a Jazz pianist and vocalist from New Orleans who has a super sweet voice!

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.560
So it’s cool that in this song you get to hear him play piano and sing, simultaneously!

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.160
15. Herbie Hancock – Chameleon

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:57.000
I’d have included the Maynard Ferguson version of Chameleon but I figured I’d put the original here and any enterprising listeners can find the Maynard version themselves.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.480
Herbie Hancock is pretty far out.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.480
Let’s just get that out of the way.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.400
Chameleon is funky.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.160
I consider Funk to be an offshoot of Jazz, just like Blues.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.600
Whatever you use to classify this song, I think it’s pretty sweet.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.360
It’s also pretty long, but that’s what happens when you’re funkadelic.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.960
16. Horace Silver – Nica’s Dream

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.920
I really, really like the melody for this song.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.400
I played it in college Jazz Band.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.480
The director, Glenn Kostur, told us that Nica was some kind of modern day saint for Jazz musicians.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.280
Like she had some kind of crib where they could stay?

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.800
And then she died?

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.640
I don’t quite remember.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.880
Anyway, Nica is a cool chick.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:46.200
The song itself is sweet as well, with a Latin Jazz kinda mentality, switching to swing in the B section (kinda like A Night in Tunisia!).

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.840
17. John Coltrane – The Night Has a Thousand Eyes

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.160
You might think I’d stick “Giant Steps” into this compilation, but that’d be too predictable of a move.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.800
John Coltrane is pretty much a badass.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.440
I’m pretty sure he learned every single scale known to mankind and made up some more in his quest to become the ultimate improvising machine.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.440
And he pretty much succeeded.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:17.080
The Night Has a Thousand Eyes is a good example of how Coltrane can play “around” the changes and still come up with something that makes sense because it’s based in theory.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.160
18. Lee Morgan – Hocus-Pocus

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.160
I wonder if there’s too many trumpet players in this compilation.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.680
Oh well.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.000
Lee Morgan is another great one.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.840
Apparently (I just read this on Wikipedia) Morgan was shot when he asked his girlfriend to bring him his gun.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:42.280
Just another thing not to ask women to do, along with driving you around, if you’re a Jazz musician and want to avoid an untimely death…

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.960
19. Bli Blip – Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.800
The LCJO is pretty much Wynton Marsalis’ group.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.400
This is a live recording from a Duke Ellington Tribute concert.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:02.112
Some people criticize the LCJO because it doesn’t really do anything original, that is, it plays very traditionally and is sort of anachronistic in a way.

00:11:02.512 --> 00:11:09.392
This recording is actually very close (same arrangement) as a version that Ella Fitzgerald sang with the Duke Ellington Orchestra.

00:11:09.792 --> 00:11:11.472
I guess it’s intentional though.

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:15.552
The vocals (by Dianne Reeves) are just insanely good.

00:11:15.952 --> 00:11:18.272
And it’s just a fun track, so enjoy!

00:11:19.072 --> 00:11:22.112
20. Miles Davis – My Funny Valentine

00:11:22.912 --> 00:11:25.392
Miles Davis is also a badass.

00:11:25.792 --> 00:11:29.232
I guess I tried sticking a lot of badasses in here, what can I say?

00:11:29.632 --> 00:11:34.992
Miles is so badass that he can just quit playing the melody after a few measures and go straight into his solo!

00:11:35.392 --> 00:11:39.072
And he doesn’t even empty out his spit valve when he seriously needs to!

00:11:39.472 --> 00:11:44.112
Plus he plays with the stem in his harmon mute, which is something only he’s allowed to do.

00:11:44.512 --> 00:11:47.312
Miles is cool because he uses silence effectively.

00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:50.749
The parts he doesn’t play are as important as the parts that he does.

00:11:51.149 --> 00:11:53.949
Also, he got into Juilliard and then dropped out!

00:11:54.349 --> 00:11:55.949
That’s how badass he is!

00:11:56.349 --> 00:12:01.869
Jazz Lesson: At around the 1:15 mark, the bass player goes into a pedalpoint.

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:06.429
Which is a fancy word for saying he just plays the same note over and over again.

00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:09.229
Bass players just do this to be jerks.

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:13.629
21. Natalie Cole – Almost Like Being In Love

00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:18.989
When Natalie Cole’s not singing with her dead father, she sings by herself (and a big band).

00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:27.629
I remember my high school band director playing this track for us in class as an example of how the voice is just as legit an instrument as one that you can hold in your hand.

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:31.309
I think this song was also in Groundhog Day, which is braggable.

00:12:32.109 --> 00:12:38.029
22. Nicholas Payton (with Wynton Marsalis and Roy Hargrove) – The Three Trumpeteers

00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:42.029
I’m a trumpet player, so this song is like pure awesome for me.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:46.749
The three guys play through rhythm changes and sound like they’re having a hell of a time doing it.

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:49.469
This has got to be one of my favorites, ever.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:53.949
23. Roy Hargrove – I Remember Clifford

00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:56.109
Hey, it’s a ballad!

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:57.709
About Clifford Brown.

00:12:58.109 --> 00:13:00.829
I remember Clifford Brown, and the Alamo, too.

00:13:01.229 --> 00:13:09.869
I like that even though the song is a ballad (about 60 bpm), the rhythm section switches to pseudo double-time in the solo part, so it sounds more upbeat.

00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:14.349
24. Sarah Vaughn – Lullaby of Birdland

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:18.909
Sarah Vaughn has a really sweet voice with a really sweet range.

00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:21.389
I’m pretty sure she can sing lower than me.

00:13:21.789 --> 00:13:25.549
She also scats pretty well (the singing, not the bodily function)!

00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:31.789
I have a pet peeve with the lyrics in this song, rhyming “Birdland” with “Wordland” but hey, it’s still a good one.

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:35.789
25. Sonny Stitt – The Shadow of Your Smile

00:13:36.589 --> 00:13:39.309
This track features some kind of “electric saxophone.”

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:45.869
I’m not sure if it’s like a weird effect that Sonny Stitt is using, or if he’s actually wielding an instrument of pure energy.

00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:48.109
Either way, it has a funny sound.

00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:50.189
I also like the organ in this song.

00:13:50.989 --> 00:13:53.949
26. Wynton Marsalis – Caravan

00:13:54.749 --> 00:14:00.029
Marsalis Standard Time has a bunch of standards, predictably played by Wynton Marsalis.

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:03.549
He kind of plays them non-standard though, but it’s cool.

00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:09.869
The solo that he plays is especially out, only going back “in” every once in a while to relieve some tension.

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:14.349
Caravan is a pretty old standard, made famous by Duke Ellington.

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:18.829
There’s a bunch of other songs that I really like, but this will probably suffice for now.

00:14:19.229 --> 00:14:22.509
Memorize these tunes and I’ll make a new Jazz Mix at some point.
