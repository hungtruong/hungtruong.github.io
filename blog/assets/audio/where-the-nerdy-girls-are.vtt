Where the Nerdy Girls Are

If you’re a nerd (like me) and you’re looking for a nerdy girl (like me (me not being a nerdy girl, but one who is looking for a nerdy girl, just thought I’d clarify)), Wired has a little article on “ The Anatomy of a Nerd .”

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.840
Unforunately for those of us stateside, it’s about Onna Otaku (Girl Nerds) in Japan.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.440
Apparently, you can find them on “Otome Road in trendy Ikebukuro.”

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.220
I’ll have to remember that.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.100
Now, the model they use for a typical Onna Otaku is pretty hawt.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.760
In fact, I’d say they just used a regular model and dressed her up all geek chic:

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.200
Y’know, it’s probably like those cool geeks you see in Taco Bell commercials.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.100
There aren’t geeks that are as trendy as that!

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.160
Certainly not ones that eat at Taco Bell!

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.940
I mean, as far as geeks go, I’m as cool as they get…
