iAd Vs. AdMob – Clicks, Fill Rate, Impressions, eCPM and Revenue

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:10.051
Published on February 07, 2011.

00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:18.163
About two weeks ago I updated one of my apps to use AdMob mobile ads when iAd fails to deliver (pretty damn often).

00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:27.534
Instead of swapping out iAd for AdMob, I use the iAd “didFailToReceiveAdWithError” delegate method to request an AdMob ad when iAd fails.

00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:33.228
This means that AdMob shouldn’t take any income away from iAd, but only supplement it.

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:38.123
I thought I’d take a look at the stats and compare the performance of the two ad networks on my app.

00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:44.237
(The following numbers I’m referring to are from the time period from 1/25 to 2/7)

00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:51.471
For an idea of scale, my app, Anime Nano , gets about 600 iAd requests per day.

00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:56.925
My app analytics software (Flurry) is saying I’m getting about 600 sessions per day.

00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:08.534
The thing is that about 1/5 of those sessions are on the iPad (and I haven’t enabled iAd on the iPad yet), so I think that on average, the iPhone apps are making a little more than one iAd request per session.

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:15.927
Despite the fairly healthy rate of requests that I’m getting, iAds are only getting sent about 15% of the time.

00:01:16.427 --> 00:01:19.064
This percentage is what’s known as the “fill rate.”

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:23.160
This is also what most developers complain about being too low.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.415
The clickthrough rate is actually pretty good at 0.81%.

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:33.370
When iAd fails to deliver (85% of the time), I fall back to AdMob.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.863
The fill rate for AdMob is a high 88%, though the past few days it’s been closer to 99%.

00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:46.197
The CTR, however, is a fairly low 0.25%, which is less than half of iAd.

00:01:46.697 --> 00:01:52.211
This is partly due to the fact that AdMob ads refresh more often, so the number of impressions is higher.

00:01:53.211 --> 00:02:00.164
I’m going to describe my revenue in terms of percentages here since ad platforms typically don’t like it when publishers publish their income.

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:04.020
Not sure if that’s changed lately, but whatever!

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:15.788
In the time period from 1/25/2011 to 2/7/2011, I made 2.3x more with iAd than AdMob, even with the super low fill rate (and impressions) of iAd.

00:02:16.288 --> 00:02:20.284
This is pretty interesting since iAd only shows up 15% of the time.

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:32.372
There were actually a few days where AdMob beat iAd, but there were a couple of days where iAd made a killing (relatively), probably from those super awesome interactive ads which I still haven’t experienced firsthand yet.

00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:39.445
For now, I’m content with the fill rate of AdMob, though it sort of pains me to see such a low click rate and revenue per click.

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:49.615
Something tells me that if AdMob worked harder at increasing ad quality (like iAd), they’d be able to charge more and their advertisers would probably see a better return on investment.

00:02:50.115 --> 00:02:55.789
Most of the advertisers don’t even bother to use an image ad, which I assume would increase the clickthrough rate.

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.305
I noticed something really strange when looking at ads on my app.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:05.839
There’s no way for advertisers to disable ads on devices that already have the app installed.

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:12.653
I keep seeing Amazon Kindle ads on both my iPad and my iPhone that already have the application installed.

00:03:13.153 --> 00:03:19.785
As a developer, I know there’s a way to prevent those ads from showing by detecting whether the app is installed at runtime.

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:24.201
I think this strange behavior happens on both iAd and AdMob.

00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:28.457
If anyone from either organization is reading this, contact me !

00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:38.487
As far as the future of ads in mobile apps goes, I hope Apple will continue working on increasing the fill rate, and that AdMob tries to increase relevancy and ad quality.

00:03:38.987 --> 00:03:43.542
Right now it’s really frustrating to see my “inventory” not live up to its revenue potential.
