Ingrid Michaelson in Ann Arbor! (12/12/07)

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.380
Published on December 14, 2007.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.100
So my friend Krystle made it clear on Monday that she wanted to see someone named Ingrid Michaelson in concert on Wednesday.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.120
I had no idea who this person was, so I checked out her website and listened to a few songs.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.220
Apparently she’s had quite a few songs appear in Grey’s Anatomy and in TV commercials like Old Navy.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.020
I thought she sounded pretty good, but what about live!?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.680
Now, a lot of times, an artist will sound good on a CD merely by virtue of having a good sound guy to tweak the pitches to perfection.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.300
But after seeing a clip of her sing the Old Navy commercial song live, I was convinced.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.720
She sounded even better live!

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.720
So three of us went to the concert on Wednesday, almost freezing to death in line due to a sloth-like ticket ripper dude at The Blind Pig.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.300
This guy was seriously doing like, one ticket a minute.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.840
It’s a good thing Krystle got the tickets early, because they apparently sold out while we were in line.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.080
The set started out with some stuff by Allie Moss, who also serves as Ingrid’s backup guitar and vocals.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.500
It’s a very economic setup.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Allie was actually quite good.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.020
But everyone was kind of ready to hear Ingrid after a few songs.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.600
And once Ingrid started singing, it was apparent why Allie is the sideman and Ingrid is the headliner.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.860
Her voice is freakin’ awesome!

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.560
Basically, Ingrid can do pretty much whatever she wants vocally as far as range and other weird things that people learn in voice training.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.240
While some of her songs are a bit simplistic and “funky” in terms of arrangement, I think her voice really makes up for her lack of anything else.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.340
Ooh, strange cognitive dissonance: Right before she came on, the DJ dude or whoever asked everyone to stop smoking because she’s sensitive.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.320
But the lyric in her song says “If you need a light, I’ll find a match!”

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.860
I know it’s just a lyric, but hey, come on!

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.620
Ummm what else?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.880
The Old Navy song (The Way I Am) and the Breakable song were really good.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.460
I mean, mostly everything was good.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.960
Also, it felt like VH1 storytellers because we’d get the story behind a bunch of songs, which works well when you don’t have a bunch of songs to fill up a set.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.820
Ingrid had a good stage presence, seeming very humble.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.040
Though perhaps it was well rehearsed humbleness!!! I don’t really doubt her humbleness though, she seemed really nice.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.140
Like she’d get happy when people knew what song she was playing.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.520
Also, she told a story about how she was doing a promo event at Borders and said “Thanks to Barnes and Noble for having me!”

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.620
Oh, and she pointed out that there’s a live version of a song on her Myspace page where, at the end, she says “thanksss~~~” and it sounds really funny.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.820
There were also a bunch of covers thrown in for good measure.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.360
She played Mele Kalikimaka, a naughty Christmas song called “Trim Your Tree,” (in fact, here it is !) and “Can’t Help Falling in Love.”

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.860
I probably sound like I’m enamored now, but seriously, anything her voice touches turns to GOLD!

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.460
So yeah, it was a good show, and it was cool to see her before she eventually becomes stinkin’ famous.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.320
Hopefully she’ll come around the Ann Arbor area again some time soon.
