In Soviet Russia, Ms. Pac Man Plays… Ms. Pac Man?

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.620

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.260
So some AI nerds taught a video game playing agent to play Ms. Pac man .

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.200
Well, actually, they taught it how to teach itself to play Ms. Pac Man…

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.280
I didn’t know that Pac Man was deterministic, and Ms. Pac Man was random.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.140
I think this proves that the actions of women are generally more difficult to predict than of men.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.760
Wait, are the ghosts in Ms. Pac Man also women?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.820
And I thought Ms. Pac Man was married to Pac Man!

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.080
Well, she still could be technically, and keep her Ms. title.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.200
I think they have kids though, so at least they’re an item.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.160
Wait a minute, when did I stop talking about AI and start talking about Mr. and Ms. Pac Man’s relationship? Oh well…
