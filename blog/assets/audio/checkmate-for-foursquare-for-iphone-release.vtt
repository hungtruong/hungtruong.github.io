My second iPhone app, Checkmate , just got approved in the Apple App Store last night.

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:16.984
It’s an auto-check-in app that runs in the background.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:23.877
You select your favorite venues, and Checkmate will check you into them when you get close enough, even when the phone is still in your pocket!

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:30.371
I wrote this app because I got annoyed at forgetting to check into places on foursquare while there.

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:35.766
If you’d like to get Checkmate, you can buy it here for the low price of $2.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.303
For more info, check out the official website I made for it.

00:00:39.803 --> 00:00:42.599
And follow Checkmateapp on Twitter for news on the app.
