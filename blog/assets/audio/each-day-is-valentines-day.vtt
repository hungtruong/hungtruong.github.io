Each Day is Valentine’s Day

So I thought it’d be fun to do a recording of My Funny Valentine, since it’s a pretty cool song and it’s also almost Valentine’s Day.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.760
Not that I particularly like the holiday, being single and all… I like the song because it’s got weird mixed signals.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.900
Like the lyrics are somewhat upbeat, but the music itself is so freakin’ sad!

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.420
Anyway, here’s me playing My Funny Valentine along with a cool dude named Jamey Aebersold.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.880
I recorded it using the iSight from my Macbook, and the built in mic, so the sound quality isn’t the best.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:49.100
Also, I screwed up a few times, but hey, the song itself is about an ideal non-ideal valentine, so my solo doesn’t have to be perfect!

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.820
And here’s the lyrics in case you don’t believe me:

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.420
My Funny Valentine

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:07.800
My funny valentine Sweet comic valentine You make me smile with my heart Your looks are laughable Unphotographable Yet you’re my favorite work of art Is your figure less than Greek?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.980
Is you mouth a little weak?

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.840
When you open it to speak?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.700
Are you smart?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.520
But don’t change a hair for me Not if you care for me Stay, little valentine, stay Each day is valentine’s day
