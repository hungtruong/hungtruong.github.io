00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Banished From Boggle

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.180
Published on November 07, 2007.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.260
There’s a Facebook app called “Bogglific.”

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.120
It’s sort of the Boggle equivalent to Scrabulous.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.020
Anyway, my boss Gillian likes playing it, so I added it to play against her.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.200
And she beat me handily.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.020
So handily, in fact, that I was resolute to come up with a way to have my revenge.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.300
I’m the kind of person who likes to play smart, not hard.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.560
And I’m a programmer.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.580
So put one and one together.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.320
Go ahead, I’ll give you some time to predict what I did.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.520
YES, I WROTE A PROGRAM TO CHEAT AT BOGGLE!

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.480
I mean, it’s sort of this fun problem if you think about it.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.620
My solution used a lot of recursion (probably too much), and a dictionary function that verified actual words.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.060
And it worked pretty well, too.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.040
I beat one of my coworkers 70 points to 1.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.340
Of course, afterwards I fully disclosed this information.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.840
I’d never be able to live up to the hype if someone challenged me to a live game anyway.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.060
I mostly cheated to see if my program was any good.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.080
And apparently it was.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.540
My plan was to make it to the top of the leaderboard, then retire from the business altogether.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.420
I have to hand it to the Bogglific people; they’re pretty clever.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.640
They detected that I was cheating and banned me.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.820
And I have nothing against that.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.480
I knew what I was getting wrapped up in.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.300
I still even have my pride intact, since it was my program that I was cheating with!

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.840
I understand though that cheaters should be banned.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.660
It really isn’t fair for everyone else who comes up with their three and four letter words.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.180
I’m thinking of adapting my Boggle solver into a Facebook app.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.560
For educational purposes only, of course.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.820
Like, check out all the words you missed!

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.720
It’ll be a sort of Boggle trainer…

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.600
Anyway, I am taking my Boggle banishment in stride.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.260
I hold nothing against my oppressors.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.960
At least now I’ll have some free time to work on my Scrabulous Solver (which is actually a somewhat more computationally complex (and interesting) problem…).
