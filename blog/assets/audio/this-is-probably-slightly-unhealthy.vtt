This is Probably Slightly Unhealthy…

Published on March 22, 2008.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.580
It all started as a joke.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.520
A RickRoll. Following a link like “ Starcraft 2 leaked trailer! ” and instead being presented with a video of Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.”

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.800
But you have to admit.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.540
The song is pretty damn catchy.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.280
You know, with the whole peak of the chorus at “say goodbye!”

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.700
The mp3 version of this song is much better quality than the youtube encoding.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.540
Also, this past week something legendary happened.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.480
The first ever “real life” RickRoll via singing telegram.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:52.060
In the long term this kind of internet meme crossover is dangerous (imagine a real life Goatse.cx or a real life flash thing with the ghost popping out at you), but I approve of the creativity of the real life RickRoll .

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.260
Anyway, I should probably stop listening to this song.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.880
But I can’t.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.300
Like the title of the song states, I’m never gonna give it up… (never gonna give, never gonna give!)
