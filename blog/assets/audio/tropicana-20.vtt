Tropicana 2.0

While I was grocery shopping last week, I noticed something incredibly awesome.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.345
Tropicana (my oj of choice) had changed the design of their box!

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:21.640
Now, I liked the old design, but it really was looking a bit 2008.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.818
The new one looks really sweet.

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:31.131
I like how the orange juice is displayed in some kind of pseudo wine-glass that no one would ever really drink orange juice in.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:36.745
You can’t see from the picture, but the glass also runs along the other side of the box as well.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:44.198
Also, kudos to whoever decided to stick the leaves next to the orange cap, making it look like an orange! So genius.

00:00:45.198 --> 00:00:47.515
I also really like the logo.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.052
Just a simple font in one color, no gradients.

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:54.429
New Tropicana box designer: I salute you!
