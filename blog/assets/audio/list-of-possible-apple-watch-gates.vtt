List of Possible Apple Watch “Gates”

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:06.295
Published on April 23, 2015.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:11.929
Everyone I know loves a good Apple product-based trivial controversy.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.466
There was Antenna-gate, and Bend-gate which happened just last year.

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:23.158
Back when the first iPhone came out, Apple dropped the price a few months after release and early adopters were pissed.

00:00:23.658 --> 00:00:30.371
No one can say if there will be a real issue with the watch, but I figure it would be fun to make a list of potential ones.

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:35.447
Battery-gate (the battery doesn’t last long enough! I can’t wear it to bed!)

00:00:36.447 --> 00:00:41.241
Bend-gate 2 (the wristband bends too much! It doesn’t bend enough!)

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:47.036
Snap-gate (the wristband cracks and snaps! WTF is fluoroelastomer anyway?)

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:52.111
Crown-gate (the digital crown breaks off! It spins too fast!)

00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:57.427
Siri-gate (random people shouting “Hey Siri!” can control my watch!)

00:00:58.427 --> 00:01:02.342
Shave-gate (The Milanese Loop is shaving my wrist hair off!)

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:05.819
Edit: Thought of a couple more this morning:

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:11.694
Left-handed-gate (can’t wear watch on right hand, digital crown doesn’t spin right!)

00:01:12.694 --> 00:01:17.409
Sunglass-gate (can’t see the screen while wearing polarized sunglasses at a certain angle!)

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.845
White-band-gate (white sport band gets dirty too easily!)

00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:26.920
I doubt any of these will happen, though Battery-gate seems most likely.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.455
Maybe something completely trivial and impossible to predict will ruin the watch launch.

00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:36.071
What sort of non-issue do you think will fill up the news cycles?
