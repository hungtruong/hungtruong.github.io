List of Possible Apple Watch “Gates”

Everyone I know loves a good Apple product-based trivial controversy.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.025
There was Antenna-gate, and Bend-gate which happened just last year.

00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:22.759
Back when the first iPhone came out, Apple dropped the price a few months after release and early adopters were pissed.

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.492
No one can say if there will be a real issue with the watch, butI figure it would be fun to make a list of potential ones.

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:32.889
Edit: Thought of a couple more this morning:

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:37.885
I doubt any of these will happen, though Battery-gate seems most likely.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:43.179
Maybe something completely trivial and impossible to predict will ruin the watch launch.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.556
What sort of non-issue do you think will fill up the news cycles?
