Deadly dolphins released into the wild!

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.120
The Guardian reports that trained military dolphins with death darts have been released in the Gulf of Mexico!!

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.880
Experts who have studied the US navy’s cetacean training exercises claim the 36 mammals could be carrying ‘toxic dart’ guns.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.980
The US Atlantic bottlenose dolphins have apparently been taught to shoot terrorists attacking military vessels.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.100
This is even worse than sharks with laser beams attached to their heads, because dolphins are way smart!

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.320
I hate to say it, but it looks like we’re gonna have to send in some Navy seals to take care of the dolphins!

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.100
Buh dun dun!
