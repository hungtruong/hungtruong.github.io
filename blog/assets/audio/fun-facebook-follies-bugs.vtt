Fun Facebook Follies (Bugs)

One nice thing about constantly iterating your code is that you get new code out quickly to your users.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.880
The bad part is you probably don’t do enough testing and your users get code before it’s ready.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.440
Facebook gives you a choice to mark notifications that you get as spam.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.660
This is for when your friends won’t stop sending you notifications that you’ve been bitten by werewolf them.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.520
Apparently, you can also mark any notification as spam.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.500
Even, say, Facebook’s own wall feature.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Facebook’s. Wall. Feature.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.520
You know what would be cool?

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.100
If Facebook developers weren’t so zealous that they skip sanity checks in order to get their pushes out sooner.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.800
Unless Facebook wants users to be able to mark their walls as spam.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.420
Which is actually understandable, now that I think of it…
