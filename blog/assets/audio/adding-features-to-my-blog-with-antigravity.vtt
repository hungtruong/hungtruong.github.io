Adding Features to My Blog With Antigravity

00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:07.733
Published on January 31, 2026.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:14.007
I’ve been using Google Antigravity as my main AI-powered IDE for the past month or two.

00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:19.622
But something tells me I’ll probably switch soon, as Google keeps making it less and less useful.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:25.795
In the meantime, though, I’ve added a ton of new features to my blog, and I figured I’d write about some of them.

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:29.273
Hitting Antigravity Quota Jail

00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:39.403
I was using Claude Opus for a while with Antigravity, as the limits were pretty generous and renewed every 5 hours, similar to Claude Code and Codex.

00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:44.458
I actually think that Google gave more Opus usage than Claude Code itself did!

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.276
At least at the time I was trying it out.

00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:53.790
I found that Gemini 3 Pro is good enough, but why not use Opus if I have access to it anyway?

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.966
I was using an extension to track how much remaining quota I had.

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:06.857
Unfortunately, it seems like I may have used too much, because Claude Opus and Sonnet began resetting on a weekly basis instead of every 5 hours.

00:01:07.857 --> 00:01:15.369
I suppose that it’s probably not profitable for Google to provide this much Claude for a cheaper subscription (I’m on the $20 plan).

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.624
But then they shouldn’t really imply that you’re going to get that much usage from the beginning.

00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:22.282
It feels a lot like a bait and switch.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:27.257
Others on the Antigravity subreddit also feel like the IDE was better before.

00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:32.652
It was about a week ago that I started getting the week-long refreshes on Opus.

00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:37.707
At that time I just switched over to Gemini 3 Pro and Flash to do my work instead.

00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:41.883
I favored Pro since, why not, I’m a pro!

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:48.057
But after using up the quota a few times on that model, I got the banhammer for the pro models as well!

00:01:48.557 --> 00:01:54.151
So now I have a week-long wait to get my Anthropic and Gemini Pro models back to this stupid IDE.

00:01:55.151 --> 00:02:00.185
So anyway, now I’m just hanging on with Gemini 3 Flash resetting every 5 hours.

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:03.162
Maybe I’ll get hit with a weekly refresh on that, too!

00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:10.695
At that point I’ll just switch to using Gemini CLI since it seems like it uses a separate method of calculating quotas.

00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:19.367
It also doesn’t help that sometimes, Gemini will just get into a really strange loop and start sounding like a kid in a Japanese horror anime .

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:28.678
I already wrote a whole blog post about my process of adding audio articles (which sound like they’re read by me) to my blog with Qwen3-TTS.

00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:36.050
I mentioned that I used AI, and the models that I used were mainly Gemini 3 Pro and Flash due to Opus being drained.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.368
Semantic Search With Embeddings!

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:48.619
Since my blog is actually a static site hosted on GitHub Pages and generated by Jekyll, it takes a bit of work to make it seem dynamic.

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:58.869
I had initially vibe-coded a simple search based on a JSON index that had the text and tags of each blog post, that basically did keyword matching in a text field.

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:05.762
That worked pretty well, but I’ve never had a chance to use text embeddings, even though people say that they’re pretty useful.

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:12.436
I figured that I could learn something about text embeddings and also add semantic search to my blog.

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:16.132
Like killing two birds with one stone, if you’re into that sort of thing.

00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:21.267
I basically had AI talk me through how it would work, and then I had it implement it for me.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:30.718
But I do feel like I have a better grasp of how semantic vector search stuff works, even if I can’t really think of a good reason to use it besides over-engineering my blog search.

00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:38.990
My first naive attempt to implement this was using bge-m3 , which AI told me was a really good embedding model.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.486
But when I tested out the search, I was getting some pretty bad matches.

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:50.539
It seemed like nothing matched higher than 50%, and I got some irrelevant matches for queries that seemed pretty simple.

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:59.829
Once I asked AI why this was happening, it mentioned that I wasn’t using all of bge-m3’s capabilities, since Cloudflare could only store a fraction of the data.

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.905
That would’ve been nice to know before it told me to use bge-m3!

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:13.417
Anyway, I switched over to using qwen3-embedding-0.6b which is also supported by Cloudflare’s Vectorize product.

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:24.306
The semantic search is still more of a toy at this point, but it did return a post about Pokemans when I search for “pikachu” (the blog post doesn’t contain the word ‘pikachu’ in it).

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:36.175
I also set up a GitHub workflow so that every time I update my blog, the index is updated in case I add a new post, or edit an existing one (or I guess if I delete one but why would I do that?).

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:42.189
I’ve been trying to automate as much as possible with my blog so that I have less friction to just write in it.

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.225
Replaced Staticman With a Cloudflare Worker

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:55.477
I recently added comments back to my blog using Staticman , which is an interesting concept, but kind of overkill for me and my blog.

00:04:55.977 --> 00:05:02.370
I didn’t have anywhere to host it, so I was just hosting it on my home server and exposing it to the internet with Cloudflare tunnels.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.624
This seemed okay but if my home internet connection went down then no one would be able to comment on my blog!

00:05:09.124 --> 00:05:11.521
That would be like a Sev 1 in this household.

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:22.671
Since Staticman is open source, I just had Antigravity look at the repo, and make an API-compatible endpoint with Cloudflare Workers that I could point my blog’s comment form to.

00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:31.402
It took surprisingly little time, and from there I was able to add all sorts of features like spam checking (with AI of course) and rate limiting, etc.

00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:38.934
I’m not too worried about Cloudflare going down but if it does then the internet probably has bigger issues than not being able to comment on my blog.

00:05:39.934 --> 00:05:41.053
Jekyll or Not?

00:05:42.553 --> 00:05:49.106
I was actually considering moving my blog off of Jekyll since the technology is old and I’ve been wanting to spruce up my blog a bit.

00:05:49.606 --> 00:06:01.674
But I realized that Jekyll is pretty flexible in terms of adding features in a way that not every blogging platform is. I can just prompt an AI to add a feature, and Jekyll is extensible enough to just let me do whatever.

00:06:02.174 --> 00:06:08.806
Also, it’s kind of nice that the site is static and doesn’t use any computing resources aside from the search feature I added.

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:17.159
For now I’ll just keep my blog the way it is. I feel like I stopped blogging as much after it became kind of a pain to edit markdown files, etc.

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:23.332
But now that I can edit posts with AI, I actually find blogging with markdown to be a bonus.

00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:28.787
Adding a link is probably about the same amount of work with the prompt “Add this link __ to line __ .”

00:06:29.287 --> 00:06:35.360
But it’s also kinda cool to ask the AI to fact check my blog and spellcheck it so I don’t make as many stupid mistakes.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.116
Anyway, that’s basically what I’ve added to my blog so far.

00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:44.052
It’s pretty fun adding features to it, even though no one will read it.

00:06:44.552 --> 00:06:49.027
Or maybe if I add more features, people will finally start to notice it! Nah!
