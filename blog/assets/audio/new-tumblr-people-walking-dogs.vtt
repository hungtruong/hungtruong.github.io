New Tumblr: People Walking Dogs

00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:06.373
Published on March 19, 2012.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:11.527
When Betsy left to work at Razorfish, I decided to commandeer her desk.

00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:12.826
It’s really nice.

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:16.761
It has lots of natural sunlight and a good view (minus Atkins’ head).

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:22.534
One thing I noticed right away is that a lot of people walk their dogs along the street in front of said window.

00:00:23.034 --> 00:00:25.590
Maybe it’s just the unseasonal crazy nice weather.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.765
Anyway, I decided to start a Tumblr of pictures of people walking their dogs.

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:30.904
Why?

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:32.203
Why not?

00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:36.478
Mostly this is a way to practice my camera phone slinging skills.

00:00:36.978 --> 00:00:41.612
I’m not used to swiping up to get to the camera (it’s a new iOS 5.1 gesture)!

00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:47.704
Also, I have a theory that once something becomes sufficiently easy to do, there’s really no reason not to do it.

00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:52.518
So, while it lasts, please enjoy my photos of people walking their dogs outside my office window.

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:55.335
Hopefully I will get a book deal soon.
