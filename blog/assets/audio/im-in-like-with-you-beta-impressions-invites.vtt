Published on June 21, 2007.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.780
Yesterday I tried out i’m in like with you , another hip startup type thing.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.600
It’s a social network that lets you find cool people near you and play “games” with them.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.940
The games involve setting up a question and having others answer them.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.840
Like the dating game?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.540
Then you get points for being the most clever or something.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.420
I’m not sure why this site is getting so much attention.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.960
It’s okay, but it has yet to offer enough users.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.180
There’s no women within 100 miles of my zip code!!!

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.020
Oh, and yet again, I have invites if anyone wants to try this.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.020
Also, there was once this site called “ Consumating ” that was really similar.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.280
I had fun with it for a few weeks or so, but it got old.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.540
Then I went back to Facebook.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.640
I have a feeling i’m in like with you will suffer a similar fate.
