To Prove To Dad I’m Not A Fool

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.820
Published on August 22, 2006.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.980
Yep, it’s time to go back to school!

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.000
I actually finished signing up for classes like, an hour ago.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.640
This semester I’m doin’ 14 hours!

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:28.980
The classes are: Marching Band, Jazz Band, Software Engineering, Beginning Chinese, International Politics, and an online version of Technical Writing (because I’m lazy).

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.640
I need to take a full time load, even though I only need Software Engineering to graduate.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.140
Why? For like, health insurance.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.500
Chinese should be cool, because then people won’t ask my why I’m Chinese, yet don’t know the language.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.120
International Politics just sounds kind of interesting to me.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.500
Plus it’s at 11AM, which is not too early.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.360
Technical Writing should be okay, since it’s online, and I need to get better at that kind of writing anyway.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.440
I’m also TAing a CS class.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.300
It’s just an applications class for Business majors, so it probably won’t be too hard.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.280
Mostly stuff in Word and Excel I think.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.560
Hopefully I’ll pass Software Engineering, and graduate in December!

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.580
Then it’s off to (Job/Grad School/Slacking Off)!
