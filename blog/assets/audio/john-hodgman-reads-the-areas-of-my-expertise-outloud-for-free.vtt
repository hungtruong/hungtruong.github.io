John Hodgman Reads “The Areas of My Expertise” Outloud For Free!

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.380
Published on December 19, 2006.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.460
So John Hodgman is quickly becoming a major internet sensation.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.520
He’s the guy who plays the PC in those “I’m a Mac, I’m a PC” ads.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.980
He also makes me like the PC enough to keep using it.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.900
He recently wrote a book entitled “ The Areas of My Expertise ” which makes a lot of nonsense.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:41.160
Actually, the full title is “An Almanac of Complete World Knowledge Compiled With Instructive Annotation And Arranged In Useful Order By Me, John Hodgman A Professional Writer, In The Areas of My Expertise.”

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.100
It’s pretty funny, though.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600
Actually, I’ve never read the book.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.700
Instead, I’m listening to John Hodgman read it to me, for free!

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.320
The book is available free (for now) on iTunes.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.280
Right now, he’s reading the table of contents.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.740
Apparently the book lasts hundreds of CDs, so the table of contents is really long.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.800
He’s joined by Johnathan Coulton, who sings the theme song for the audio book.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.020
Apparently, pairs of Johns are usually very entertaining.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.380
Since this is an “annotated edition,” I’d actually think about buying the book (and reading it)!

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.640
The book’s only like, $11 on amazon.com , so it wouldn’t be too difficult of a decision.
