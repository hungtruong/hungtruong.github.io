Will it Blend? That is the Question.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.620
Published on August 14, 2007.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.540
So I was turned on to the “ Will it Blend ” phenomenon a while back when an Apple iPhone was blended.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.800
“Will it Blend” is a video podcast of sorts featuring a mad scientist type guy blending random objects that probably shouldn’t be blended.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.840
Objects range from the aforementioned iPhone to Tiki Torches to (my personal favorite) Halloween glow sticks.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.300
The episodes take a pretty formulaic approach.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.880
The scientist guy talks about what he’s going to blend, picks a mode (like smoothie) and blends the item.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.100
The camera shows the item being blended initially, then pans out to show the dude in an awkward position, blending the object.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.180
Once blending has commenced, the scientist dude opens the blender top.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.960
Then the phrase “_ __ smoke, don’t breath this” will occur.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.060
And the verdict?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.160
Yes, it blends!

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.980
How could we for even one second doubt the blending power of Blendtec blenders!?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.460
Of course, reason that everything blends is probably due to the fact that Blendtec produces the show as well as the blenders.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.040
Still, it’s pretty damn entertaining for a random video podcast.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.020
Plus when they do change up the format, it’s awesome.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:29.080
Sort of like if you were watching Scooby-Doo and it turned out that the ghosts were real, or Scooby was actually a ghost, or if Velma and Daphne started making out like they did in the movie!
