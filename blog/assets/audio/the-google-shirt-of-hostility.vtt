The Google Shirt of Hostility

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.740
Published on July 05, 2008.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.660
So a while back I scored a free Google shirt (my first of many).

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.200
This was while I was at the University of New Mexico, where the school colors are “Cherry” and “Silver.”

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.660
The shirt itself was red with white text.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.720
Kind of like this cup (I couldn’t find a pic of the actual shirt, and I didn’t want to take a pic of it; it’s kind of faded now):

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.200
Just imagine that cup in shirt form.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.540
Anyway, the shirt colors fit the UNM colors. Pretty sweet!

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.900
Now fast forward to… now.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.320
I’m at the University of Michigan, and our colors are “Blue” and “Maize.”

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.900
Our sworn enemy, Ohio State, has the colors of “Scarlet” and “Gray.”

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.360
Which is basically the same as my old school’s colors.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.940
Kind of hard to disassociate with.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.640
Anyway, I’ve noticed that while walking around with my red Google shirt on, people seem to give me more dirty looks (than usual).

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.220
Like I was at Meijer last week and I could’ve sworn I noticed some hostility.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.140
I figured the Google shirt (remember, imagine the cup above as a shirt) reminds them of the Ohio State shirt:

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.740
That might just be my crazy theory, but I think it works.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.440
I’m sure from a far enough distance, the red Google shirt could look like the Ohio State shirt.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.820
And I’ve given my fair share of dirty looks to people wearing Ohio State stuff in Ann Arbor.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.840
How dare they, right?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.760
I think it’s time I get a blue and maize Google shirt.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.300
What say you, Google?
