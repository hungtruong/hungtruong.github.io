Yet Another Employment Announcement (And More Moving)

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:07.333
Published on May 09, 2012.

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:17.764
I wrote in my New Year’s Retrospective that my greatest fear for 2012 was that I would not get as much done as in previous years due to working a regular job for the first time in years.

00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:23.878
That concern turned out to be quite prescient as within a couple of months, things quickly changed.

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:34.048
While I enjoyed increasing my proficiency in Django and hanging out with cool co-workers, I found that I couldn’t break into areas that I was really interested in, specifically mobile.

00:00:34.548 --> 00:00:38.783
I decided to look for a new opportunity where I could grow as a mobile developer.

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:46.736
I’m happy to announce that I’ve accepted a new gig with Canopy (whose name is going to change soon), a spinoff of a company called LanguageMate.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:53.069
Canopy is based in Ann Arbor and specializes in language applications for medical professionals.

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:59.083
I’m working on a neat tool that helps nurses and doctors communicate with patients who might not speak the same language.

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:08.853
I think it’s an interesting space and presents a lot of interesting challenges in interface design, marketing, end user support, and other aspects that revolve around mobile development.

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:15.527
I believe this will be a better fit as I’m now able to work on a startup that is investing heavily in mobile.

00:01:16.027 --> 00:01:20.183
On top of that, I think it’s great that the app actually does something meaningful.

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:26.996
Sure, a photo sharing app might sell for a billion dollars, but has it ever saved a person’s life?

00:01:27.996 --> 00:01:30.153
Right now I’m in the middle of another move.

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:35.128
If all goes according to plan, I’ll be back in Ann Arbor (for the 4th time) on Friday.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:41.622
I’m looking forward to hanging out there again, spending more time with Emily, and eating at BTB every day.

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:47.896
I am really thankful for all the friends I made at Threadless, and I feel bad leaving them so soon.

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:54.629
Having said that, I am really looking forward to making a big impact at a small startup that really needs my skills.

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:58.485
Here’s to an interesting second half of 2012!
