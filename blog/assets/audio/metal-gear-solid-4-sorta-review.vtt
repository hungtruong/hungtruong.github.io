Metal Gear Solid 4: Sorta Review

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.020
Published on June 26, 2008.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.500
I pre-ordered MGS4 from Amazon.com and beat it over a weekend.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.360
While it was pretty cool and definitely displayed all the neat stuff you can do with the PS3, I felt like it was getting out of “MGS” territory.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.800
Metal Gear is supposed to be sneaking around and grabbing people, snapping their necks and stealing stuff from them.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.500
It’s about shooting their heads with so many tranquilizer darts that they look like the dude from Hellraiser.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.840
Basically, I think the Metal Gear Solid franchise peaked at around the end of the boat part of Metal Gear Solid 2.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.620
Don’t get me wrong, Metal Gear Solid 3 was also good.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.800
But it just felt like the series has been losing its original focus and going after too much, especially with the whole behind the back camera thing.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.840
Also, in terms of story continuity, the Metal Gear series has just gotten insane.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.100
I “sort of” understood what was going on after Metal Gear Solid 1.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:14.160
But after the insanity of #2 (with the entire game flipping out at the end when you find out you’re really just in a simulation or something) and the prequel hijinks of #3, it’s too much to handle and tie up in the final 4th iteration.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.100
There’s a downloadable encyclopedia that you can get on the PS3, but that thing would take forever to load!

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.660
I agree with the Beta-Waffle gu y that the boss battles seemed a bit contrived.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.000
In all the other games, you’re taking down an elite force of bad guys and you know you’re gonna fight them at some point.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.900
Remember in MGS1 when you were wondering exactly where Decoy Octopus was?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.720
In MGS4, you just kind of know that you have to fight these B&B chicks.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.580
And they don’t really have a back story until you’ve finished fighting them.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.000
And their back stories are dumb anyway.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.660
The bosses just turned out to be really generic and more tedious than anything.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.220
Finally, I just couldn’t get used to the controls.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.000
They’re so messed up!

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.340
You have to press R1 to aim, and R2 to shoot, but you need to press triangle to get to first person mode.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.680
When you’re in first person mode, you have about 0 mobility.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:18.060
So if a guy finds you and you need to shoot him, you go through a crazy set of button presses that will probably end up failing because he’ll shoot you first and you’ll just fall down.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.120
The controls just don’t work for the kind of FPS fighting that’s expected in some points.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.800
Having complained quite a bit, MGS4 still is a pretty neat achievement.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.420
The graphics are great.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.160
The story is epic (but makes no sense).

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.420
There’s lots of inside jokes referring to previous MGSes.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.840
But just like in the game itself, it looks like Snake’s job here is done.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.180
It’s time for him to take a vacation.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.640
At least we’ll always have the continue screen yelling.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.300
“Snake, what’s wrong? Snake? Can you hear me? SNAAAAAKKKKEEEEEEE!”
