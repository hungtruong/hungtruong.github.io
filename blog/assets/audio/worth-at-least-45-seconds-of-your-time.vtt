Worth At Least 45 Seconds of Your Time…

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:06.934
Published on March 28, 2010.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:11.690
Let’s see, how long has it been since I started a new blog?

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.827
Probably too long ago if I can’t remember.

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:18.943
My mom sends me insane attachments in emails.

00:00:19.443 --> 00:00:23.359
They’re usually collections of strange pictures and drug recall warnings.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.133
I have a theory that Asian ladies communicate primarily by sending Powerpoint presentations to each other.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:35.247
These emails are way too awesome to keep to myself, so I started a blog to document them.

00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:41.661
I called it “Worth 45 Seconds” because one it was included in the subject heading of one of my favorite emails.

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:45.277
You can see that one on Worth 45 Seconds .

00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:51.291
I’ll be adding more periodically as I sift through my backlog and as my mom keeps sending me new email forwards.
