Toby Dawson – My Olympic Doppleganger?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.140
Published on February 18, 2006.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.580
My sister and her husband came back from a trip to Florida today.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.120
While there, they watched a lot of the Olympics on TV.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.580
They found this guy that apparently looks like me.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.560
His name is Toby Dawson , and he won the Bronze medal in Men’s Moguls.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.800
That’s him on the left (with the Olympic medal, duh) and me on the right.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.260
I don’t really think that he looks that much like me.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.320
A less handsome (and delusional) me?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.820
Perhaps. So far in my family, my sister, her husband, and my mom think we look alike.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.720
My brother doesn’t think I look like him.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.520
So I leave it to you, the reader to decide.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.180
Here’s my first ever poll: Does Toby Dawson look like me?

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.680
Answer the binary yes or no.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.180
If you do vote, be sure and comment on why you voted for that choice.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.400
Results will be up… well, instantaneously.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.520
[poll=2]
