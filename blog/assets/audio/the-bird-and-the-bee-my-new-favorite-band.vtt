The Bird and The Bee – My New Favorite Band!

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:07.573
Published on February 21, 2010.

00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:12.089
I have been getting really into this band called “ The Bird and The Bee .”

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.706
They are composed of Inara George and Greg Kurstin.

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:19.003
I’m not sure which one is The Bird and which one is The Bee.

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:21.580
Or if it’s just a band name.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.838
I bet they get asked that a lot.

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:29.293
I’m guessing that Inara is the bee, because almost all bees (the worker ones) are female.

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:31.551
Anyway, what was I writing about?

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:35.747
My music-listening tendencies have been pretty unfocused recently.

00:00:36.247 --> 00:00:38.644
I just kinda try out whatever music I hear about.

00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:45.617
The last artist I sorta latched onto was Ingrid Michaelson after seeing her in concert in Ann Arbor back in 2007.

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:49.873
I listened to some Andrew Bird but didn’t get super into him or anything.

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:57.006
The Bird and The Bee is the first band whose albums I am listening to over and over again, and getting really psyched about.

00:00:57.506 --> 00:01:00.463
I even bought their single to hear some new songs.

00:01:00.963 --> 00:01:02.481
How crazy is that!?

00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:07.157
I will now recount how I first became acquainted with this band.

00:01:07.657 --> 00:01:11.173
I am not ashamed to admit this is a very “ Stuff White People Like ” story.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:15.109
I was at The Gap, trying on some clothes in the fitting room.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.406
Then I heard this song that sounded pretty neat.

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:22.102
So I used Shazam to figure out what it was.

00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:25.000
It turns out it was “You’re a Cad.”

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.333
This happened on November 29th, 2009 at exactly 1:51pm Pacific Time.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:34.550
Thanks for the extreme data accuracy, Shazam!

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.904
Anyway, I made a mental note to check out the band, after purchasing a cheap sweater.

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:45.719
I actually don’t remember if I bought a sweater, but details make a story more interesting.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:52.533
I put a few of their albums on hold at the Seattle Public Library and loaded them onto my iPhone to listen to on my commute to work.

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.231
The rest is history.

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:59.946
The Bird and The Bee is probably so interesting to me because they have such a unique sound.

00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:08.118
Their website describes them as a mix of “Brazilian Tropicalia, 60s psychedelic pop, and sparse electronic beats.”

00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:14.372
Inara has a wispy yet super-focused voice that really adds a lot to the complex arrangements.

00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:18.968
To say that their “sound” truly defines them would be a disservice, though.

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:24.102
In addition to a neat sound, their songs stand out because they’re really well composed.

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:30.356
I think a lot of current alternative music focuses on the ambience, and not a whole lot on a coherent melody.

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:40.526
The Bird and The Bee’s music not only contains some neat melodies, they also do some fun things like layering melodies on top of each other, making canon-ish things happen.

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:43.823
Their songs actually start somewhere and build up to something.

00:02:44.323 --> 00:02:49.277
Maybe I’m just being a fanboy, but I really appreciate the songwriting skills of the duo.

00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:53.873
At this point in the post, I should really just let you listen to their music.

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:58.689
Here’s one of their songs along with a music video: Polite Dance Song.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.784
The concept of the song is wacky and the video fits it quite well.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:08.180
They also have an awesome cover of How Deep is Your Love on the single that I got .

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.515
Oh, and a wacky song about a weeaboo’s love for Japan .

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:18.790
The Bird and The Bee have a new album coming out, apparently a tribute album to Hall and Oates !

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.365
I should probably just pre-order this as I’ve liked everything else they’ve put out so far.
