Hung Truong: Threadless Model!

00:00:03.658 --> 00:00:06.295
Published on December 27, 2010.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:12.489
Last week I took a train out to visit Chicago for a meeting with my favorite company, Threadless!

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:19.222
Since I wrote that app I’ve been in contact with the founder et al, and they thought it would be cool for me to check out their offices.

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:27.314
I won’t talk about what discussions went on (I’m being held by a “ frieNd-DA “), but I can say that the Threadless office is mega sweet!

00:00:28.314 --> 00:00:36.146
I got to hang out with some of the developers on Threadless and talked about the site and other random stuff (like t-shirt quality through the ages).

00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:41.360
I pointed out something that actually ended up being a bug that one of the dudes fixed almost immediately!

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.219
Talk about transparency.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.714
At some point we were talking about how the Threadless t-shirt models are picked.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:53.728
Ivan (super nice guy) mentioned that the photographer might be looking for someone to model a shirt.

00:00:54.228 --> 00:01:01.341
He ended up replying and I got to model a brand new Threadless shirt in the cold, cold December Chicago air.

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:04.078
The shirt’s called …To The Birds .

00:01:04.578 --> 00:01:05.617
Buy it today!

00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:09.414
The Threadless office itself is pretty nice.

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:13.989
They moved in relatively recently so it still looks a little bare.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:17.366
Apparently they have big plans for decorating.

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:24.499
I was, once again, super star struck by seeing people who I feel I know very well through their pictures on the Threadless site.

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:31.152
I met the beard guy, Red the dog (I think it’s a Shiba Inu) and other assorted celebrities.

00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:38.525
One of the developers I met was the guy in the Mr Tee photo and another was Mario in another shirt (I couldn’t figure out which one).

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:43.340
Oh, and I said hi to Colleen and Kristen, who I first met at SXSW !

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.856
They let me go down to the warehouse and pick out some shirts to take home.

00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:53.470
It kind of took all the willpower in my being not to clean them out (they probably would not have let me).

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.087
I got Upso , Mister Mittens and Houndstooth .

00:01:57.587 --> 00:02:03.500
I also got a cool I ♥ Threadless shirt that they don’t really sell anymore. Limited edition!

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.613
This is probably already obvious, but Threadless is an awesome place with some awesome people making awesome things (mostly shirts).

00:02:12.113 --> 00:02:16.668
I had a blast meeting the people behind it and I hope I can come back again really soon!
