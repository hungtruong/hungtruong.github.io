Funny Google Adsense Typo

00:00:04.617 --> 00:00:07.573

00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:11.130
I saw this on my Adsense page just now.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:19.782
I thought “Customer Search” was some kind of new feature where I could do a search for potential customers (advertisers) or maybe create a special search for customers.

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:23.898
After clicking on it, it just takes me to the custom search page.

00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:28.314
So I think they meant “Custom Search” but someone typed “Customer Search” instead.

00:00:28.814 --> 00:00:37.045
This is funny (probably only to me) because it makes me think there might be three levels: Custom Search, Customer Search and Customest Search.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.981
Maybe there’s also a Customestest Search available after that.
