An Important Announcement About My Employment Status (And T-Shirts)

00:00:05.256 --> 00:00:07.733
Published on September 15, 2011.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:16.325
If you know me or if you read my blog, you know that I have been a huge fan of Threadless since I first found out about it in 2005 .

00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:20.900
For a while, Threadless was pretty much the only thing I wrote about on this blog .

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.293
Last year, I developed an unofficial mobile app for browsing and sharing cool Threadless designs on the iPhone and iPad .

00:00:28.793 --> 00:00:32.949
This caught the attention of Threadless and I got to visit their sweet office !

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:40.022
I had the chance to visit again for the Threadless Family Reunion and an interview of sorts, and I was offered a job!

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:44.278
I am happy to announce that I will join Threadless at the beginning of October.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:52.071
I am really looking forward to making Threadless even more awesome (and now from the inside as opposed to hacking together an API for myself)!
