So I Moved To Ann Arbor…

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.300
Published on September 10, 2007.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.420
Just to get that out of the way… Also, I’ve just started getting back into my usual routine.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.000
Which consists of napping, waking up groggy, reading blogs, and even writing in my personal blog!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Notes since the last post:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.240
Meijer is pronounced “ Meyer ” and not “ Major .”

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.640
Kroger is like identical to Smiths

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.920
Dreyer’s ice cream is called Edy’s for some strange reason.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.000
Moving into an apartment from scratch requires buying a LOT OF SHIT!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.480
My new microwave is really high maintenance.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.260
Which is to say that it gets mad when I forget there’s hot food in it.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.660
The Michigan Football team sucks.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.560
Is this bizarro Ann Arbor!?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.720
I have to do laundry with coins now.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.020
So getting a quarter is about as ceremonious (and awesome) as getting a Shine in Mario .

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.380
More later, unless I forget the password to this blog.
