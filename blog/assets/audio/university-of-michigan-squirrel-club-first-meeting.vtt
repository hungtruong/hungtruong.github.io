University of Michigan Squirrel Club: First Meeting

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.860
Published on September 30, 2007.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.540
Walking around the University of Michigan, I see a lot of people.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.000
And I’m really into shirts if you didn’t know already.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.380
So this combination leads to me seeing a lot of people and noticing their shirts.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:30.340
A common “genre” of shirt here is a blue shirt with “maize” words that say “Michigan _ _ _” with “Michigan” being on top, and the other word(s) being below it.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.400
So for example if you were a law student, you might wear a shirt that said “Michigan Law.”

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.140
They’re basically available for all majors, minors, and anything else you might think of.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.260
I surmised that it would be fun to have parody shirts.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.960
Ideas I thought up, along with Adam Torres (the guy who likes being mentioned in blogs) were “Michigan Culinary,” “Michigan Blacksmith,” and “Michigan Undeclared.”

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.340
But then I walked around and saw someone with a “Michigan Squirrels” shirt and figured they had beaten me to the punch.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.620
It turns out there’s a Michigan Squirrel Club that meets every Sunday at 4pm at the grad library steps.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.080
Their main mission is to feed squirrels peanuts.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.700
And they do it pretty well.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.120
There’s a squirrel call that they use to summon squirrels, and several advanced techniques like tree feeding and squirrel fishing.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.400
I attended my first meeting today and fed some squirrels.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.020
The squirrels seem to be a bit wary at first, but after a while they became more bold, even running up to us to demand a peanut.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.960
I talked with the creator and ex-president, Jason, who is also a fellow SI student.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.300
He says people are always asking about the club, and sure enough, when we were feeding squirrels, people kept on coming up to us and talking.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.180
I’m not sure how often I can make the squirrel club meetings, but I’d say it’s a fairly cool club.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.120
Also, not to brag, but the website is pretty damn bitchin’.
