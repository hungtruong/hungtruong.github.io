00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:07.253

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:10.731
I just got this ad while shopping at Amazon.

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:14.507
This is an ad targeting failure for a number of reasons.

00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:18.304
I am using Chrome, which is better than IE8

00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:22.900
I am on a MacBook Pro, which isn’t even supported by IE8

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:31.932
I went ahead and clicked on the link for the lulz.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:38.665
I ended up getting to this strange terms page with a bunch of links to download the software for different (Windows) operating systems.

00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:41.562
How bad of a user experience is that!?

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:49.115

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:50.414
Too bad for them.

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:54.111
At least they have an ad feedback box for me to mock them with:
