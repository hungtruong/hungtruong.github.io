Google, Bing, and SERP Copying: Additional Evidence?

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.973
Published on April 06, 2011.

00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:20.881
In the beginning of February this year there was some mild uproar about Google setting up an elaborate sting operation against Bing to prove that Bing was copying search results pages directly from Google using the Bing Toolbar.

00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.657
I personally thought it was a bit childish of Google to do this.

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:28.433
All’s fair in gathering user-generated data, right?

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.511
Fast forward to a few weeks ago.

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:38.963
I put some code on Mapskrieg that would auto-detect a mobile device using the useragent string and show a mobile friendly site.

00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:43.299
I thought this was clever, but apparently Google thought it was cloaking.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:44.758
Oops! My bad.

00:00:45.258 --> 00:00:47.655
I took a hit on my Google search rankings.

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:52.550
Once I fixed the issue my hits from Google have been coming back up slowly.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.464
I looked at Google Analytics to see how the organic search referrals had changed, and I noticed something interesting.

00:00:59.964 --> 00:01:04.998
Not only had the referrals from Google gone down, the ones from Yahoo and Bing did as well.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:11.412
Perhaps Yahoo and Bing noticed the “cloaking” behavior, too (Yahoo is just using Bing results in their SERPs now).

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:14.709
If so, then Bing was a bit slower than Google.

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.887
See the charts below:

00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:21.323
I started getting punished by Google around the 15th of March.

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:26.778
Bing seems to have taken a few days to lower my rankings (and thus the # of clicks).

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:35.029
My website’s recovery from punishment shows a similar upward trend, even though the site was no longer “cloaking” for about a week before that recovery.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:40.324
This suggests (at least, to me) that Bing really is copying Google’s search results pages.

00:01:40.824 --> 00:01:53.611
Otherwise they have a very similar method of cloaking detection, a similar policy for punishment, and a similar timeline for reducing the punishment for cloaking… At this point I feel that there are too many coincidences for this to be mere chance.

00:01:54.611 --> 00:02:01.084
I was previously on Bing’s side because I figured that the Google data was just one data point out of many that they use.

00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:07.897
This example makes it seem like Google’s data is THE data point, or at least a major, major part of their “algorithm.”

00:02:08.897 --> 00:02:15.930
Having stated all of this, my experience is only a sample size of 1, but I’m sure other webmasters have similar data sitting around.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.345
I’d be interested in seeing if there’s more evidence for Google’s stance.

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:29.796
If I were Google, I’d be analyzing data from Google Analytics on other websites to see if they agree (I have a feeling they’re allowed to use this data anonymously).

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:38.148
Full Disclosure (because why not?): I used to work for Microsoft AdCenter, but I haven’t been involved with their operations for over a year now.

00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:44.721
I have a can of Bing soda water on my shelf but I mostly use Google (unless I want to use Bing ironically).

00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.957
Edit: I’ve gotten some really great comments from Hacker News.

00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:53.733
I thought I’d paraphrase a few and write my comments on them.

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:57.749
If you want to see the actual comments, go directly to my submission .

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.665
Comment : How could Bing get SERP info from just the toolbar?

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:13.015
My response : 1) My site drops from many SERP listings, Bing Toolbar stops getting click info for my site so the listings drop from Bing as well.

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:16.972
Comment : It might not be cloaking punishment.

00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:24.744
It could just be an outside factor, like people generally searching for the site’s keywords less or a competitor coming in and being better.

00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:32.217
My response : The traffic to Mapskrieg is pretty darn regular and this was a significant drop for both search engines.

00:03:32.717 --> 00:03:38.630
Through trial and error the only thing that changed my rankings back was fixing the user agent thing.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.503
Comment : Google suggested that the changes to SERPs took months to propagate and this data only took about a day.

00:03:47.503 --> 00:03:50.140
My response : Okay, that’s a good point!

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.615
The response from Hacker News has been great and really made me think more about the issue.

00:03:56.115 --> 00:04:01.709
I’m not sure if Bing really is copying from Google, but I thought this was a worthwhile data point to look at.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.325
Maybe someone else has some data they’d like to share as well.
