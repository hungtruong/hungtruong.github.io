Pownce: Beta Impressions

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.900
Published on July 18, 2007.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.260
I got a Pownce invite today ( Thanks Jessica !) and finally got a chance to try out the hot beta.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.720
Unfortunately I couldn’t actually get any of my uploads to work…

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.400
While the site is pretty nice looking and slick, if the functionality doesn’t work, it’s useless.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.380
I think it could actually be somewhat useful for sharing files with a select group of friends.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.560
Like “hey, I like this song, check it out” and bam!

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.760
Then again, you could do that by email, but email is SOOOOO 1999!

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.180
Actually, email’s more like 1979, but you get the idea.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.040
If only Pownce worked… The worst part is that it’s a beta product, but there’s no way to report a bug besides using (wait for it…) email.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.060
How ironic, indeed.
