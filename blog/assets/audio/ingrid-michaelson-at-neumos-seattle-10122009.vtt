Ingrid Michaelson at Neumos, Seattle 10/12/2009

00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:08.532
Published on October 13, 2009.

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:13.448
I got to see Ingrid Michaelson in concert at Neumos in Seattle last night.

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:17.783
I previously saw her for the first time in Ann Arbor, 2007 .

00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:23.078
Unfortunately, I didn’t get to see her in Ann Arbor last year because she sold out pretty quickly.

00:00:24.078 --> 00:00:34.308
From what I remember of the last time I saw her (I haven’t re-read my other concert post yet), she seemed really modest and was excited that people in the audience knew the words to some of her songs.

00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:40.801
After two years of success, it seems like she’s a lot more confident, but also kind of diva-ish.

00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:45.856
Not that she’s a bitch or anything, but she’s sort of less charming in the way she was before.

00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:54.347
She still mentioned lots of random stuff like crying a bunch after watching The Family Stone on the tour bus and how much they like all like Mexican food.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:01:00.222
Before Ingrid and the band came on, there was an opening act guy named Matthew Perryman Jones.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:03.759
I wonder if it’s his real name or a fake stage name!

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.615
He was pretty good, but his songs were kind of yawn-inducing.

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:13.709
He was nice though, and he said that all proceeds of the music and shirts and stuff would go to a child in need.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.846
Then he revealed the child in need is his child!

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:18.544
What a joker.

00:01:19.544 --> 00:01:27.056
Ingrid and the gang came on kind of late, and started with Soldier, which is the opener of her new album, Everybody , which I haven’t written about yet.

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:30.753
Then she played a mix of songs from her past three albums.

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:39.804
The first time I saw her, she only brought her friend Allie, but this time she had a full band, which is kind of necessary for playing a lot of the arrangements in the new album.

00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:43.500
The older songs felt a little weird with a full band though.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.070
To be fair, some of the arrangements were refreshing, like Far Away turned into a much richer song and I think Giving Up almost turned into a country song, which had an awesome effect.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.565
This is exactly why live performances are worthwhile to plunk down change for.

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:02.442
Ingrid said she was tired because she had taken a nap.

00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:03.901
I can relate.

00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:07.517
It’s hard to get back on track after taking an hour nap.

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:09.536
She sounded fine, though.

00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:12.113
Her voice was as nice as I remember it.

00:02:12.613 --> 00:02:15.890
There were times that she used a little too much vibrato though.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.867
But she’s totally still got it talent-wise.

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:22.424
I think her songwriting has gotten better as well.

00:02:22.924 --> 00:02:25.002
I really like Die Alone, don’t get me wrong.

00:02:25.502 --> 00:02:27.499
But it’s just a little too repetitive.

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.157
Her new songs are much better in that sense.

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:35.232
Oh, also, when she sang Can’t Help Falling in Love, some girl fainted.

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:37.810
And she said it happened the previous night, too!

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.828
Maybe it’s an epidemic.

00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:46.242
Or maybe people just know they can get Ingrid to come to their rescue and get close to her by pretending to faint during that song…

00:02:47.242 --> 00:02:50.997
Overall, I think Ingrid Michaelson has improved quite a lot.

00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:56.772
The lacking maturity factor that I wrote about in my previous posts seems to have resolved itself.

00:02:57.272 --> 00:02:59.269
Maybe is a really good album.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.404
And Ingrid is a really good performer (and so are her bandmates, especially Allie).

00:03:04.904 --> 00:03:07.781
Oh, and her other girl guitar player is kind of cute.

00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:11.477
So go see her live if she hasn’t already sold out in your town!

00:03:11.977 --> 00:03:14.934
Apparently she has sold out everywhere she’s gone so far.

00:03:15.434 --> 00:03:20.309
Hopefully I will get to see Ingrid again some time soon without a skip year like before!
