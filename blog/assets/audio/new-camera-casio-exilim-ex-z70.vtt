I got a new camera: the Casio Exilim EX-Z70.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.600
It was only $150 at Best Buy, which was a pretty good bargain.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.660
Since I was over at UNM yesterday, I decided to take a few test shots.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.640
They’re mostly okay, but somewhat grainy when seen at full resolution.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.540
This should probably be a 6 megapixel camera, not a 7.2…

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.140
Anyway, the video quality is fairly good.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.360
Better than my old Canon S50, at least.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.160
Youtube video quality kinda sucks, so here it is in lower compression:
