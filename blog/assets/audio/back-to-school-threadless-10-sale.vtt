Back To School Threadless $10 Sale!

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.940
Published on August 16, 2006.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.300
Whoa, so like, right after I say I want a threadless.com $10 sale they make one!

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.200
And this time, they released 6 shirts each on Monday, Tuesday, and Today.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.600
There was a cool dinosaur shirt on Monday that I wanted, but it’s sold out already.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.860
That was way fast.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.760
I was hoping there’d be some good ones later on and I’d buy em all in one order.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.180
That didn’t really work out.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.700
Right now, the only shirts I’d buy are probably the Ctrl+Z reprint (since my other one(s) are already fading) and the Ambition Killed the Cat one.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.320
It’s so cute!

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.100
Ask me how I became a Pirate is also kind of cool.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.980
Afternoon Delight is surprisingly still in stock.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.840
I’d buy it, but I’m not too sure the world is ready for me to wear a shirt with two unicorns copulating on it.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.560
I need to buff up my Fall wardrobe, so I guess it’s a good excuse as any to buy a bunch of new t-shirts!

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.020
Oh, the Sale ends Monday(8/21) morning, so hurry up and buy some shirts !
