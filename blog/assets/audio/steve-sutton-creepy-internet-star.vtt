So a while back, I found some videos from a guy doing a daily video journal type thing.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.320
His name is Steve Sutton, and his life seems really really boring.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.180
Steve speaks in this weird creepy southern accent and just mentions the mundane stuff that happens to him.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.200
Visiting Steve’s World , you can see he’s pretty busy on the internet.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.200
At first I thought the guy was just some kind of geniusly crafted alter ego.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.220
A lot of his videos involve post production (like him visiting himself from the future and talking to himself).

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.560
The more I watch his videos, though, the more I think he’s actually a creepy guy.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.000
Here’s a video of him talking about eating boiled peanuts .

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.980
So is he really creepy or fake creepy?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.680
You be the judge!
