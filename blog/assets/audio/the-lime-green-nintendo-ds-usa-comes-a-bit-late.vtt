The Lime Green Nintendo DS (USA) Comes A Bit Late…

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:09.411
Published on April 25, 2009.

00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.409
Warning: Be prepared for a rant.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.925
I just learned that Nintendo is releasing a lime green DS .

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:20.462
The thing I’ve wanted ever since I learned of the DS.

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:25.357
I have a lime green Gameboy color and a lime green Gameboy Advance.

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:28.414
Lime green is my favorite color ever.

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:33.549
Left to my own devices (which I have been), everything I buy is lime green.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:40.282
Basically when I wear my backpack, jacket, shoes, hat, etc, I look like a ninja turtle.

00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:43.099
This is just some context.

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:46.976
I just got the DSi like a week or two ago.

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:48.675
It’s really nice.

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:55.887
Not that much different from a DS but it has some interesting features like the cameras and new software.

00:00:56.387 --> 00:01:02.461
I figured I’d buy the DSi when it came out and then if it was ever released in lime green, I’d get that one.

00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:06.157
Because I’m a sucker and I gladly pay the Nintendo tax.

00:01:07.157 --> 00:01:12.431
Anyway, now I find out that the lime green DS I’ve coveted since forever is a reality!

00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:22.042
RIGHT AFTER I BUY THE DSi!!! Interestingly, my emotions are a combination of rage, acceptance and really wanting to buy the lime green DS anyway.

00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:24.540
I wish I knew how to quit you, Nintendo.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.357
I WISH I KNEW HOW TO QUIT YOU!

00:01:28.357 --> 00:01:30.834
Also, this one looks like it’s for moms.

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:35.969
Does that say something about my taste in video game console colors? Hmm…
