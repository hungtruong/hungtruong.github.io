Firefox 2 RC1 Impressions

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.020
Published on September 26, 2006.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.340
So today, Firefox 2.0 RC1 got released!

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.360
Sick of seeing Firefox take 500Mb of ram, I upgraded.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.580
I figured that if it’s good enough to be a candidate for release, it’s good enough for me.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.740
So far, things are going okay.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.440
The browser’s been open for a few hours now and it’s only (!?) taking up 100Mb of ram.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.620
I’ve got 6 tabs open.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.440
If this were the older version, I’m pretty sure we’d be at around 500. No joke.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.200
Firefox seems to be less sluggish, which is good.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.620
The visual theme has also been updated to look more shiny and glossy.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.240
I’ve also discovered that there’s an integrated spellchecker that works its magic on any textarea.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.660
Pretty awesome. I can’t wait for Firefox 2.0 to officially be released.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.280
Then, and only then, can I get a Firefox 2.0 t-shirt to commemorate the occasion.
