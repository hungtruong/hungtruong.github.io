iRobot Roomba 530: Review!

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:06.454
Published on November 30, 2009.

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:10.012
I brought home a bundle of joy yesterday.

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:13.548
No, I did not adopt a child or animal.

00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:18.683
But I do have a new pet: the iRobot Roomba 530 vacuum-cleaning robot!

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:21.601
I’ve wanted a Roomba for a while.

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:25.137
It makes perfect sense: it’s a robot, which I love.

00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:28.274
It’s a vacuum cleaner, which I also really like.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.373
It’s also kind of a pet.

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:34.469
I have to say that the way it moves around is pretty cute.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.286
There are really nice, nuanced touches.

00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:41.222
Like how it beeps as it backs up when it leaves its docking station.

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:44.998
Or how it slows down a bit when it knows it’s gonna hit the wall.

00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:47.256
And it hits the wall a lot.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:51.352
It also plays a sort of sad sound when it runs out of batteries.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.010
The Roomba definitely has a personality.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.044
In addition to just being a cool nerdy object, the Roomba does a pretty decent job.

00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:03.901
It picked up a bunch of gunk the first time it swept through my apartment.

00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:08.156
It seemed to prefer the living room, maybe because it was dirtiest?

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:11.453
Or maybe because it liked the feel of the shag rug.

00:01:11.953 --> 00:01:13.152
I’m not sure.

00:01:13.652 --> 00:01:18.047
The algorithm that determines where the Roomba goes seems non-deterministic.

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:29.895
So it ends up doing something different each time, but I think the algorithm also ensures that it hits all the spots a couple of times, and it apparently knows when it’s found some dirt, in which case it goes back for more.

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:33.672
There are some really nice details about the design of the robot.

00:01:34.172 --> 00:01:37.368
It’s circular, which means it can turn with a 0 degree radius.

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:41.384
It has a rotating brush thingy that helps it get stuff that’s in a corner.

00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:44.761
It’s also pretty short, so it fits under my couch and my bed.

00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:49.816
It’s only gotten stuck like once, and that was an edge case where it used a table leg as a ramp.

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:52.894
So far I am very happy with my Roomba.

00:01:53.394 --> 00:01:56.910
It’s cute, functional and gives some serious nerd cred.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.924
I realize that it’s only a matter of time before my Roomba gains sentience and tries to kill me in my sleep.

00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:07.659
For now, though, it’s worth saving the trouble of having to vacuum by hand all the time.
