Yep, I found one in my Japanese listening homework today.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.080
The lady says:

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:22.000
自分にしか責任を負ってこなかったの (eh? Jibun ni shika kattekonakatta no?)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.800
Which I think means: “Eh? You only bought it for yourself?” (the subject was gifts)

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.040
Not only is this hard to say, but the Japanese person saying it just blazes through it!

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.420
And I had to figure it out from listening, not from reading it!

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.280
Listen for yourself:

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.680
I guess it’s harder to understand if you’re doing listening homework, and you don’t know the Japanese that she’s saying.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.700
I’m going to go ahead and say it’s my new favorite Japanese tounge twister!

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.920
Next to basugasubakuhatsu, of course…
