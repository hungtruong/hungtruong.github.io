The Fantastic Plastic Machine – The Guy

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.860
While I was waiting for the plane to board in the Oakland airport a few days ago, I was messing around with my Macbook.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.680
I tried getting an internet connection, but the stupid airport (the actual airport I was in, not the wireless card on my Macbook) wanted me to pay for it.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.980
Oh, they let me check out the Oakland Airport website , though.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.400
But that’s not interesting.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.560
Anyway, I opened iTunes and started listening to a podcast I had saved.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.260
Some business podcast that had a guy talking about Google.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.360
He was supposed to have an insider’s scoop, but what he gave was a super high-level description of things that I already pretty much understood before.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.800
Then I noticed that there was something in the “shared music” section.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.300
I guess the airport still allowed me to get on some kind of local area network.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.280
So I was listening to this dude’s shared music (something like, Hernando Fernandez or something, I forgot his name).

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.500
A lot of it was R&B or random electronica.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.680
One of the artists that caught my ear was named The Fantastic Plastic Machine .

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.720
I listened to a few songs before I had to start boarding.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.260
I wrote down the name of the artist for future reference though.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.160
Funny: apparently FPM is a Japanese j-pop-ish artist.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.020
So when I listen to music blindly, I choose J-Pop.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.960
It’s a bit different, though.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.880
Some now defunct company published some FPM stuff a while back.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.580
I wonder if it’d be legit to download some of the music?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:45.600
Otherwise I’d have to buy some out of print CDs or import… Anyway, I thought it was pretty neat to be able to discover a new artist through the kindness of a random Oakland Airport guy. Thanks!
