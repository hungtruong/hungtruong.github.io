Google Play Vs. iTunes Match

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:06.135
Published on March 13, 2012.

00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:11.210
I signed up for the Google Music beta a while ago and promptly forgot about it.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.706
I was either too busy to check it out or unimpressed with the feature set.

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:20.121
I recently took another look at it after it was renamed to “Google Play.”

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.898
It’s suddenly making a bit more sense now that I’m trying it out again.

00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:30.651
Google Play (I’m really just talking about the music part) lets you upload all of your music to Google’s servers.

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:37.544
This step seems kind of dumb but I guess for legal reasons they can’t just recognize your music and use their own copies of songs.

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:40.362
I’m sure they’ve got the technology to do it.

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:44.778
Anyway, once your music is uploaded you can play it from “the cloud.”

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:50.072
While this seems like something so simple that Dropbox could do it, it’s the details that matter.

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:56.006
In this case, Google offers a pretty neat interface to listen to your music (and buy more, if desired).

00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:02.280
I haven’t used iTunes Match personally, but from what I’ve read, it seems to do something similar.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.215
iTunes Match will scan your music library and “match” them up with songs in their database.

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:14.548
If a song isn’t on your iPhone but is in your library, you can download and listen to it from your device.

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:22.640
So far, it doesn’t seem like there’s a desktop component of iTunes Match besides iTunes (meaning you can’t listen from a website).

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.537
Also, iTunes Match costs money.

00:01:26.537 --> 00:01:34.129
What I like about Google Play is that there is a web interface, so I can listen to all of my music at work without having to download iTunes.

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:44.139
I complained earlier on Twitter about how there isn’t a native app for iOS that lets you listen to your Google Play stuff, but there does happen to be a web based player that seems okay.

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:51.752
iTunes integrates more easily with your library (no need to actually upload stuff) but seems more rigid about re-downloading music.

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:56.028
Overall, it seems like Google Play is the better service.

00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:59.884
If it had a native app for iOS it would be the clear winner.

00:02:00.384 --> 00:02:08.376
Eventually I would like to lower the amount of space on my phone that I’m using for music, which would allow me to have more apps, photos and videos.

00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:14.310
Hopefully the two services continue to develop and compete with each other to the point where they’re both improving.
