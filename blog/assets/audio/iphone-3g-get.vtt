iPhone 3G GET!!!!

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.580
Published on July 11, 2008.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.820
So after a few false starts, I have an iPhone 3G that works.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.820
The journey was a long one; at the end I grew weary and lost faith.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.440
But finally, I have a neat iPhone 3G that does cool stuff.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.920
It started this morning at around 5:30.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:32.140
I woke up (though I only got like, 3 hours of sleep since I had taken a nap earlier and messed up my sleep cycle) and took a quick shower.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.200
No breakfast. Just took a vitamin water (these things are kinda good!) and a coffee granola bar for energy.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.040
Gaurav (from Troubadour Mobile ) picked Adam (also from Troubadour Mobile ) and I up.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.180
We drove to the mall and saw a bunch of peeps.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.720
We also saw some officemates from CampusRoost (yes, that’s a slick mention!).

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.340
They told us that the AT&T store on Liberty had like, zero people and we should go there.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.020
When we actually got to the AT&T store, it was around 6:30ish.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.160
There were actually about 30 people in line.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.260
Apparently everyone showed up around 6:15 or so.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.160
There was a really cool line wrangler named Steve that kept everyone reasonably informed.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.220
We found out there were like, 40 phones.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.640
So we should be able to get one.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.340
Adam and Brent didn’t want to settle for white ones.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.440
Or 8GB ones.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.580
But I think eventually Adam got a black 8GB and I dunno what Brent did.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.180
At 8am, the line started moving, and it was moving well.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.360
But then disaster struck!

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.300
It seems either Apple or AT&T didn’t have the resources to take a billion people in the US all wanting iPhones at the same time (and having to activate them in the store).

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.560
The activations were apparently taking around 45-50 minutes each when they should’ve taken 15 or so.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.480
Eventually, the AT&T people let us just do most of the steps in store and then activate at home.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.260
By the time we were done, it was about 11am.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.360
I went home and tried to activate the thing for about 15 minutes.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.260
iTunes was just being bad.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.800
So I went to sleep.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.420
I woke up at around 2pm and tried to activate again.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.200
This time it worked after about 30 minutes of trying.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.600
I’ve been loading up apps and trying them out.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.620
It’s pretty cool.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.520
My favorite so far is the PhoneSaber.
