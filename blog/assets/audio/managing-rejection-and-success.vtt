Managing Rejection (And Success!)

00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:05.975
Published on March 04, 2009.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:11.690
Over the past few years, I’ve found myself in a number of situations where I’ve been rejected.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.663
I read an article via BoingBoing on why some people see failure as crippling, while others see it as a motivator .

00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:20.521
Pretty interesting stuff.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.339
I have the book on hold at the library.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.633
I guess I fall into the latter category as I haven’t really let my numerous failures drag me down.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:35.707
When I was fresh out of college (for the first time), I got an amazing opportunity to interview at Google.

00:00:36.207 --> 00:00:40.682
If you were a CS major in 2006, Google was pretty much the holy grail.

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:45.896
In my mind, it definitely was (well, maybe second to Facebook, but they never got back to me).

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:50.232
Like many of my adventures, I wrote about this in a blog post .

00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:53.390
Long story short, I was rejected.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.365
I think at that point I was a bit cocky and thought Google was a sure thing.

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:03.500
You should never have a sense of entitlement; that leads down a pretty depressing path.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.514
Getting rejected was a good wake-up call that I needed to improve myself if I wanted to end up with my dream job.

00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:13.210
At the time I thought I had missed an amazing opportunity.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.345
This may have been true; I’ll never know what my life would be like if I had started working at Google.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:22.281
Looking back, though, I think the rejection was really a blessing.

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:29.275
Maybe the reason I’ve been able to rebound from rejections in the past was that they’ve always been balanced with acceptances.

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:32.571
At the same time, I was looking at grad schools.

00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:37.647
Rejection after rejection (after rejection after rejection ) came in.

00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:41.183
But luckily there was a acceptance as well.

00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:44.800
And it was the school I wanted to go to the most , with full funding !

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.711
During the time between my graduation (and Google rejection) and the start of grad school, I had some fun making random web apps like MapsKrieg .

00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:58.926
This actually led to an opportunity for me to work with a startup called LiveByCampus.

00:01:59.426 --> 00:02:01.024
It was a pretty neat experience.

00:02:01.524 --> 00:02:04.721
Who knows, it might also lead to another opportunity some day.

00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:10.436
In grad school, I had a lot of fun trying to get internships at companies I thought were really cool.

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:14.771
And since I was developing all these new skills, I’d get hired for sure, right?

00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:18.228
Okay, I actually tried to be a bit more humble this time around.

00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:30.236
For a while, I was very successful in replicating my previous results of being rejected by Facebook , Microsoft , Apple , Zazzle and a number of other companies that didn’t even bother replying to me to tell me I was rejected.

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:33.373
I guess I was sorta in a slump again.

00:02:34.373 --> 00:02:41.326
Then I was selected (along with my teammates Adam and Gaurav) by RPM Ventures to start a company over last Summer.

00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:46.860
I realize I haven’t really written much about Troubadour Mobile (our website is very outdated) on my blog.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.878
Perhaps I should.

00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:56.011
To make a long story short, however, Troubadour Mobile turned out to be the best possible internship I could’ve had.

00:02:57.011 --> 00:03:05.003
Sidenote: There’s this psychological idea that people will look back at events and see that what ended up happening was the best thing that could’ve happened.

00:03:05.503 --> 00:03:08.060
I read about this in Stumbling on Happiness .

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.955
In some cases, people who lost limbs ended up saying it was the best thing to ever happen to them.

00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:17.690
I don’t think I’m showing this behavior here, but I acknowledge that I could be. End sidenote.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.606
At Troubdour Mobile I had an awesome experience in entrepreneurship.

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:25.184
We started an actual company.

00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:27.282
We got stock certificates!

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:29.620
We paid taxes this year!

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.718
We printed t-shirts!

00:03:32.218 --> 00:03:34.855
We didn’t, however, get business cards.

00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:39.750
I guess we were too busy writing an awesome prototype application for the iPhone!

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.286
I learned a great deal at Troubadour and had a blast.

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:52.438
While I was very happy with the company, I wasn’t sure if I could take the plunge and attempt to live off of a scantily funded student startup after graduation.

00:03:52.938 --> 00:03:56.054
So I once again began looking for other opportunities.

00:03:56.554 --> 00:04:02.628
And I still found myself with some rejection (isn’t there some kind of three-strike rule for getting rejected by Facebook?).

00:04:03.128 --> 00:04:05.285
But I had much better luck this time.

00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:11.139
I think that the Troubadour Mobile experience had a lot to do with it, but I’m not entirely sure.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:23.627
I successfully interviewed at Orbitz in Chicago (great company and city, btw) and then at Microsoft in Seattle (also a great company (and city), despite what I’ve written previously in this blog, hahaha! ).

00:04:24.627 --> 00:04:26.865
And so I find myself here in the present.

00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:30.881
I’m finishing up grad school and will be graduating in May.

00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:34.817
I’ll be starting as a Program Manager at Microsoft in September.

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:42.189
Hopefully I’ll have some time off over the Summer to chill (I’m also going to SXSW with Troubadour Mobile in a few weeks!).

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:48.863
It was through a series of failures and successes, rejections and realizations that I made it here.

00:04:49.363 --> 00:04:57.914
I think I learned something like a microcosm of this during my stint in entrepreneurship: you don’t just come up with a grand idea and implement it, making millions of dollars.

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:02.330
An idea is prototyped and polished before it becomes successful.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.426
You come up with a million bad ideas, improving every time.

00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:14.278
In the same way, I learned from all of my rejections and improved myself along the way until I was able to land what I think will be a sweet job.

00:05:14.778 --> 00:05:18.534
Yet I’m sure that this isn’t the end of my failing and learning process.

00:05:19.534 --> 00:05:21.691
So what’s the big take away?

00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:27.865
I think it’s that you can never be sure what counts as a true failure and what counts as true success.

00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:33.000
You can only try your best and keep adjusting along the way to try and get to where you want to be.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:42.370
Had I not been rejected by Google, I would have never gotten the chance to go to school at Michigan, meet many of the great friends I have now and end up with an awesome position at Microsoft.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:51.262
I can’t say the alternate universe version of me at Google wouldn’t have turned out better, but I can say that I am very happy with the way things turned out in this universe.

00:05:52.262 --> 00:05:58.015
I also think a large part of success has to do with skill, luck and perseverance.

00:05:58.515 --> 00:06:01.632
While I believe I’m skilled, I also know I’ve been very lucky.

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:06.607
While dumb luck helps a lot, I’ve also tried very hard to make my own luck.

00:06:07.107 --> 00:06:12.781
To me, this means creating opportunities, working harder to reach out to people and being proactive.

00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:19.754
You could wait for an opportunity to fall into your lap, but it’s always a good idea to try and speed up the process with a nudge.

00:06:20.754 --> 00:06:21.952
tl;dr ?

00:06:22.952 --> 00:06:28.626
If you find yourself overwhelmed by what you perceive as failures and rejections, stay positive.

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:34.880
Keep trying. Failures always come with a bit of information about how we can improve for the next time.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.215
And if you keep improving, it’s only a matter of time before you find success.
