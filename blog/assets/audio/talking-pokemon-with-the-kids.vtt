Talking Pokemon With The Kids

I had a chat with my 8 and 6 year-old nephew and niece, respectively, this evening over the phone.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.840
They’re really into Pokemon now.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.100
What weirds me out is that I was playing Pokemon before they were even born!

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.060
Apparently there’s a lot more Pokemon around now.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:32.680
I know the original 151 and some of the ones after that, and I have Pokemon Diamond (or is it Pearl), but seriously, there’s too many for me to remember.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.320
My niece and nephew both have their own favorites.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.500
One likes the scary legendary ones (I told him they look scary and he disagreed), Palkia, Dialga and some other ones.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.760
And the other likes Togetic, the evolution of Togepi.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.940
Yes, I remembered that!

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.180
Is it strange to have this much common ground with 8 and 6 year-olds?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.800
I guess it’s kind of cool, but sad at the same time.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.100
Pokemon is pretty freakin’ rad though, and I look forward to battling them at Christmas time when I see them.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
Bulbasaur, I choose you!
