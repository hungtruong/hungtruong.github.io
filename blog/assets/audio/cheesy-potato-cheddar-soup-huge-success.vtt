Cheesy Potato Cheddar Soup: Huge Success!

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:07.174
Published on April 07, 2010.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:14.327
I had some vegetable broth left over in the fridge because I made some green chile cheese enchiladas (which kind of turned out badly).

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:19.861
I was trying to think of a way to salvage the rest of the broth and I decided to try to make some soup.

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:25.416
Back in Highschool, my friend Kate used to bring potato cheese soup and she’d let me try some.

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:33.109
I really liked it and she even wrote the recipe in the back of my yearbook, but I hadn’t tried to make it until now.

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:34.967
It was way overdue.

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:38.205
I looked online for some recipes.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.862
There were quite a few variations.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:44.239
I read through a bunch and came up with a plan.

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:53.609
I went to Trader Joe’s and got a few Russet Potatoes (I think a lot of people say to use Yukon Gold), an onion, and a small block of sharp cheddar cheese.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.027
It was like $6 in all or something.

00:00:57.027 --> 00:01:02.062
I put the broth (there was about 2 or 3 cups left) into a big pot and started boiling it.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.797
I chopped up the potatoes into cubes and half the onion onto little pieces.

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:10.334
Then I threw them in the pot and let them boil for a while.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:14.909
The recipes say 20 minutes or so but I think I did less, maybe 15?

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.284
Then I separated the potato from the broth, and placed the pieces onto a plate.

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:22.142
I smashed them with a fork.

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:25.199
It was surprisingly easy to smash them.

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:30.174
I mixed them back in with the broth and let it simmer while I grated the cheddar cheese.

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:37.627
I added about .5 lbs (the package said .67 lbs of cheese and I used about 3/4 of it.

00:01:38.127 --> 00:01:40.124
Maybe I should’ve used less.

00:01:40.624 --> 00:01:41.743
Or maybe more?

00:01:42.743 --> 00:01:46.579
Anyway, the cheese melted well with the soup and it turned out really good.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.033
I think maybe there was a bit too much broth, so the soup was a bit soupier than i would’ve liked.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:57.968
But overall it was a huge success and I’ll now be eating leftover potato cheese soup for a few days.
