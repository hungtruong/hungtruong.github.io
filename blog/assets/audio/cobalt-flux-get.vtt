Cobalt Flux – GET!

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.460
Published on July 10, 2006.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.660
Well, it’s not quite gotten, but I won and paid for a Cobalt Flux on eBay, and it shipped today.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.000
Hopefully it’ll work and stuff.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.980
I’d been thinking of getting one for a while, since my DDR skills had advanced a bit (and lost some weight ) since this:

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.900
Right now I’m using a normal pad, but upgrading to the kick ass metal pad should help me get better scores.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.840
Like the Power Glove!

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.780
It cost a pretty penny ($280 shipped), but it also came with two games that I already have.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.080
So I can auction those off to bring the price down.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.660
Usually they go for $300 new plus like $50 for shipping.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.920
Plus you have to wait two weeks!

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.360
In all, I’m calculating that I saved about $100 (after I sell the extra games).

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.940
These DDR Pads are supposed to be pretty sturdy, so hopefully that means I don’t get a dud.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.280
I guess I’ll have a full review up once I play on the pads!
