Mega Man 9 Observations

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.140
I got Mega Man 9 for the Wii about a week ago.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.680
When I first got it I played it for a while and beat no one.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.620
Then I tried again today and so far I’ve beat three bosses.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.620
Mega Man 9 was made in the tradition of the old-school Mega Man games.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.000
So there’s instant death spikes.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.540
Question: Why didn’t Dr. Wily make “Spike Man?”

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.240
That’d pretty much make it impossible for Mega Man to beat him.
