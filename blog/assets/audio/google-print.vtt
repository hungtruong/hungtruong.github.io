I’m supposed to be doing research on a paper due tomorrow, but I was checking out this neat tool and I thought I would write about it, in order to procrastinate even more!

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.560
Google Print is, as you may have guessed, run by google, and lets you search inside the text of books.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.540
So if you searched “get thee to a nunnery,” you could find all sorts of references to Hamlet.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.840
You can read a few pages in the book too, but they don’t let you read the whole book, which would be awesome.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:41.060
Anyway, I guess it’s a good tool for finding books, and also a nice tool to use for writing papers if you’re doing it last minute and you need some references… Oh yeah, about that paper, I guess I should get started, eh?
