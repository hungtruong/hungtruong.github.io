I had a weird dream that won’t fit into Twitter, so I might as well write it down here since my blog hasn’t seen much love lately.

00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:19.322
This was the sort of dream where I’m watching a movie.

00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:26.615
The movie starred Cameron Diaz and Ellen Page as two roommates (or some people living in the same house) who have recently become zombified.

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:31.990
Apparently they’re fighting to survive in a dream/cyber world with other people in the same predicament.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.045
Now that I think of it, the plot resembles a modern Beetlejuice.

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:41.960
For some reason, Tina Fey was cast as their PR specialist.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.175
In one scene, Page and Diaz dump off Fey at the beach, along with one of their boyfriends.

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:54.228
Apparently they don’t want their significant others and family worrying about the fact that they’re zombies now, so they leave without a word.

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:58.963
I wasn’t sure how the family didn’t notice the smell (maybe they were being polite).

00:00:59.963 --> 00:01:03.639
If someone can get this green-lighted I’m sure I can fill in the rest of the details.
