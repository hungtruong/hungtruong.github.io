Fun Trolling Facebook Polls (For Science (Actually Lulz)!)

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:07.893
Published on January 26, 2011.

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:12.249
I saw a Facebook Poll late last night that a friend had voted on.

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.105
The question was something like “Which pair of shoes should I get?”

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:23.638
The poll had twitpic.com links as answers, so the idea was that people look at the pics and let the guy decide which pair of shoes was better.

00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:27.674
Apparently in Facebook Polls, you click on the answer to vote.

00:00:28.174 --> 00:00:32.889
And there’s no unvote (you can vote for another choice, but you can’t abstain after clicking).

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:40.102
So people ended up clicking on the twitpic link thinking they’d see the image, and ended up accidentally voting on the poll.

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:42.360
I fell for this, too.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.136
There were something like a couple thousand answers on that poll.

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:48.234
I believe it’s been removed now.

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:53.709
I figured I could do better with a more salient question, so I made one up myself.

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:56.287
“Which pair of glasses look better on me?”

00:00:56.787 --> 00:01:02.301
I made the question have two twitpic links, which you can view here and here if you actually copy and paste them in.

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:15.348
I figured people are naturally judgers, and something like helping someone choose glasses to wear is an easy task (plus you theoretically get to see pictures of faces, which people just love, consciously or subconsciously).

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:21.223
I started the poll late last night, which probably didn’t help, but a few friends took the bait.

00:01:21.723 --> 00:01:26.038
I hope they forgive me as I did this for science the lulz!

00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:34.450
When I woke up this morning, there were currently 51 votes, from people I know, friends of friends, and even people two degrees out of my social network!

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.624
I think it would be really interesting to see how this poll spreads through Facebook (assuming they don’t shut it down first).

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:49.215
I guess now that this post is published, any scientific value is gone (since you could be reading from anywhere and vote for my poll non-virally).

00:01:49.715 --> 00:02:02.103
The main point is that when you design systems very rigidly (in Facebook’s case, not letting people abstain from a poll, which believe it or not is a valid bit of information), interesting consequences pop up.

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:09.016
I’ll keep checking the status of the poll and see if it actually blows up, whimpers and dies or gets taken down quickly.

00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:12.014
Analysis Edit:

00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:20.286
I think another reason that this poll is so effective is that it makes it seem that the person who voted is the originator of the poll.

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:22.624
Check out the newsfeed formatting:

00:02:23.624 --> 00:02:30.017
The voter’s name is prominently displayed (though I blurred it) and the person who asked the question is nowhere to be seen.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:37.410
Edit #1 : The time is now about 12:40PM and the total number of voters has doubled to 99!

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.045
Edit #2 : It’s about 1:10PM and the number has doubled again to 201!

00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:49.639
Edit #3 : The time is around 1:24PM and there’s 304 answers.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:56.633
Edit #4 : Alright, it’s 1:35PM and there’s 406 votes.

00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:59.311
Edit #5 : Wow.

00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:03.007
It’s 1:41PM and there’s 502 votes.

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:07.523
Edit #5 : It’s 1:48 and there are 621 votes.

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:12.279
Edit #6 : I’m just going to simplify my updates now…
