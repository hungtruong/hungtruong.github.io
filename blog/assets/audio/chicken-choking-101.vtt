00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.140
Published on October 22, 2005.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.580
So there's this toy that teaches kids how to “choke the chicken.”

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.600
No, not that chicken!

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.860
It's a toy chicken, called Choke-a-Chicken that you literally choke!

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:26.020
Michael Beatty, spokesman for the Queensland state branch of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, fumed: “What's next?

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.880
Burn a cat?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.340
Shoot a dog?

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.340
Personally, I'd figure the next toys in this particular line would be: Spank a Monkey, or Groom a Wookie.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.160
Note: I did some extensive research on future toys over at Wikipedia.
