Wii Fit – Mini Review

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.180
Published on May 28, 2008.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.100
I pre-ordered Wii Fit from Amazon.com and got it a few days ago, on Friday, I believe.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.960
That was probably a good idea, since it seems there’s a Wii Fit shortage of sorts going around (in addition to the shortage of Wiis themselves).

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.780
I saw them going for pretty inflated prices on the Amazon Marketplace.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.840
I wonder if they’re actually selling for that much.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.120
Wii Fit comes with a neat balance board and a “game.”

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.780
I put “game” in quotations because it’s really debatable if it’s a game or not.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.840
The balance board is sort of a scale, balance sensor and exercise step all in one.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.620
Wii Fit (the game) is a collection of stuff that more or less fits in four categories:

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.060
Yoga Poses

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.580
Strength Training

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.940
Aerobic Stuff

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.020
Balance Games

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.180
The game starts out by giving you a really hippie-esque lecture about how balance is really important for you body.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.360
Like, the kind of balance where you don’t fall over and you put equal weight on your feet.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.740
I guess I never thought much about it, but I did the test and had some pretty interesting balance issues.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.120
My right foot seems to be pretty darn prominent.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.780
The board also tells me I’m obese!

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.880
NOOO! I lost a lot of weight playing DDR but since grad school started I’ve gained it back and then some.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.920
So I’m making a resolution of sorts to lose some weight.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.220
This is where Wii Fit actually does pretty well.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.540
First off I’ll say that the Yoga and Strength Training parts have a trainer that you can pick.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.560
Male or Female.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.420
The trainer does examples of the moves before you do them, then you see them do it as you’re doing it.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.480
Being a male, I chose the female trainer.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.540
I think this is probably what most people do.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.080
They pick the opposite sex because it’s more motivating.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.540
The female training avatar chick is kind of okay looking, but I think it would be cool if you could “customize” the experience.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.480
That’s all I’ll say about that.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.520
The yoga stuff probably won’t help burn much fat and stuff, but it is good for working on balance.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.580
I just finished unlocking all the yoga things (today is my 6th day on Wii Fit).

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.960
The last one is pretty crazy, but many of them are doable.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.220
I can do that one that the lady is doing on the box art (the tree) even though it looks kind of insane.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.040
At the very least the yoga stuff is good for mellowing out and breathing (which I learned to do pretty well being a brass instrument player, but probably suck quite a bit at now).

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.160
The strength training is probably the best part of the game to get fit.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.420
I should note that Wii Fit is probably the most painful game I’ve played since the original NES system (and its blister-inducing controller).

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.280
Like, I’m in a lot of pain for much of the exercises.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.140
Especially the push ups (which are really hard for me) and the plank, which is basically torture for fat people.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.880
It even sounds like a torture device!

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.140
In the 6 days I’ve been doing it, I think I actually am getting better.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.080
Imagine that, a game that gets easier each time you play it.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.320
The Aerobic stuff is kind of fun.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.060
There’s this weird hula hoop thing.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.320
It’s a little weird.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.100
Also, there this thing where you just run in place for a while.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.840
This wouldn’t be fun, except you get to see your Mii guy run around the island.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.780
It still isn’t really that fun, but it’s more fun than staring at the wall and running in place.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.080
I bet running outside would be even better though.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.640
The balance games are sort of fun, too.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.940
The skiing one is very fun, and there’s also a snowboard one (which you do sideways).

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.360
There’s also a zen thing where you sit on the board and stay as still as possible.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.020
Sounds like the luge or something!

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.700
Overall, Wii Fit is great because it provides so much feedback.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.800
When you do something right, the avatar tells you that you did a good job.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.300
If you screw up, they’re not too hard on you.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.920
But you get an actual number to show how well you did and you can keep track of that number.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.980
That’s definitely an incentive to keep trying and improve on stuff you’ve done in the past.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.400
When you weigh yourself, you get a history of your weight and you can actually see it getting closer (or farther) to the goal!

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.960
I think the biggest thing keeping people from exercising is probably motivation.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.700
The game gives you a good, personal motivation to keep trying to reach your goal.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.680
It does a good job of not sounding too preachy, but also telling it to you like it is.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.080
I’m not sure how long I’ll stick with it, but for now I would like to continue until I reach my goal of having a “normal” BMI.
