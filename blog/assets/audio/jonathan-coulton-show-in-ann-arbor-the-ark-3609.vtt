Jonathan Coulton Show in Ann Arbor (The Ark) 3/6/09

00:00:06.295 --> 00:00:08.692
Published on March 08, 2009.

00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:12.649
I have written about Jonathan Coulton in the past .

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:18.663
Last Friday, I got a chance to actually see him perform live, in front of my own eyes!

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:22.779
First, however, the opening band had to play for a while.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.473
The band in question was “Paul and Storm,” which I like to call, “Paul and the Storm.”

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:31.051
But apparently Storm is a human being.

00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:35.946
And it’s a guy, not the female X-Man (oxymoron?) who controls lightning.

00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:44.038
Their first song was about how they’re the opening band, and no one paid to hear them and we hope that they leave soon so Jonathan Coulton could get on stage.

00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:46.616
At least they have a good sense of humor about it!

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:49.673
Their songs were pretty interesting for the most part.

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:57.525
They had a way of choreographing things (Paul was always doing something with his hands) that kept it interesting and their harmonies were pretty sweet.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:05.697
They also gave out random prizes like an uncomfortably small Batman mask and monkey keychain that lit up and made monkey noises.

00:01:06.697 --> 00:01:11.332
Before the show, Jonathan Coulton asked for requests from the audience via The Twitter.

00:01:11.832 --> 00:01:13.669
I like calling it “The Twitter.”

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:15.448
Don’t judge me for that.

00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:20.743
Anyway, I requested “ Octopus ” and the song he plays on the John Hodgman audio book .

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:25.478
I figured he probably wouldn’t play the Hodgman one since Hodgman wasn’t there to read his part.

00:01:25.978 --> 00:01:27.816
But I really like that song.

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:33.111
Especially the part where he whispers “Dungeons & Dragons, monsters and magical spells!”

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:40.004
I didn’t request the more popular ones because I figured he has to play First of May and Skullcrusher Mountain and Code Monkey .

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.641
Oh, I should mention I went with my friend Kathleen.

00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:47.177
We both noticed that the entire Ark was a nerd herd.

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:49.915
Like seriously, all kinds of nerds were there.

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:52.572
And it was okay to show your nerdiness!

00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:57.308
I think this is probably how it feels to go to a comic book or Star Trek convention.

00:01:57.808 --> 00:02:04.680
There were lots of references to nerd stuff like Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan ( Botany Bay ?) and Hitchhiker’s Guide.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.756
Also, it was pretty apparent that the crowd really knew Coulton’s work.

00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:20.405
Because at the funny parts, no one really laughed (Like during First of May, for example) except maybe as a polite gesture, and during Skullcrusher Mountain, JoCo let the audience sing the chorus once.

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:22.663
And it was loud and perfect.

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:26.040
This sort of scared both me and my compatriot.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.015
Also, everyone knew what to do for the audience participation in “Re: Your Brains.”

00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:34.152
JoCo pretty much owned this crowd.

00:02:34.652 --> 00:02:49.197
And the crowd was generous to JoCo, showering him with gifts like a Starbucks gift card, a half pony/monkey monster (to please him), a toy monkey with banana candy inside of its transparent stomach and for some reason they had him sign a cake (I dunno if he got any of it).

00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:52.275
Overall the show was good times.

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:56.531
Coulton sings in pretty much the same voice as he does in his recordings.

00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:00.787
So I can safely say that he’s not being overproduced or something like a boy band.

00:03:01.287 --> 00:03:05.362
Though it should be noted that he cannot sing harmonies with himself live.

00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:07.860
That’s what Paul and the Storm are for.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.392
At one point in the concert I realized just how weird his songs were, and that the audience was just as weird.

00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:20.687
The moment was when stated, matter-of-factly: “ This is a song about a giant squid who hates himself .”

00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:22.705
And then he played the song!

00:03:23.705 --> 00:03:30.258
Coulton did the whole “this is the last song” and then came back as an encore, and noted how cheesy it is to do that.

00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:32.436
But it’s sort of necessary.

00:03:32.936 --> 00:03:38.450
Unfortunately he only played two songs for his encore and didn’t come back for an encore #2.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.188
But you gotta leave the audience wanting more.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:44.245
I wanted to hear “ Tom Cruise Crazy .”

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:46.982
I guess it’ll have to wait for next time.
