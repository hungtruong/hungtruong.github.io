2010: A Hung Truong Year In Review

00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:06.694
Published on December 31, 2010.

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:12.968
Looking back at 2010, this year has been one of change and growth for me.

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:16.745
I’d like to take a post and look back at what I did this year.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.462
January and February were kinda uneventful.

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:24.318
I was pretty nose down trying to become a good PM at Microsoft.

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:30.412
Oh, and I was busy making troll posts about how the iPad was gonna suck and I wrote a lot of book and music reviews.

00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:38.284
In March , I attended SXSW and moderated a panel that I had submitted the year before on Student Startups.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:43.499
I met many of my friends who I hadn’t seen in a while and met a lot of cool new people .

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:52.470
It was from that experience that I decided I needed to stop doing what I was currently doing and change course so that I could do what I was “meant” to do.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.445
Also in March, I was rejected from the one PhD program I had applied to.

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.662
In hindsight, this was probably a good thing.

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.559
I’m used to rejection anyway!

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.752
In April I officially resigned from Microsoft as a PM after only about 7 months (and 5 managers!) on the job.

00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:14.569
I knew this was a serious decision.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.386
In hindsight, I’m glad I did it.

00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:24.839
Quitting let me focus on other cool stuff that I was meaning to get into, like iPhone (now iOS) development.

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:31.093
In the same month I finally released an app to the iTunes App Store , something I had wanted to do for years.

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:40.644
In May, I moved back to Ann Arbor to be near to my GF, which required me to pack all my crap into my Corolla and drive the whole way.

00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:44.899
I also flew to New Mexico for a wedding and got to hang out with my family.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.155
This probably explains why I have no blog posts for May 2010.

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:56.388
In June I mostly basked in the glory of my funemployment and took it easy (read: I marathoned Lost).

00:01:56.888 --> 00:02:02.882
I also tinkered with my existing iPhone app and enhanced it a bit, building up my Obj-C chops.

00:02:03.382 --> 00:02:08.656
I interviewed for some jobs here and there to test out the waters, but none ended up being fruitful.

00:02:09.156 --> 00:02:14.830
The incompetence of HR departments never ceases to amaze me, but I suppose that’s a topic for a different post.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.385
In July I looked for some more opportunities to work with other companies.

00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:29.516
I didn’t end up teaming up with anyone, but a conversation I had during an “interview” led me to start development on Checkmate, my second app for the iPhone.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:33.292
I spent a fair amount of July developing and testing Checkmate.

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:38.427
I also took a cool part-time gig with the coolest boss in history .

00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:43.742
August saw the release of Checkmate , which was featured in a story on Mashable !

00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:45.760
Thanks, Pete Cashmore!

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.373
While Checkmate wasn’t (and it still isn’t) the perfect app, I learned a ton from developing it and gained a lot of confidence as well.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:59.626
I also discovered the NPR news story of that time I went on a chocolate factory tour in Seattle !

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:06.380
My September was mostly spent improving Checkmate and learning about how to handle a paid app in the App Store.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.997
Doing a paid app is a quite a bit different than a free one.

00:03:10.497 --> 00:03:15.052
I also spent some time looking for an old printing press and finally scored one on craigslist !

00:03:16.052 --> 00:03:21.086
In October , I started working on another app that eventually became ♥s Threadless.

00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:29.498
This was the biggest undertaking I’ve done so far on iOS, and it also required me to do more complicated work in App Engine than I had done before.

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:37.829
I also spent October tracking down supplies for my Letterpress machine, and ended up doing my first prints ever: Giraffe Coasters !

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:47.220
I split my November into days where I’d work on getting better at printmaking (and coming up with stuff like these letterpress business cards ) and days where I’d work on the Threadless app.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.556
I finally ended up releasing the Threadless app at the end of November.

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:54.453
The reception of the app has been great!

00:03:54.953 --> 00:04:00.307
So far the app has 6 perfect reviews and one 4-star review.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.045
That makes me incredibly happy.

00:04:04.045 --> 00:04:07.081
This brings us to the current month, December .

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:13.495
I started another app engine project that’s not quite ready for public beta yet (though I feel it will be really soon).

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:19.269
Because of the app, Threadless was super cool and invited me to their Chicago headquarters.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.804
I finally realized one of my lifelong dreams of becoming a Threadless t-shirt model !

00:04:25.304 --> 00:04:30.178
I’ve also been hanging out in Albuquerque and spoiling my nephew rotten for a few weeks.

00:04:31.178 --> 00:04:33.735
And that is my 2010 year in review.

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:39.669
One surprising thing is that many times during 2010, I was really down on myself.

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.446
But looking back, I actually accomplished some neat stuff!

00:04:43.946 --> 00:04:48.980
I think it boils down to the fact that there’s still a lot of uncertainty in my life, and that’s hard to manage.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.037
But I think I’m getting better at managing it every day.

00:04:52.537 --> 00:04:57.652
In retrospect, 2010 was a great year, maybe even the best (so far).

00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:02.248
Looking at 2011, I see a lot of opportunity.

00:05:02.748 --> 00:05:06.583
I’m going to continue to remind myself that minor setbacks are just that.

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:10.839
I’ll push through them and accomplish even more than I did in 2010!

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.136
My role model for 2011 is this guy:

00:05:15.136 --> 00:05:18.173
Hopefully I’ll have some good stuff to report in a year or so!
