There IS Free Lunch!

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.660
Published on February 05, 2008.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.340
So one of the things that has surprised me about grad school in comparison to my undergrad is the large amounts of free food being offered every day.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.440
I think it has to do with the fact that UNM was a pretty small school and Michigan is a behemoth of schools.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:29.100
I’m always getting emails just from my own school within the U (School of Information) about events with pizza and pop (soda!) included.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.300
There’s almost always free food for me to eat on Thursdays.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.320
Fridays are good too.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.140
I actually end up spending quite a bit of time planning where my next free meal will come from.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.880
For example, there’s a Teach For America thing going on tomorrow at the Union that will have food from Zingerman’s.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.500
Thursday there’s a company info session and Friday there’s a panel/session, both of which will offer free food.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.960
That’s already like, $20 in food savings for me (if I had eaten out at some place near campus, which would be the most likely scenario)!

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.960
At one point I pondered whether I could run an experment: to eat only free food for the entire semester!

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.260
I decided that I would probably end up starving or getting really weak while begging for food.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.940
I found a site called “ Hungry Hungry Coeds ” that lists free food events at some select campuses.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.920
Luckily it seems that the creators of the site went to Michigan, or at least the main contributor goes here.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.100
I’ll be checking it routinely to see if I can maximize my free food intake.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.440
Maybe I should also keep a log of all the free food I eat per week.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.860
Could end up being another blog…
