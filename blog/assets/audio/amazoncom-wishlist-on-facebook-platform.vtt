Amazon.com Wishlist on Facebook Platform

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.500
Published on June 12, 2007.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.420
So I had the idea like two days ago to do an Amazon.com wishlist app for the newly opened Facebook Platform.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.080
I hadn’t done anything with either the platform or Amazon.com’s API, so I had a bit of looking up to do.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.800
Still, I finished in about two days.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.900
Well, “finished” sort of, since I’ll be out of town for a week and I won’t be able to work on the thing until after that.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.280
The rest of the functionality shouldn’t be too hard though.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.900
It’s a pretty simple app.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.100
Facebook’s API is pretty cool, but also kind of frustrating.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.560
There’s still a lot of limitations, but I guess I can understand those since it’s basically to keep Facebook from turning into Myspace.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.060
The API is somewhat well documented, but there’s a lot of bugs.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.360
Also, the developer forums seem to have about 80% script kids, and 20% actual developers.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.780
I think the saying “RTFM” should be changed to “RTFAPID” (Read The Friendly API Docs).

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.620
So yeah, if you have a Facebook account and an Amazon.com wishlist, try the app out and tell me what you think.
