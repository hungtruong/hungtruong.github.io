Now That’s What I Call REAL ULTIMATE HR!

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.180
Published on March 26, 2008.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.260
I met a recruiter from this company called imo.im last week at the Mpowered career fair on North Campus.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.200
Basically, the event was a career fair for startup companies.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.740
For some reason, some really big companies were there as well.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.080
I think I saw NEC…

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.360
Anyway, imo.im is some sort of web-based IM client, kind of like Meebo.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.100
I even asked the recruiter something like, “I’m sure you get asked this a lot, but this company is like Meebo, right?”

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.480
Anyway, it seems the claim to fame for imo.im is that they’re financed almost exclusively by one of the first 10 employees of Google.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.700
This post isn’t really about their company though.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.640
It’s about their HR!

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.800
There were a bunch of t-shirts on the table.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.020
I, being a t-shirt connoisseur, especially of the company shwag type, asked if I could have one.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.680
“But they’re reserved for interviewees,” the HR person Marissa Huang told me.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.060
She also said she could mail me one when she gets back to their headquarters, since they have a lot.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.520
I gave her my contact info and figured I’d never get the shirt.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.980
Here’s a story!

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.020
When I went to interview at Google, they said I’d get some kind of awesome bag with Google related goodies in it.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.840
Like shirts and lava lamps and whatnot.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.860
Maybe not lava lamps.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.960
Anyway, it was supposed to be in my hotel room but I never got it.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.580
After the HR person at Google asked for my address for them to mail it, I felt that I’d get the stuff for sure, but I never did.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.360
It was like adding insult to the injury of not hiring me.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:54.740
By the way, I’ve fully recovered and hold no ill will towards the big G. Just throwing out this story to prove a point: why would imo.im go to the trouble of sending me a shirt when I didn’t even interview with them?

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.620
But they did.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.080
And it came today.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.780
Which is why I award imo.im the official “Hung Truong Company Shwag Award Seal of Approval!”

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.880
I don’t know if something can be both an award AND a seal of approval at the same time, but whatever.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.060
There was also a nice hand-written note in the package, which is unheard of as far as corporate HR goes.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920
But imo.im is a startup, so I guess that makes them different.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.400
Anyway, thanks, imo.im , for the t-shirt.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:36.220
As a bonus, I’m even not adding a rel=”nofollow” to my links to you! Rock on!
