Hung Withdrew TWENTY TEN. Hung Sent Out K2. It’s Super Effective!

00:00:08.813 --> 00:00:10.891
I switched my blog theme again.

00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:16.745
Twenty Ten is the official default theme of WordPress 3.0, but that doesn’t make it good.

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:19.083
Too much wasted space on top.

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:24.537
On a normal monitor, you practically have to go below the fold to get to any content!

00:00:25.537 --> 00:00:27.934
I switched back to good ol’ K2 .

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:34.428
It’s good to have you back, buddy (even though by default you show post featured images in a really, really stupid way)!
