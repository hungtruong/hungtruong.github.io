The Dark Knight: In IMAX!

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.900
Published on July 18, 2008.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.860
I went to see The Dark Knight in IMAX last night.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.320
It was pretty good.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.300
I mean, as far as movies go it was probably one of the best I’ve seen in years.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.480
But there was so much hype leading up to it that the movie was kind of wasted.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.540
My co-workers were really psyched about the movie.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.920
So listening to them continuously talk up the movie had its effect on me, I guess.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.500
If I had come in with no expectations, the movie would’ve been incredible.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.400
It still was, and it met the hype, but sometimes I feel the best way to go into a movie is with no expectations at all.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.720
When I went to see Wall-e a few weeks ago (or maybe it was just last week), I had no idea what the movie was about.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.540
Okay, so I knew it had a robot in it.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.240
And that was about it.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.500
I ended up enjoying it a lot!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.160
I think we, as viewers, should just let the damn story tell itself.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.180
No spoilers, no trailers, maybe just a title.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.460
Knowing as little as possible about a movie going into it probably gives the best chance for me to enjoy it.
