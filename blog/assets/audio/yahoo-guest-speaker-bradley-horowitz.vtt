Yahoo Guest Speaker: Bradley Horowitz

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on November 27, 2007.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.940
Today there was a guest talk by one Bradley Horowitz over at the Computer Science building on North Campus.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:23.480
The title, “Innovation and Evolution -How Search, Social Media, and New Ideas can Shape the Next Web,” intrigued me enough to compel me to check it out.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.200
Much of the talk was devoted to Flickr, and how lots of useful information can be extracted from the inherent metadata of tags, traffic, and geodata of the photos on the site.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:47.300
For example, Flickr can make a list of “interesting” photos, figure out correlations between tags and photos (it can semi-distinguish between photos of love between two people, love as a symbol, and love as puppies), and figure out the location of Route 66.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.500
I was vehemently unimpressed by an earlier Yahoo talk this year, but today’s was neat.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.120
Probably because the speaker knew what he was talking about.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.700
Fun fact: the speaker is VP of the Advanced Development Division at Yahoo.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.240
Or ADD. Apparently the name was not an accident.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.780
He mentioned quite a few interesting things like their “Brick House” incubator, and a few products of it like Pipes and something called Kickstart .

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.860
Kickstart seems to be something of a mix between Facebook and LinkedIn.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.960
Or something. I had to sign up for a Yahoo account to use it.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.580
Minor tangent: I hate Yahoo because I can’t get the login info for all of my old usernames (because I don’t use them anymore) so whenever I want to use something Yahoo, I have to sign up for a new account.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.480
And since Yahoo has so many users, no sane usernames exist anymore.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.780
It took me like 30 minutes to come up with escargoal (like a cross between escargot and goal)!

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:53.100
I’m not sure how many social networks Yahoo wants… They’ve got that Yahoo 360, Mash, Kickstart… I guess an alternate strategy to buying Facebook could be diluting the social network market…

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.580
But anyway, the talk was pretty cool, though somewhat high level for a crowd of CS kids (and SI kids, I suppose).

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.080
Where was the talk of computational complexity and algorithms in Flickr!?

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.900
The talk has at least rewarmed my interest in looking for a Summer internship at Yahoo, possibly in the ADD…
