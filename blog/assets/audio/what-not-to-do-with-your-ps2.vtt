What Not to Do With Your PS2

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.300
Published on July 05, 2006.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.660
Back when my anime blog was in its infancy, I was writing video game related posts, too.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.320
Today I was cleaning up my previous entries, and came across one about the warning pictures from the PS2 manual.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.140
I figured it would be more at home here, so without further ado, I present “What Not to Do With Your PS2”:

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.620
Do not unplug the Playstation at any time.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.440
It will become aware of your treachery, flip out, and kill people.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.040
Making Japanese tea near your PS2 will cause it to return to the ether stream from whence it came.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.080
Do not place your PS2 near an air conditioner.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.780
ACs hate other appliances.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.000
Didn’t you watch The Brave Little Toaster?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.040
Do not plug your Playstation 2 in during a thunderstorm.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.060
You will instantly die.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.020
Do not stab your power cord with a broadsword.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.460
The Xbox360 will totally fubar your discs.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.560
Get a PS2 instead.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.120
Your Playstation 2 is already black.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.700
It does not need to get a tan.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.300
Do not insert Staryu, Luvdisc, or any other Pokemon into your Playstation 2.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.040
This isn’t a freakin’ Gamecube!

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.120
Do not install a flip top loader.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.500
Sony DRM will take your hand if you do.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.620
Do not let your little brother play with the Playstation 2.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.400
He’s an idiot.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.680
Pwnd!

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.760
Do not go backpacking to the Swedish Alps while leaving your Playstation 2 unplugged in your transparent house.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.100
This is just common sense.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.300
The following are from the US version of the PS2 manual:

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.460
Do convice your mom that Playstation 2 is more important than groceries.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.880
Make her buy one in the rain.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.020
That’ll teach her for making daddy leave us!

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.300
Do not let your mom try to play Rez with the trance vibrator in the bathtub with the shower on.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.240
Hey, your mom is hot!

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.880
Damn it! Tell your mom to clean somewhere else!

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.220
And make me a sandwich!
