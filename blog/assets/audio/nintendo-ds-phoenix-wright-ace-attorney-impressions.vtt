Nintendo DS – Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Impressions

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.180
Published on December 28, 2006.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.220
I recently went on a video game buying splurge, since I finished school and I figured I’d have more time to devote to video games.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.240
One of the games I bought was “ Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney .”

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.980
It was released in limited quantities a while back, gained a cult following, and was subsequently re-released.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.060
Phoenix Wright is a lawyer game.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.040
Yeah, that’s right, you play as a defense lawyer.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.860
Your job is to prove that your client is innocent, even when the evidence is strongly against him.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160
While this might not sound like the coolest idea for a game, it actually works pretty well.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.820
You listen to witnesses give their testimony and try to find inconsistencies.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.440
If they lie, you press them until they admit to it, or present evidence that proves that they’re lying.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.900
It’s pretty fun.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.540
Right now I’m on the third case, where I need to prove that an action star is innocent of murder.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.880
The characters are all fairly amusing, and the story isn’t bad either.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.460
Apparently, the Phoenix Wright 2 preorder is underway.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.400
You can get a finger stylus to point at liars if you preorder.
