This Week in Hung Truong: 5-25-08

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on May 25, 2008.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.100
So quite a lot has happened this week.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.200
So much, in fact, that I haven’t really had much time to do things like write about what I’ve been doing in my blog.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.500
So here’s a bulleted list of things I did this past week.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.880
Perhaps I’ll write posts about them too, if I find some time:

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.920
Bought a PS3 and Grand Theft Auto 4 .

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.520
Started a new company with some friends (part of my internship).

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.140
This should probably require a whole new post or something.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.980
Watched Snakes on a Plane .

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.180
Got Wii Fit .

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.740
Started moving some of my websites to a new server.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.520
Currently trying to figure out how to run rails using Mongrel.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.080
Currently fighting off an ant infestation.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.720
Etc.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.880
So, yeah. If I have time maybe I’ll write some more about these things.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.940
Anyone have a preference to what they want to read about?

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.340
EDIT: I also just realized that I also:

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.300
Am growing a beard.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.060
Did some taste experiments on a Faygo flavor known as “Rock & Rye.”

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.500
There’s probably even more.
