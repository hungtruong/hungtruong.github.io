Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories Pre-order at NIS America!

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.700
Published on July 25, 2006.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.780
Okay, so here’s the deal: I’m a total Nippon Ichi fanboy.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840
I loved Disgaea , Phantom Brave was cool, Makai Kingdom was better.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:28.620
I even have the rare (well, not anymore) Rhapsody: A Musical Interlude for PS, though I haven’t played through it yet (it seems kinda primitive in comparison).

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.440
If you’re still not convinced, read this post .

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.600
Disgaea 2 is coming out in America on August 29, so I gotta be ready!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.100
NIS America actually has a somewhat sweet pre-order package available.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:51.140
For $75, you can get the Disgaea 2 game (duh), A strategy guide, a volume of the Disgaea manga, an art book, and the official soundtrack.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.680
Yeah! There’s some other digital download things too, like the game manual and some mouse cursor or something.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.300
There’s also a different package for $65 that only doesn’t include the manga. Lame.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:13.140
The way I calculate it, the video game is worth $50 (or more; I’ve been waiting forever for it!), the manga will probably be worth $10, and the strategy guide would be $20.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.600
Add another $10 for the soundtrack and $75 isn’t looking so bad.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.900
Plus I get to support my favorite video game company ever, Nippon Ichi!

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.660
Okay, I’m going to stop right now, because I sort of sound like a commercial.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.120
But that’s what fanboys are for! N1 forever!
