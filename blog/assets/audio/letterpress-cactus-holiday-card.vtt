Yesterday I printed out some fun cactus holiday cards and today I put them on Etsy .

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.183
This is my first time making cards using a decent quality paper (Arturo Stationery from Hollander’s ).

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:23.877
I got the cactus print block from Ebay and hand-set the type that says “Happy Holidays!”

00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:27.035
I’m pretty happy with the result.

00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:33.608
I may end up buying the supplies to use photopolymer plates (a metal base) because this is way, way fun!
