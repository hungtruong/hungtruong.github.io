Start Spreading The News… I’m Moving to NYC For The Summer!

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:06.454
Published on June 02, 2011.

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:15.446
So I’ve been relatively quiet on this piece of news for a while, but since I’m moving to New York in like, two days, I figure I should post something about it.

00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:27.475
A few months ago, I joined up with Bebarang , a startup that’s graduated from the TechArb program at the University of Michigan and has been accepted into NYC SeedStart for the Summer of 2011.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:32.609
The simple pitch is that we’re trying to solve the problem of babies growing out of their clothes all the time.

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:35.587
We’re still figuring out the details.

00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:41.301
I am super excited (and lucky) to be part of another entrepreneurial incubator program.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:48.194
I gained a whole lot from the awesomeness of RPM10 , and I hope the same will be true for NYC SeedStart.

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:53.889
My partner, Allen, is super sharp and I think we’ll end up getting a lot of stuff done between the two of us.

00:00:54.889 --> 00:01:05.198
Regardless if we exit at $100 billion (or settle for a $50 billion exit), I’m looking forward to living in a new city, getting to know the tech scene and building up a company once again.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:09.214
Stay tuned for updates about my summer in NY!
