Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories First Impressions

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.380
Published on September 01, 2006.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.140
So I got my Disgaea 2 preorder in the mail a few days ago, and I’ve already played about 8+ hours.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.280
Yeah, my semester is really going to hell.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.300
Anyway, I thought I’d write about my impressions of the sequel to probably the best game ever.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.860
So far, this game is pretty much like the original Disgaea.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.080
That’s a good thing.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.340
The story is different, but almost everything is the same as the original.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.320
For example, the grid based movement system is back.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540
The lifting and throwing system is still there.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.760
The geo panel stuff is also still present.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.780
Basically the only thing that has changed are the characters and the setting.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.780
As for the story, it’s ok.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.440
It centers around a human, Adell, trying to summon a powerful demon overlord into changing his family back into humans.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.420
They were turned into demons a few years back.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.320
He ends up summoning the overlord’s hot daughter, Rozalin instead.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.340
The story can get a little heavy sometimes with Adell being emo, but for the most part it’s pretty funny.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.020
The only new feature I’ve noticed so far is the felony system.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.520
I didn’t really look into it that much, but commiting crimes basically means that your demon has certain advantages in the game.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.100
The crimes I commited so far are “Geo Vandalism” and “High RES.”

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.360
They seem kind of random.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.200
I might write about Disgaea 2 some more once I’ve gotten more into it.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.020
For now, I think I better regulate my playing, or this might not turn out to be my last semester of college after all!
