I’m Back from the Mountain West Basketball Tournament!

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.100
Published on March 10, 2006.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.780
Due to unforeseen circumstances (our teams losing), the band has returned a bit earlier than expected.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.360
Overall, the basketball tournament was fairly disappointing, if only because of our high expectations for our teams.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.100
Everyone expected the women to advance through at least the first round, so when they didn’t, it was really a shock!

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.440
On the upside, I found myself in one of the basketball action pictures!

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.580
Sure, I’m small and blurry, but I won’t complain!

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.460
The picture also features #5 Abbie Letz, my favorite basketball player ever!

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.920
Cool, huh? And before you point out that I wasn’t paying attention to the game, I totally was!

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.140
I think someone must have been talking to me or something.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.820
Anyhow, I still have confidence that our women’s team will be making an NCAA appearance (knock on wood), so this is by no means the end of the season.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.640
Let’s go Letz, and Go Lobos!
