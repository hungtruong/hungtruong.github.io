Wait, did I really forget to mention that my SXSW Panel submission for Student Startups was accepted?

00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:20.181
I really have been busy at work.

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:29.013
I just got news from Hugh (the guy who invented SXSW) that my panel is going to happen on Monday, March 15th 2010!

The panelists will be Ellen Chisa from Alight Learning, Ben Congleton from Olark and Rishi Narayan from Underground Printing.
