Today Nintendo announced a new Zelda title for the DS!

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.960
It’s called The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, and it looks friggin’ sweet!

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.200
I’m really glad they decided to make an actual new game instead of doing a port from The Ocarina of Time or something.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.580
The game looks to be in the same style of Windwaker.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
So far, the video shows the gameplay utilizing the Nintendo DS’ stylus quite a bit.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.180
You can draw on the map, use the stylus to solve puzzles and chart a course for your boat.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.540
I think it’s definitely a good time to be a Nintendo fan.
