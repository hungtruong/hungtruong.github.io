Sorry Arturo, It’s Over.

I deleted all the Arturo Sandoval MP3s I had on my hard drive.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.160
Why? Because I realized that Arturo Sandoval is kind of a hack.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.060
Sure, he can play some pretty high notes, but everything else he does is pretty crappy.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.080
Like having an album cover for “I Remember Clifford” with Clifford Brown and himself in the same pose.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.460
Sorry, Arturo, you’re not Clifford Brown, and it’s over.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.480
Also, your version of the titular song is wayyyyy too fancy.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.100
In a bad way.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.100
I’ll still listen to Maynard Ferguson, though, since he’s pretty fun, and he never compared himself to dead Jazz legends.
