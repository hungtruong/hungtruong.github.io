They Might Be Giants Concert @ The Mighican Theater!

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.700
Published on November 14, 2007.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.660
I just got back from the TMBG Concert.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.380
So the opening band was called Oppenheimer .

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.080
They’re two guys from Northern Ireland, apparently.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.700
The band seems like a suitable opener for TMBG, since they consist of two guys.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.800
The bald guy plays drums and sings, and the slightly chubby one plays guitar and sings with the robot-inducing keyboard thing. Voicebox?

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.240
I’m glad I got The Else before this concert, because it sucks not knowing the songs when a band plays it live.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.820
Something about having to process the song instead of sort of knowing what’s going to happen.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160
With Oppenheimer, I didn’t know any songs, so it was sorta hard to get it.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.220
Plus their songs were all very electronicy.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.800
Like with sustained chords and such.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.060
They were pretty cool though.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.080
The chubby guitarist also seemed really into it, sort of like a guitar-playing Star Wars Kid !

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.320
TMBG started off with one of their new songs, The Cap’m and ended up playing quite a few of The Else songs.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.860
After the first song, Flans told everyone to go stand in the front, so I ran into the aisle to the 10th row or so.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.000
Maybe closer. That was cool, since my seat was right behind an Amazonian lady.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.820
Nothing against her, but I couldn’t see Oppenheimer because of her massive head (and its height).

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.380
So I got to rock out in the aisle the whole show.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.760
It was cool!

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.980
They played a mix of songs mostly from their newer albums (The Else, The Spine, and Mink Car) and a few of the “classics.”

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.440
They didn’t play Ana Ng, Don’t Let’s Start or She’s an Angel, which was kind of dissapointing.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.020
But they did play The Famous Polka!

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.520
Without the words… Ooh, they played Why Does The Sun Shine?

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.020
and Meet James Ensor though, which almost makes up for it.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.880
And Doctor Worm.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.820
And New York City.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.520
It was a good show.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.200
If I could have done the playlist, I’d have taken off Cyclops Rock (though it actually sounds good live) and XTC Vs Adam Ant.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.300
They also played this weird song where they listed countries in alphabetical order that I’ve never heard before.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.040
It must be off the kid’s album.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.060
With those songs removed, I would’ve added those previously mentioned unplayed songs, and maybe some of Linnell’s state songs (Montana!).

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.100
Also strange was the absence of my favorite song of the new album, Upside Down Frown… It made me turn my smile upside down.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.040
Temporarily. They did play the Mesopotamian one though.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.200
Singing-wise, they were very good.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.860
I actually think they sound better live.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.280
There’s a lot more energy in their live show that doesn’t get transmitted in the CDs.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.580
Linnell really belts it out, as well as Flansburgh (especially during Istanbul (not Constantinpole)’s interlude part.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.600
Some songs that I’ve disliked in the past sounded better live.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.680
They also had some weird skits, like they made a phone call with some dead person.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.380
Tonight (I dunno if it changes) was Jerry Orbach , who I didn’t even realize was dead!

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.440
Apparently the rest of the audience didn’t know who he was by his name (along with me), since They sorta had to explain the gag.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.780
Then Jerry (Flans) and Linnell (Linnell) had a duet.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.340
TMBG left somewhat suddenly after playing their Mesopotamian song.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.800
Then the audience started clapping and the house lights didn’t go on, so we kept clapping and yelling until the band came back to play more songs.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.020
Then they played a couple more songs and left again.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.840
Then we got them to come back again.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.060
I know it’s part of the showmanship thing, but playing a part in this rehearsed set of events kind of makes me feel used.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.840
Psychologically though, I guess it was better than if they just said “so long!” after their real last song.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.280
Having played quite a few gigs in a band myself, I can say that people sort of expect you to play another song after you say you’re done.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.220
So it’s always kind of good to cover your ass by saying you’re done when you’re not.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.760
Because fans get pretty pissed when you quit without doing an encore.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Except if you fucked up that night, which also happened a lot in the band I was in.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.880
But I digress…

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.480
Overall, it was a cool show, and I think I got my money’s worth.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.780
It’s sort of strange seeing these people that you’ve heard for years actually making music on the fly.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.920
Like “whoa, this music is made by real people!”

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.020
I’d have stayed and tried to get something autographed, but I heard that they weren’t going to meet fans after the show.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.360
I went to the merch place and they had CDs that were pre-autographed.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.620
Sort of lame, really.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.240
It’s not like the CDs were priced any higher than normal, but at least show up to say hi to the fans!

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.300
Okay, I didn’t stick around, so maybe they did, but they definitely gave the impression of not caring with the pre-autographed stuff.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.180
If I ever get a chance to see them again, I’ll probably take it.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.280
I had a good time.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.620
If this was an eBay transaction, it’s probably go something like: “SUPER FAST SHIPPING GREAT COMM WOULD BUY FROM AGAIN AAAA+++++++!!!!!!”

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.080
But don’t they all?
