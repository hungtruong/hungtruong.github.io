Letterpress Business Cards!

00:00:03.338 --> 00:00:05.655
Published on November 12, 2010.

00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:09.932
I’ve been busy printing random stuff on my letterpress.

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:13.628
I got some color ink and an old wood ‘H’ block.

00:00:14.128 --> 00:00:18.683
Oh, and I also ordered some blank business cards, so I decided to print myself a few.

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:22.080
I printed each card twice.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:31.131
First I printed the green ‘H’ and after that I set the type for the name, phone, email etc. I ran into a few issues with the width of the card at first.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:36.106
Since I wanted to have a vertical card, I only had so much space for the info.

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:42.680
The type that I have doesn’t have the ‘@’ symbol, and “Hung AT Hung-Truong.com” wouldn’t fit on one line.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.853
So I just ended up putting it on two lines, which is nice because then the other line is just my website address.

00:00:49.853 --> 00:00:52.411
I like the grainy look of the block ‘H’.

00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:58.824
Each one looks a little different, and at one point I mixed in some more blue to make it a darker green.

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:02.840
It’s nice that the card itself is a slightly unique print.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.676
If I could redo this card, I’d probably try to pick a smaller font for the info.

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:12.091
And I’d also choose different sizes for my name versus the other stuff.

00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:16.347
I’m sort of limited in the type that I currently own (4 trays).

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:22.281
If I end up making more cards, I might just buy a base so that I can make my own photopolymer plates.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:27.176
That’d be cool because I could also make my own designs for cards/coasters etc too.
