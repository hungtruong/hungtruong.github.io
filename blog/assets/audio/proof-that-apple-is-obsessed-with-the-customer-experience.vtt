Proof That Apple is Obsessed With The Customer Experience

00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:07.893

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:16.405
I was at the mall today just wasting my time (and looking at options for getting my eye prescription checked), and I stopped by the Apple Store.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:22.019
As I approached, I noticed an army of people in blue shirts, just waiting to help anyone who walked in.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.716
I soon realized that they were just cardboard cutouts.

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:34.627
Neat. I walked in and looked around at the unibody Macbooks (the white ones that are now more curvy) and checked the battery life on them.

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:43.598
They apparently get something like 5 hours (when I unplugged them and the computer actually calculated) versus my MacBook Pro that gets like 2 if I’m lucky.

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:46.756
Then I walked around and noticed something:

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.872
Apple printed the backs of the cardboard cutouts!

00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:54.009
They’re in the same poses in the back as they are on the front!

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:58.265
If the backs had been blank, I probably wouldn’t have even noticed.

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:04.359
But Apple pays so much attention to detail that they decided that peoples asses must be printed.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:09.994
It is likely due to this level of detail that Apple is succeeding where other companies fail hard.

00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:16.327
I don’t care what anyone says about Apple, they care more about the user/customer experience than probably anyone else out there.
