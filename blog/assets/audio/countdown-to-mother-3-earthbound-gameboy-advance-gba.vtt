Countdown to Mother 3!

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.220
Published on March 02, 2006.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.500
In case you don’t know, Mother 3 is the newest in the Mother series of games from Japan.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Mother 2 was released here in the states as “Earthbound” for the SNES.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.440
Anyway, over at the official Mother 3 webpage , they’re doing some kind of time-release teaser site.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.180
Every Tuesday, another present will be unwrapped, whether it be screenshots, game music, or screenshots.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.400
Hey Mother 3 people, get more creative!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.200
Mother 3 is coming to the Gameboy Advance, which means I can play it on my Nintendo DS.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.580
I really liked Earthbound a lot (though not as much as my cousin), so I might import it and struggle through the Japanese to play it.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.440
The graphics are going to be just as spritey as on the SNES version, so I have a feeling this game will be retro RPGing at its best.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.680
Mother 3 will be released in Japan on 4-20-06, so until then, be satisfied with the “presents.”
