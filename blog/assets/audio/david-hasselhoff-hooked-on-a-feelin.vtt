David Hasselhoff – Hooked on a Feelin’

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.660
Published on February 12, 2006.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.020
While browsing my earlier posts, I came across this one that linked to David Hasselhoff’s masterpiece of a music video, Hooked on a Feelin’.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.520
Unfortunately, for some reason David has taken the video off of his website.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.340
Perhaps he wanted to protect his career?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.800
Anyway, I found the video on YouTube, and after all these years, it’s still a great watch:

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.440
https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=PJQVlVHsFF8

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.960
My favorite parts:

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.080
David flying out of a dinner party and into the African Savanna

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.880
David hopping up and down with Africans

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.080
Stupid CG tricks involving a 3D cube

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.120
David flapping his arms and flying with a bunch of birds

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.440
David looking at the side of the boat repeatedly, checking for assassins

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.720
David standing on a motorcycle, and then realizing he doesn’t need one, BECAUSE HE CAN FLY!

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.920
Savanna David singing a duet with flying David

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.680
Eskimo snowboarding David catching a fish and biting into it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.400
Crazy dance immediately following the fish catch

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.080
There’s also bad lip syncing everywhere and some strange puppet thing makes an appearance a few times.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.180
Hooked on a Feelin’ has got to be one of my favorite music videos ever.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.680
I’m glad that I can once again bring this video to you, my loyal reader(s?).
