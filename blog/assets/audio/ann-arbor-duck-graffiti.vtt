Ann Arbor Duck Graffiti

Published on April 14, 2009.

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:11.050
It’s been a while since I noticed this but I hadn’t written a blog post about it yet.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.585
All around Ann Arbor, you can find a distinctly unique signature of “Duck” written on stuff.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:19.163
From mailboxes to walls to whatever.

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:24.297
I think I first noticed it on a paper towel dispenser at BTB Cantina.

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:33.748
I thought it was some kind of trap where once I read it, I had a second to actually “duck” or be hit on the head by a log or something… That obviously wasn’t the case (I didn’t duck).

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:36.666
Does anyone know what the deal is?

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.844
Is Duck a gang?

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:40.303
Can I join?

00:00:40.803 --> 00:00:41.762
Do I want to join?

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:44.579
Is Duck involved in illegal activities?

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.157
Does Duck fight crime?

00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:48.376
I wanna know.
