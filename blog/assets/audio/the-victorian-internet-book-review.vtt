The Victorian Internet – Book Review

00:00:03.658 --> 00:00:05.815
Published on January 16, 2010.

00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:12.089
A book that I read recently, Connected, made reference to another book called The Victorian Internet .

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.786
I checked it out of the library and ended up reading it pretty quickly.

00:00:16.286 --> 00:00:20.921
Despite the name, the Victorian Internet is not a sci-fi alternate history novel.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:25.416
It’s about the history of the internet before the internet: the telegraph.

00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:30.172
Much of the book is centered around how the telegraph came to exist.

00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:39.702
It describes the setup of optical telegraph systems where numerous towers were constructed to the laying of thousands of miles of electrical cable, some across the ocean.

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:42.999
This part of the book was mostly a bore to me.

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:58.045
While it’s nice to know that there was a long process to standardize codes and international regulations, etc, it just isn’t that salient to me. I do, however, appreciate the author’s acknowledgment that there was a lot of bad poetry written about the telegraph. Example:

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:07.676
‘Tis done! The angry sea consents, The nations stand no more apart; With clasped hands the continents, Feel the throbbing of each other’s hearts.

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:17.206
Speed, speed the cable, let it run, A loving girdle round the earth, Till all the nations neath the sun Shall be as brothers of one hearth.

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:23.161
The book actually got interesting once it started explaining how people reacted to the telegraph.

00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:35.489
Maybe it’s a symptom of having gone to a school where sociological and technological problems merge… The name of the book implies that the telegraph had a similar effect in the 1800s that the internet did in the late 1900s.

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:43.101
While I was reading I took note of a few things that the author described about the telegraph network that seemed very applicable today.

00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:51.293
Regarding newspapers, “James Gordon Bennett was one of many who assumed that the telegraph would actually put newspapers out of business.”

00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:58.826
Funny to think that the extinction of newspapers was predicted more than 100 years ago, and extended to lay the blame on the internet.

00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:02.762
In a way, newspapers really do seem like they are going extinct.

00:02:03.262 --> 00:02:07.577
Maybe it’s that the internet is finishing the job, as a natural extension of the telegraph.

00:02:08.577 --> 00:02:11.534
Another chapter describes love by telegraph.

00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:18.347
There’s a story of a couple who were married while 650 miles apart, one in Arizona and the other in California.

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:25.080
Thanks, telegraph! There was also the story of the telegraph operators who were good chums together.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.014
Only once they met in real life did they realize that they were of opposite sex, and got married soon afterwards!

00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:34.551
Sorry, World of Warcraft, but telegraph did it first!

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:49.457
One of the most entertaining descriptions was of a company that “employed thousands of operators … leading to widespread concern that too much power was concentrated in the hands of one company. [It] handled 80 percent of the country’s message traffic and was making a huge profit.”

00:02:49.957 --> 00:02:51.395
Sound like Google?

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:58.048
It was actually Western Union, which seems like it’s being used more for Nigerian scams than legitimate business.

00:02:58.548 --> 00:03:01.825
Though I guess Google sends plenty of Nigerian spam as well…

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:08.339
There are other examples of the internet echoing things that happened a century before it on the telegraph network.

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.275
I’ll leave it to as an exercise to the reader to actually read the book.

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:20.687
The takeaway from reading this book seems to be that the interactions that happen with humans and new enabling technologies were recorded long before the internet.

00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:28.059
History repeats itself, and if we want to know what will happen next with the internet, we might want to see what happened to the telegraph.
