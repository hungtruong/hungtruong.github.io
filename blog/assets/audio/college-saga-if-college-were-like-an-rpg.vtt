College Saga – If College Were Like An RPG

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.820
Published on January 07, 2007.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.060
I stumbled upon this movie called College Saga while reading Kotaku.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.440
It’s a parody of RPGs in a college setting.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.100
The thing is split up into four parts that are about 10 minutes each, so it ends up being a 40 minute movie.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.100
The great part about this movie is that it gets pretty much every gag right.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.200
Like the random NPCs just wandering back and forth, and the girl who says the same thing when you talk to her twice.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:43.740
Or the ludicrousness of some small object blocking your path, or how it seems normal to go into someone’s house (dorm room) and steal all of their stuff…

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.220
The movie makes heavy use of video game music and sound effects.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.960
It’s really sad because I could recognize where almost all of the music came from.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.900
You can watch College Saga in 10 minute bite size chunks, or just watch the whole thing right here:

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.700
This totally reminds me of my UNM RPG that I made for that video game class I took.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.280
I gotta post that online someday…
