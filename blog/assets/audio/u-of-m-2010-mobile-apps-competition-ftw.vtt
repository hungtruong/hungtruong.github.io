Continuing in my tradition of winning contests that I entered with very little expectation of actually winning, I got an email a week or two back about the University of Michigan 2010 Mobile Apps Competition that I entered in November.

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:25.216
The competition is open to students, faculty and staff at the university.

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:31.470
Since I’m working on a part time basis at the university, I figured I would enter a few of my apps.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.445
I chose Checkmate and ♥s Threadless , and made some awkward demo videos of each.

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:44.797
Checkmate ended up winning third place out of many many competitive entries (leaders and the best!), so I’m super happy about that.

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:48.174
Here’s a story in the University Record about it .

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:53.549
The HiJack project that’s been getting a lot of press was the grand prize winner.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:55.886
Props to those guys!

00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:00.802
Winning a prize in this contest was a really nice way to start my year.

00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:05.537
It’s really encouraging me to continue doing mobile apps and exploring what’s possible.
