Blogging Considered Harmful

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.900
Published on April 06, 2008.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.780
Via Venture Beat (who knew?), the New York Times thinks that blogging could be hazardous to your health :

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:22.220
Two weeks ago in North Lauderdale, Fla., funeral services were held for Russell Shaw, a prolific blogger on technology subjects who died at 60 of a heart attack.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.160
In December, another tech blogger, Marc Orchant, died at 50 of a massive coronary.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.220
A third, Om Malik, 41, survived a heart attack in December.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:44.840
Other bloggers complain of weight loss or gain, sleep disorders, exhaustion and other maladies born of the nonstop strain of producing for a news and information cycle that is as always-on as the Internet.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.320
I heard about Om Malik, but I didn’t know two other blogger dudes died of heart attacks.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.540
I guess I can imagine how this happens though.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.680
When I was starting my Anime Blog I wanted it to be successful, so I did spend quite a bit of time thinking about how to get to that point.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.060
After a while though, I just figured that blogging should be for fun, not dollars (even though my blogs actually do make some $$$).

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.380
The article mentioned bloggers either gaining or losing weight due to blogging.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.880
I wonder if there’s a blogging diet!

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.060
If anything, I think blogging has had an opposite effect on me…

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.020
Of course, obsession to anything can be dangerous.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.640
Guys in Korea die of playing WoW all the time!

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.740
Workaholics die from “ Karoshi ,” yes, Japan actually has a word from death by overwork!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.460
Me? I try not to stress out too much.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.760
In fact, I am writing this blog just so I can procrastinate doing homework for one of three things that are due in the next three days!

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.840
Also, Om Malik sounds like the name of some Sith Lord, doesn’t it?
