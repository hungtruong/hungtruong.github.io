Will Wii Rock You? The Nintendo Revolution Gets a Name Change…

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.940
Published on April 28, 2006.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.580
So Nintendo has changed the name of its next-gen console from Revolution to “ Wii .”

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.360
Uh, Wii? So far, the reaction has been pretty tepid.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.820
And by tepid, I mean people hate the name.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.280
There are even conspiracy theories saying that the name is a hoax and they’ll announce the “real” name at E3…

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.080
What do I think?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.900
A name change is not gonna kill the system.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.560
Unless they decided to call it the “Nazi KKK 64” or something like that.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.100
I liked “Revolution,” personally, but whatever.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.380
As long as they release it in lime green, I will buy it (notice the color scheme of my blog?).

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.760
That, and they must have a Mario game at launch.
