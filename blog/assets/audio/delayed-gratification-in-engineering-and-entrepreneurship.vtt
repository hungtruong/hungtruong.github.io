Delayed Gratification in Engineering and Entrepreneurship

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:07.813
Published on April 29, 2011.

00:00:08.813 --> 00:00:18.323
I read a blog post about Engineers and Delayed Gratification a while ago from ex-Googler and ex-Microsoftie Ninane Wang that made me think.

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:26.575
She says that new engineers (like straight from school) have a hard time adjusting to the real world because they expect to be rewarded immediately for their work.

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:31.470
In the real world, you don’t see rewards for your work for months, or even years!

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.283
Her solution is to have managers provide instant feedback to their reports so they get at least some acknowledgment of their work.

00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:47.434
Since quitting Microsoft and setting out on my own (and even before that), I’ve had to trust that the stuff I am working on is meaningful and worthwhile.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:52.010
This is hard sometimes, especially if the thing I’m working on seems like a gamble.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.983
Having done the whole independent hacking thing for a while, I think I’ve built up the rolling reward cycle that Niniane mentions.

00:00:59.483 --> 00:01:04.437
Some days I’ll feel like I’m underachieving or working on something that no one will find useful.

00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:12.929
Then I’ll get a donation from someone for Instascriber (this actually happened!!!) or see another 5 star review for my Threadless app and get re-encouraged.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:21.760
At the end of the day, I think what really separates the employees from the entrepreneurs is the willingness to be unsure about something and still do it.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.932
The uncertainty is much greater when you’re working on an unproven idea, business model, or whatever, but then so are the potential rewards, too.

00:01:30.432 --> 00:01:34.268
And even if you end up failing, you learn something and are better for it .

00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:38.784
In some ways, delaying gratification even sort of makes sense.

00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:47.116
If you immediately were rewarded for doing something innovative, you might lose the passion (like Rocky did) and stop innovating so you can enjoy your riches.

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:55.287
While I can’t say that delaying gratification indefinitely would be a good idea, accepting that there will be a delay is probably healthy.
