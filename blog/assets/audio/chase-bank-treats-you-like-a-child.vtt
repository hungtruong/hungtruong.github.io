Chase Bank Treats You Like A Child

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:06.374
Published on June 10, 2010.

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:11.770
I went to the bank yesterday to fix a $12 fee that shouldn’t have been there.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.706
I kept getting random offers and shit that I really didn’t want to hear.

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:22.279
Like the teller kept trying to show me how to do bill payment through Chase Bank and my credit cards (also through Chase).

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.674
Apparently the reason for the $12 service fee was that my accounts weren’t properly linked.

00:00:28.174 --> 00:00:37.924
The teller asked her manager if the fee could be reversed and then told me that he could reverse the fee if I agreed to be shown how to do the online bill payment (I had to log in on their computer).

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:43.698
I probably should have just threatened to close my accounts, but I didn’t want to waste more time.

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:47.175
Needless to say, the experience wasn’t a good one.

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:51.112
I’m closer to closing my Chase accounts than ever before.

00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:54.249
I’ll probably find a new bank before I do so, though.

00:00:54.749 --> 00:01:02.021
I really hate how pushy Chase is to try and get me to open more accounts, use their stupid bill pay and use their debit cards (which I never do).

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:07.475
The worst thing is that all of these “offers” increase the line wait time and just wastes their customers’ time.

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:10.533
Definitely not the way to do customer service.

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:16.088
Anybody know of a good bank that has branches and ATMs in Southeast Michigan?
