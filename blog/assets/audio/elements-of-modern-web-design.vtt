Elements of Modern Web Design

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.460
Published on February 10, 2006.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.620
I found this link from BoingBoing.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.120
It basically goes through the elements of the more modern web pages out there.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.580
By modern, I really mean shiny and pretty.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.000
There’s some really good info in here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.680
The main idea is to use gradients to smooth things out and whitespace to be easy on the eyes.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.140
I think I might need to work a bit on the latter, myself.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.740
I’ve been trying to make the design of my blog to look somewhat cooler.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.880
So far, the plasticy header and sidebar things are to my liking, but I think there’s probably more I could do.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.380
But first I need to get Photoshop!

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.440
After that, I need some Photoshop skills…

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.200
In related news, my blog in Internet Explorer looks like utter crap.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.540
To fix this, get Firefox.
