New Addition To The Home: Mortimer The Letterpress!

00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:07.813
Published on September 27, 2010.

00:00:08.813 --> 00:00:11.690
As I wrote earlier , I really like letterpress stuff.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.982
I’ve been thinking of getting into it on my own, so I scoured eBay and craigslist looking for a printing press for myself.

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:22.519
I wanted a tabletop press that wasn’t too heavy.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.193
I ended up getting a Kelsey Excelsior 5×8 model from a guy just outside of Lansing.

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:38.483
Emily and I drove over there to pick it up, then we took it to her parent’s place in Grand Rapids where Randy did a super good job fixing it up with WD-40 and oil.

00:00:38.983 --> 00:00:44.098
He also attached it to a piece of wood for easy letterpress action! Thanks, Randy!

00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:51.731
We learned from the seller that this particular press was rescued from a funeral home, where it was used to print memorials and stuff.

00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:57.585
We also found some pre-set type along with the press with words like “DIED” and “INTERNMENT.”

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:02.240
Creepy! I hope no ghosts decide to haunt my press.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.457
Because of its history, I named the press Mortimer.

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:08.274
It also sounds like a good old-timey name.

00:01:08.774 --> 00:01:16.126
The serial number on the press’ chase bed reads “B41D” which tells me that the thing was built in April 1941.

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:21.602
Although I need to buy new rollers for the press, I decided to practice setting type.

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:25.618
I made a pseudo business card and made a blind impression with the type.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:31.552
I made the imprint on some of my old Microsoft business cards (won’t need those ones anymore).

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:37.346
I can’t wait to see what the results look like with ink and paper that’s made for letterpress.

00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:41.522
I also have a few other supplies I need to buy before I’m in business.

00:01:42.022 --> 00:01:44.659
Stay tuned for updates on letterpress stuff!
