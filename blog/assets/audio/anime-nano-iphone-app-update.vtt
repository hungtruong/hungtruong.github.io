Anime Nano iPhone App Update

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:06.774
Published on August 11, 2010.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:12.169
My Anime Nano iPhone app was just approved again for the app store.

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.667
“Approved again?” you ask?

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:17.165
Yes. Here’s the story.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:22.080
I had a mobile startup a while back called Troubadour Mobile.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.373
While the company hasn’t been operating for a while, I was using its iPhone developer account to mess around with submitting stuff to the app store.

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:33.868
I wrote my Anime Nano app and it was pretty cool.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:40.622
I wanted to start getting into other kinds of apps, and I wanted to integrate iAd with Anime Nano.

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:47.196
To do this, I needed to make my own iPhone dev account because I didn’t want to set up the taxes for a defunct company.

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:54.089
I figured it would be a simple process to move an app from one owner to another, because it must happen all the time, right?

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:01.562
I sent in a request to move Anime Nano from Troubadour’s account to my own personal dev account.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.139
That was around the beginning of July.

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:08.395
I didn’t get a reply until the beginning of August, more than a month later.

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:16.886
Unfortunately, between the time I requested the move, my company’s account expired (I wasn’t going to keep paying $100 a year for an account we wouldn’t use).

00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:21.802
When the account expired, my original app was taken off of the iTunes App Store.

00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:29.015
After that happened I just submitted the application again under my own account with a slightly different name (Anime Nano!).

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:32.951
Apparently, the “application transfer” doesn’t really even transfer anything.

00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:38.645
Apple just asked me to remove one of my apps from sale and re-upload the binary.

00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:41.143
So I waited a month for nothing.

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:46.358
This was pretty annoying, because if I had known earlier, I would’ve just done so myself.

00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:50.054
I don’t know why I needed to wait a month to get those instructions.

00:01:51.054 --> 00:01:56.249
Anyway, I submitted the app about a week ago and it was finally approved this afternoon.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.025
I’m happy to say that the iAds work and they look pretty neat.

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:06.139
Anyway, if you haven’t gotten it yet (and actually, if you downloaded it before), go get Anime Nano!

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:11.514
If you have the old version, iTunes won’t know when it’s updated unless you get the new version.
