Have You Heard Of Montreal?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.980
Published on February 24, 2006.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.580
No, not that city in Canada, the band, “ Of Montreal ?”

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.640
I’ve written about them before, but they’re pretty good, so I think they deserve a whole freakin’ post.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.100
In fact, they’re probably my favorite band, at the moment.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.220
My favorite band used to be They Might Be Giants, because of their nerdy lyrics and infectious melodies.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.720
Lately, though, they’ve been veering off course and going into some bad territory.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.780
When every other release from a rock band is a kid’s album, something is wrong.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.480
I have a feeling they’ve sold out, and they’re “over the hill” now, so to speak.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.140
Anyway, back to the band at hand.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.780
Of Montreal is this crazy indie type band that plays just the kind of music I like.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.280
Insane music! The lyrics usually don’t make any sense, and when they do, they form some kind of grandiose plot, kind of like a rock opera.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.420
Many of their song names don’t even make sense.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.320
Just check out the tracklisting for their Early Four Track Recordings album. Weird.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.760
I think their more current albums are more synthesis/electronica based, whereas their older albums are more dirty lo-fi guitar sounding affairs (which isn’t a bad thing).

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.660
Sure, they’re a might bit pretentious, but they’ve got the awesomeness to back it up.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.440
The albums I’ve bought from them are Early Four Track Recordings , and Aldhils Arboretum .

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.620
Both are pretty awesome.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.240
The Gay Parade and Horse & Elephant Eatery (No Elephants Allowed) are also really good.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.320
You can download a ton of MP3s from their website (legally, even!).

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.780
I recommend The Problem With April and Nickee Coco and the Invisible Tree for starters.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.140
It’s really nice to find a band and actually become a fan; Something I haven’t done in quite a while.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.160
I really should actively look for new music to listen to, but I guess I’m kind of lazy when it comes to that.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.140
Maybe I’ll become an Of Montreal expert before I go looking for any more music…
