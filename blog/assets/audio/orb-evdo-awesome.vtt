Orb + EVDO = Awesome!

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.380
Published on May 20, 2007.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.420
I had heard about this Orb thing a while ago.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.000
It’s this program you install that acts as a sort of proxy where you can get your computer to convert and stream on demand any media that’s sitting on it.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.780
I originally had no interest in it, since when I’m away from home, I have my laptop which can provide me with videos and audio and whatnot.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.100
Just recently, I got a Motorola Q and I’ve been trying to figure out what new cool things I can do with it since it’s a smartphone.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.640
Revisiting Orb, the possibilities look promising.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880
I just installed Orb on my computer.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.860
Basically, Orb connects with a central server.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.840
From a website, you can log in and “request” the media that’s sitting on your home computer.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.620
When you “request” something, the local program will start encoding the media at a decent bitrate and stream it to you over the web.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.800
It’s pretty cool, actually.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.280
When I used my phone to try and grab stuff, videos were a bit low (my phone only gets like 78kbs in Albuquerque), but audio was ok.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.460
When I move to Ann Arbor, the bitrate should improve by a lot, since there’s EVDO coverage there.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.800
When I plugged my phone into the computer and used the local connection, the videos were surprisingly high quality.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.500
It was really cool watching a video on my phone like that.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.180
I probably won’t use it much while I’m here, but once I get to Ann Arbor I’d like to test the feasibility of watching tv shows on my phone from anywhere.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.100
There is an issue of privacy since you allow the Orb software to index all of the files on your computer and list them online (it’s password protected).

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.920
The privacy terms seem okay though.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.540
I’d prefer a totally direct method of connection though, instead of relying on Orb to keep my privacy.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.280
Not that I’m doing anything illegal.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.300
It’s the principal of the thing.
