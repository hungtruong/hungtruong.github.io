Did Library School Change Me?

00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:06.614
Published on July 27, 2009.

00:00:07.614 --> 00:00:16.245
Looking back on my old posts from before I went to school at a hybrid Information/Library Science school, my opinions of librarians seemed fueled by a bit of prejudice.

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:19.862
For example, in my visiting days post I wrote:

00:00:20.862 --> 00:00:24.378
I sat down at a table whose occupants were librarians.

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:29.273
Pretty much everyone there was an LIS (library and information services) specialist.

00:00:29.773 --> 00:00:39.443
This wasn’t really a great first impression, since I applied under the HCI (human-computer interaction) specialization, and to be honest, libraries aren’t really my thing.

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:43.959
What, exactly, did I have against librarians and libraries?

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:54.448
I think I mostly felt that, from the school’s website (or the parts of the website that I studied), the program was more for people who were generally interested in information from a more technology-oriented viewpoint.

00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:58.624
So I was hoping to see more technological-minded folks at my table.

00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:02.661
I still, however, decided to enroll.

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:04.839
And I’m glad I did.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.095
Slowly, I think I started to understand what libraries are all about.

00:01:09.595 --> 00:01:11.752
I started using the local library .

00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:17.526
A lot. It probably also helped that I worked at a library my entire time at the school.

00:01:18.026 --> 00:01:22.342
I wasn’t studying to be a librarian, but I was exposed to the culture.

00:01:22.842 --> 00:01:25.878
Computer nerds and librarians make a good team.

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.956
So did library school actually change me?

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:34.330
Or was I somehow intrinsically drawn to the program where computer nerds and book nerds collide?

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.429
Maybe a little of both.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.643
I’ve always had a secret love for organizing and archiving things.

00:01:42.643 --> 00:01:48.077
For example, pretty much no one in my family seems to care much about backing up files.

00:01:48.577 --> 00:01:51.374
I, on the hand, am a bit obsessed about it.

00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:57.708
I still have files from middle school preserved in their original file formats and directory structure in place.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:01.404
Who knows, some day I might want to look back on that stuff.

00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:08.457
I’m also kind of a nut when it comes to properly organizing and applying metadata (and preserving said metadata) from photos.

00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:14.791
Oh, and also backing everything up, both on-site and off-site (using multiple online services).

00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:19.866
I also get really irritated when I go to the library and see something like this:

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:25.741
Is that a Drama and Horror blu-ray disc I see mixed in with the Action ones!?

00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:29.277
Usually I will take the offending discs and put them in the right place.

00:02:29.777 --> 00:02:34.492
There was also that one time I saw Harry Potter in Comedy when it should have gone in Fantasy .

00:02:34.992 --> 00:02:38.109
The worst is when a DVD gets mixed in with blu-ray.

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.885
That’s like the same as a book being in the CD section!

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:44.543
Oh man, now I’m rambling.

00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:51.057
The point is, I think I already had some Librarian/Archivist in me before coming to library school.

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:55.952
Hanging out with like-minded people probably reinforced the behavior mentioned above.

00:02:56.452 --> 00:02:57.890
And probably for the better.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.545
If you’re a computer nerd, I suggest you check out libraries (and librarians!).

00:03:03.045 --> 00:03:07.680
If you’re a library nerd, I suggest you check out computer nerd stuff (and computer nerds!).

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.537
Together, we can make the world a more information-y place.
