How Low Can Wegovy?

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:06.655
Published on January 22, 2026.

00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:16.506
I recently started taking one of these trendy weight loss pills, and since my blog always gets spam comments from people trying to sell the stuff, I figured I could just make a whole post about it.

00:00:16.506 --> 00:00:21.421
That way the rest of my blog posts will be safe from spam, right?

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:26.796
It’s been about a week since I started taking the wegovy pill which just came out this year.

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:30.812
I think I literally got it about a week after it was officially available.

00:00:30.812 --> 00:00:36.746
I had seen an article about how this new oral form was recently approved, and I did a bit of research on it.

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:45.418
Before that, I had been pretty uninterested in taking it, but the more I read about how the drug actually worked, the more interested I was in it.

00:00:45.418 --> 00:00:48.036
#myweightlossjourney™

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:57.028
If you’re tired of reading about people’s struggles with weight loss, etc, you can probably skip this part, I’m just including it because maybe it’s relevant later?

00:00:57.028 --> 00:01:00.804
I’ve always felt overweight, ever since I was a kid.

00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:04.261
Probably because I was pretty fat as a kid.

00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:19.147
I attribute this to a few things, one being that I was taught to always finish all of my food (my grandma would tell us that for every grain of rice we wasted, we would have to eat a maggot when we died and went to heaven (or hell?)) and also that I really love eating food!

00:01:19.147 --> 00:01:23.482
Also my mom would buy me hella snacks from our membership at Costco.

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:27.439
I had a pretty dope childhood tbh.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.934
There’s a lot of research about obesity and who knows what the actual causes are.

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:35.391
It’s not like I blame my family for being fat or anything.

00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:46.621
I think our society loves to blame individuals for being overweight, but it’s probably some combination of environment plus personal choices plus OMG DORITOS ARE SO FUCKING DELICIOUS!

00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:52.794
Anyway, I’ve tried to lose weight with many different techniques in the past, with varying levels of success.

00:01:52.794 --> 00:02:00.087
I tried playing DDR (yes, really), I did Keto for a few years but it really sucked, especially as a vegetarian.

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:03.464
I wrote a freakin’ app to track my bike rides!

00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:05.961
I’ve also tried just eating less.

00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:16.232
I think the problem with these diets is that they’re so far from what my baseline of what I naturally want to do is, that I’ll just start gaining weight again once I stop doing the special thing.

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:21.367
Recently I decided to care less about weight and more about fitness.

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:31.057
About 1.5 years ago, I started strength training with weights and also exercising on a Concept2 RowErg (just name dropping this brand, iykyk).

00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:38.929
I think it’s been good for my general health levels, but it’s probably not a great idea to go into bulk mode for a year and a half without cutting…

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.706
Anyway, this gets us to the current state of things.

00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:51.917
My vitals look pretty good, e.g. my resting heart rate has been looking great, and I honestly feel healthier than I did when I was 10 years younger due to being more active.

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:56.652
But I figured that there are also negative health outcomes that are more likely with a higher BMI.

00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:59.410
So let’s try something different!

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.668
You Down With GLP?

00:03:02.668 --> 00:03:09.161
I mentioned doing research on Semaglutide drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy and Rybelsus.

00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:15.575
I had previously read something about how they just make you hate eating which sounds horrible, so I figured they weren’t for me.

00:03:15.575 --> 00:03:18.732
The truth is a bit more nuanced, though.

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:26.904
From what I understand (from asking AI), the drugs work by making you digest stuff more slowly, along with controlling your insulin production.

00:03:26.904 --> 00:03:31.480
These two things can help you lose weight because they even out your hunger levels.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.192
I think I’m usually pretty good about not overeating my main meals, but I do have a serious snacking problem, so this helps a lot.

00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:46.245
There are some other health benefits, like reduced chance of heart issues and less inflammation, which seems like a bonus.

00:03:46.245 --> 00:03:53.479
But whenever I look at holistic medicine, technically everything seems to reduce inflammation, so ¯\(ツ)/¯ ?

00:03:53.479 --> 00:04:00.132
There are some risks are kidney and gallbladder stuff, and some rare Thyroid cancer, I guess.

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:06.166
I mean, if you’re looking for more info on this drug, you can do a better job than checking this blog!

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:14.818
I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect when I started, but many forum posts mention nausea and other digestive issues as the main side effect.

00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:17.235
Luckily, I haven’t had too much of that.

00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:25.407
I think that the nausea is mainly due to people eating like normal when their body is digesting more slowly, so it causes a food backup.

00:04:25.407 --> 00:04:35.678
Even before starting on the drug (while I was waiting for my prescription to be filled), I started being more mindful about my portions, and basically got ready to eat less.

00:04:35.678 --> 00:04:39.495
Sema-glutide Kind of Life

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:47.128
So after a week of being on this “miracle drug,” here’s my impressions (this is probably the part you wanted to read).

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:57.777
I did notice that my head felt a bit fuzzy, maybe due to how the drug messes with your glucose levels, and at night I actually felt cold (I sleep super hot) which was very different for me.

00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:01.654
Those side effects have seemed to wane over the week, though.

00:05:01.654 --> 00:05:10.865
In terms of my fitness plan, I was concerned that my pumps wouldn’t be as good, but I actually did a bit better than the previous week when I finally decided to pump some iron.

00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:20.155
When I used the rowing machine, I noticed that I felt a bit less energy towards the end of my workout, but my muscles also didn’t feel as sore as they usually do at the end.

00:05:20.155 --> 00:05:24.671
So overall, I don’t think the drug had too much of an effect, which is great.

00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:28.528
So generally speaking, my first week on this drug has been pretty good!

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:36.300
The main thing that I’ve noticed is that I don’t really have a desire to eat junk food, either sweet or salty, which I used to have a weakness for.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.716
I had predicted that this would make me sad, but surprisingly it doesn’t.

00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:49.547
My sentiment was even echoed in some Reddit posts I found about people talking about their “last meal” before going on the drug, like they were on death row!

00:05:49.547 --> 00:06:01.396
I definitely felt some joy in smashing a whole bag of Doritos (I swear this blog post isn’t sponsored by them), but that’s also balanced out by the feeling of being a pig and also potential tummy aches later.

00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:14.463
In retrospect, it sounds kind of silly that I would miss having the urge to binge on snacks, because that’s like saying I would miss the addiction of smoking meth or shooting up heroin (I haven’t tried either yet so maybe I would?).

00:06:14.463 --> 00:06:19.199
My initial fear of not enjoying food also seems to have been misguided.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.694
Food still tastes good to me (at least on my current starter dose).

00:06:23.694 --> 00:06:27.071
I just eat less of it before I feel satisfied with it.

00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:31.167
And once I’m satisfied, why would I want more?

00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:38.480
Without the drug, that satisfaction is elusive, or it never comes, and then you realize you ate a whole frozen pizza.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.213
One weird thing that healthy people tell fat people is that they just need to start enjoying healthy food.

00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:49.389
But I don’t think that really comes naturally, otherwise they wouldn’t be fat.

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.204
One thing I’ve noticed is that my perception of food has changed for whatever reason.

00:06:54.204 --> 00:07:00.458
I noticed while having a veggie burger and fries that the Heinz ketchup I used tasted super sweet.

00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:02.956
It was almost too sweet!

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:10.009
Earlier that day I noticed that some honey flavored Greek Yogurt that I’ve had in the past tasted way sweeter than before.

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.264
It definitely threw me off and made me wonder if I should even be eating it.

00:07:14.264 --> 00:07:16.522
Even an Apple tasted like candy.

00:07:16.522 --> 00:07:26.153
(Editor’s note, I’m so used to capitalizing Apple that I did it here even though I’m talking about the fruit. I’m leaving it in because it’s funny)

00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:31.128
I think this is what “healthy” people mean when they’re talking down to fat people about eating “healthy.”

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:39.939
My suspicion is that there’s a biological/scientific component and it’s not just about fat people being dumb and lazy and eating like shit for no reason.

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:46.933
I realize how obvious that sounds but that’s also the way fat people are treated in real life, so…

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:52.867
I remember trying an organic ketchup brand once, it was probably the Portland one, and thinking it was disgusting.

00:07:52.867 --> 00:07:56.084
It was probably because it wasn’t sweet enough!

00:07:56.084 --> 00:07:59.700
I should try that brand again and see if it tastes better to me now.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:08.032
I looked it up and the Heinz ketchup has 5g of carb vs. 3g for the Portland one, with the same serving size of 17g.

00:08:08.032 --> 00:08:13.587
So ignoring rounding errors that’s like 66% more carbs in the Heinz version!

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:17.843
Apart from hardly snacking, I’ve also been eating more thoughtfully.

00:08:17.843 --> 00:08:26.414
Keep in mind these are all things that a person can do without a drug, but that’s like saying anyone can climb Mt. Everest while also not being a psychopath.

00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:31.389
I’ve been eating more slowly and thinking about how full I am while eating meals.

00:08:31.389 --> 00:08:38.602
My portion sizes have never been a huge issue but I’ve been decreasing them a bit just to see if I feel full on less food.

00:08:38.602 --> 00:08:44.856
Sometimes I would eat an extra slice of pizza just because it tasted good, not because I was actually hungry.

00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:52.089
I don’t feel the need to do that anymore, and besides, it would probably make me feel sick with the slower digestion anyway.

00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:56.824
As I’ve been running on a caloric deficit, I have been feeling more fatigued.

00:08:56.824 --> 00:09:05.396
This felt stronger earlier in the week, and I don’t feel as tired today, so hopefully this is another side effect that goes away as my body gets used to it.

00:09:05.396 --> 00:09:12.149
I’ll probably keep feeling some amount of fatigue while I’m losing weight but that should probably come with the territory.

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:16.805
Based on the vibes above, I think that the first week would be a success.

00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:20.661
But you know I’m a very numbers oriented kinda guy.

00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:24.917
This week I lost 2 pounds, which is probably mostly water weight.

00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:36.925
Since I’m on the lowest starter dose (you’re supposed to go up every month), I don’t expect to lose everything right away, but based on the changes to my habits, I could also see myself being pretty successful just staying on this same dose, too.

00:09:36.925 --> 00:09:45.357
I’ve heard of people not losing weight until going up in dose, but maybe they have more obstacles to overcome than I do.

00:09:45.357 --> 00:09:48.615
Where Do Wegovy Now?

00:09:48.615 --> 00:09:51.592
So far, the results seem pretty good.

00:09:51.592 --> 00:09:57.207
I’m not surprised since these drugs have made a huge impact on society long before I started taking them.

00:09:57.207 --> 00:10:03.561
I’ll probably keep chugging along on these until I hit a goal that I feel comfortable with and see what I should do from there.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:11.013
There’s been a lot of debate about whether these drugs are the sort of thing you take permanently, or if you can stop taking them when you’re not fat anymore.

00:10:11.013 --> 00:10:17.427
My guess is that some people will probably need to keep taking them, otherwise they could just rebound back to their original weight.

00:10:17.427 --> 00:10:23.840
I also think that the drug could also help people start healthier habits that turn into long term success.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.998
So it probably just depends on the person.

00:10:26.998 --> 00:10:35.409
I’ve also seen a lot of distrust about the drug, which seems to stem from feeling like using it is “cheating” or “the easy way.”

00:10:35.409 --> 00:10:39.186
People want fat people to stay fat so they can feel superior to them.

00:10:39.186 --> 00:10:44.181
Gatekeeping better health seems like a weird thing to want, but okay!

00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:52.353
On top of losing weight, I do feel like there have been some interesting insights that I’ve gotten just from altering how hungry I feel.

00:10:52.353 --> 00:11:03.562
I do hope that more people get a chance to try this themselves, if they want to, and I’m not just saying that because this post is a advertisement paid for by “Big GLP” (that was a pun btw, please clap).

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:12.613
It’s really interesting to experience how (in my imagination) a normal person interacts with food, versus someone who hasn’t always had a healthy relationship with it.

00:11:12.613 --> 00:11:21.664
It would also be kind of interesting if there was a reverse drug that made people hungry all the time, which non-fat people could take so they’d know how fat people feel.

00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:26.260
I’m sure Novo Nordisk is working on it as I’m writing this!

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:38.668
I’ve read articles about how companies are changing their products for customers due to GLP-1 drugs (maybe that’s why everything advertises their protein content now?), so there does seem to be a shift happening in the economy.

00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:43.983
It might be a good time to short Frito Lay and maybe buy Dole stock, who knows?

00:11:43.983 --> 00:11:48.958
Anyway, maybe I’ll give an update in a bit to see how #myweightlossjourney™ goes.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:54.273
I’m a bit worried that I’ve used up all the good puns but I have some time to come up with more.
