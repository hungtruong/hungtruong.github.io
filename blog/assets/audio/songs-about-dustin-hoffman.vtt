Published on November 06, 2005.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.300
So I got my iTunes $10 gift certificate from Blingo.com the other day, and I finally used it to buy some music.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:22.680
I was gonna buy a iTunes exclusive TMBG album, but then I decided on getting some albums from that band, Of Montreal , that I blogged about earlier .

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.180
The albums I got are “Early Four Track Recordings” and “Aldhils Arboretum.”

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.240
They were both only $4.49 each!

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.460
The former has some interesting track titles.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.320
Here they are:

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.040
Dirty Dustin Hoffman Needs A Bath

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.200

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.560

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.160

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.200
Seriously, how could I make this shit up even if I wanted to!?

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.300
Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), the songs’ contents don’t really have anything to do with Dustin Hoffman .

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.360
Even so, the songs are pretty cool, and I dig em, so I’m pretty happy with my “purchase.”

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.540
You should check em out if you’re weird and/or you like weird ass music.
