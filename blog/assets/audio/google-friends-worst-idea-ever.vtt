Google “Friends” = Worst Idea Ever

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.540
Published on December 20, 2007.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.780
Maybe I’m just in a bad mood this week.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.160
Or maybe software is just getting ridiculously stupid.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.440
I use Google Reader as an RSS Feed reader.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.900
They recently introduced a “ feature ” where you can see stuff from your “friend’s” RSS subscriptions.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.440
Google has the idiotic idea that anyone you chat with on Gtalk or email is a friend.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.680
Google doesn’t ask you who you friends are, they just have some algorithm to determine it.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.060
An algorithm. To determine who your friends are.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:47.660
While I am very confident in certain algorithms (like say, Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm ), I believe it’s quite easy to figure out who one’s friends are by FUCKING ASKING THE PERSON!

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.660
The worst part is, in order to remove these stupid stories, you must delete these people from your contacts list.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.640
So really, there’s an extreme binary relationship: either you are someone’s friend and you email them, or you are not their friend and you will never email them, ever.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.800
Google will not be able to beat Facebook at social software if they can’t figure out how to ask someone who their friends are.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.820
This move shows an utter lack of understanding of human nature.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.520
Google thinks they can solve things mathematically when asking a user will completely suffice.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.740
The algorithm-worship there has seriously got to stop.
