Yahoo’s Job Site == Fail

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.980
Published on October 08, 2008.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.820
So I’m looking at jobs and stuff, and I’m also applying for something at Yahoo.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.620
Most employers’ job sites are pretty bad.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.200
I’m not sure why, but it seems that companies think that if the company is good enough, people will try to apply for jobs no matter how bad the actual process is.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.620
I’ve seen good implementations in the past as well as horrible ones.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.880
Google’s is actually not too bad (upload your resume and transcript, pdf is okay) while Yahoo’s is probably the worst.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.160
First off, when I talked to a recruiter from Yahoo at Michigan, I was told that as a “green” measure, Yahoo wasn’t taking paper resumes.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.500
Okay, that’s pretty cool, I guess.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.160
Power to the Purple.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.460
But then I attempted to actually apply online.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.420
The Yahoo careers site doesn’t take pdfs.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.880
It doesn’t take .

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.300
pages either (which makes sense because those are actually directories!).

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.000
So I convert the .

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.580
pages to .doc and upload it.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.680
For some reason, the random filler stuff from the template (latin words, etc) makes it into the parser and pre-fills my resume with junk.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.420
Also, I found it very funny that the Yahoo resume parser thinks “Ann Arbor” is my name, and not my city!

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.460
Another thing I noticed is that there’s a list of universities, but for some reason, it’s only the big ones.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.600
University of New Mexico is not on there.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.380
Luckily for me, I’m going to a big-name school now!

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.600
There’s also a field for “Other University.”

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.540
Way to make community college kids feel good, Yahoo.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.780
Finally, in order to get my resume in there, I have to copy and paste.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.600
That’s right, COPY AND PASTE.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.900
All the formatting I did to make my resume easy to read and cool-looking has gone down the drain.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.680
Getting resumes that are easy to read is apparently not important to Yahoo.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.440
You might think that I would hold my tongue since I’m applying at Yahoo.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.660
But seriously, the Yahoo Careers Site is horrible.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.800
It needs work.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:20.620
I’m sure Yahoo is a fine place for a career; I’m also sure that Yahoo would be happy that its (prospective) employees would call a spade a spade, and recognize when there’s a problem with the site.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.020
Who knows, I might even end up fixing the Careers site as my first gig at Yahoo.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.640
That is, if they’re willing to hire someone who can see problems and is not afraid to point them out.
