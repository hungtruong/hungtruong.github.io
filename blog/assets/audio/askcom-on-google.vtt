Ask.com on Google?

When I searched for ‘prime numbers’ just now on Google, the first hit was a sponsored link for Ask.com.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.880
You would think it’s a conflict of interest for Google to be suggesting a competitor to its users.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.580
When you think about it, though, Google is also taking money from Ask.com, literally!

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:33.140
It’s especially strange seeing Ask.com advertising on Google so soon after being criticized for launching a guerrilla negative ad campaign against them…
