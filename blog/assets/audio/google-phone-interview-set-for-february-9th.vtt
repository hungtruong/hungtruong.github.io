Google Phone Interview Set For February 9th!

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.940
Published on February 05, 2007.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.300
I got an email from the recruiter at Google today.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.920
My phone interview is set for February 9th, so I have 4 good days to get ready for it.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:25.420
I’ve been looking at the giant algorithms book , just refreshing myself on stuff like O notation, common sorting algorithms like mergesort, and stuff like that.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:36.020
I should probably move on to more complicated algorthms next like Dijkstra’s Algorithm and dynamic programming algorithms like the all pairs shortest path algorithm .

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:47.160
I don’t think Google would ask me about specific implmentations of these, but it would be good practice to get back into the mindset of designing algorithms this complex, since I haven’t had to do so in a while.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:58.560
I saw a sample interview question from some blog asking about defining a function f(a,b) to return a string that is all of the characters in a (in order) that are also in b.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.300
They ask for an order n 2 as well as an order n algorithm.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:17.800
The n 2 one seems trivial, but I can’t think of how to calculate a set intersection (which is what I think the problem boils down to) in order n time… I could try and prove that it would be impossible to do it in n time, but I don’t really want to do that either.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.700
Plus I’m not sure if it is impossible…

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.740
Edit: Okay, so apparently they’re “strings” for a reason.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.240
The N solution is pretty easy.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.620
I was trying to solve a more complex problem in N, when I just needed to take a look at the actual question being asked.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.720
I guess I should do regular sanity checks during the interview and not try to accomplish more than they ask.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.040
Well, back to the book for me.
