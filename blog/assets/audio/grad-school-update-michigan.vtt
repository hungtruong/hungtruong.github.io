Grad School Update: Michigan

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.100
Published on March 01, 2007.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.300
I was accepted to the University of Michigan School of Information a few days ago, and I just got an email regarding my scholarship.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.640
They’re offering me a half tuition merit scholarship which reduces my tuition to the same that a resident would pay (around $7000 a semester).

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.840
This is pretty cool!

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.380
They’re also going to pay for me to fly over there and visit the school on March 24-26.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.120
I have the Google College Day thing on the 23rd though.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.340
Maybe I can just fly over there directly from California.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.440
I’m gonna be tired when I get back!

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.280
As for the whole grad school thing, if the Google thing works out, I may decide to not go to grad school.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.500
I’m definitely keeping my options open, though.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.880
The scholarship offer from Michigan makes it feasible (at least, I think) for me to go to school there.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.180
If I get some kind of assistantship or maybe a paid internship (Google has an office in Ann Arbor), I could make it work.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.620
All in all, I’m very happy to have options, as they help to keep my stress levels down (if one thing doesn’t work I could go to the next, etc).

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.360
I’ll post updates as soon as I get them.
