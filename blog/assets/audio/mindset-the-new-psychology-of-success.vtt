Mindset: The New Psychology of Success

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:07.573
Published on May 23, 2009.

00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:12.888
A while back I wrote a post about rejection and how I dealt with it.

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:17.384
I also mentioned a book that I had on hold at the library that seemed kinda related.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.121
I got the book and read about half of it.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.658
Then I got really busy and had to return the book.

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:27.514
After putting it on hold again and getting it back I finished it.

00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:34.247
So here’s my thoughts (I’m totally a completist so I really have to read the ENTIRE book before I count it as finished).

00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:40.442
Mindset: The New Psychology of Success , has a really simple message behind it.

00:00:40.942 --> 00:00:46.296
Depending on your perspective, or “mindset” on life, you can really affect your own learning and personal growth.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:51.990
Basically, people with a “fixed” mindset believe that a person’s qualities are predetermined and set in stone.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.844
So people who are good at math won’t fail and those who are bad at math will never be good at it.

00:00:58.344 --> 00:01:05.936
Conversely, people with a “growth” mindset will understand that with practice and reflection, people can improve in just about any measurable quality.

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:11.950
They see failure as a challenge and thrive on improving themselves rather than proving their superiority.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.325
(quick anime example: Rock Lee is totally growth and Sasuke is totally fixed)

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:24.718
I suppose I’ve been trying hard to adapt to the growth mindset, even before reading this book (see this post for more on that).

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:32.650
Previously I think I probably did have a sort of fixed mindset in that I felt I was pretty smart and got through all of high school fairly easily.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.664
In college I stumbled a little bit because Computer Science forced me to think in ways I wasn’t used to thinking.

00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:45.157
I came into an intro course that had hundreds of students of which, by the end, only a fraction remained.

00:01:45.657 --> 00:01:48.694
I made friends with a guy who had programmed all his life.

00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:52.230
Another one of my friends had never programmed before.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.363
The experienced guy did well on talent, my other friend dropped saying it was too hard and I had to work really hard to keep up.

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:08.494
Though at the time I felt a bit inferior to everyone else because I actually had to study hard and struggle, looking back I’m really proud of what I accomplished.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:16.426
Computer Science courses basically taught me that with hard work, I could understand really complicated problems and work out solutions.

00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:20.383
As for the book itself, It’s very easy to read.

00:02:20.883 --> 00:02:23.280
In fact, I think it might be a little too easy to read.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.495
I think I spent too much time in the past two years reading nothing but academic papers.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:35.148
While I appreciate the colloquial language of the book, it feels sometimes like I’m being written down to.

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:40.043
Also, some of the examples and suggestions seem really cheesy, for lack of a better word.

00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:47.736
Example: If your child displays a fixed mindset, turn dinner into a conversation on how each family member learned something.

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:52.071
Soon the kid will be policing you and making sure you show a growth mindset!

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:56.647
Sounds like a scene from Family Circus (not the Nietzsche version ).

00:02:57.647 --> 00:03:01.962
I’d also have to say that the first few chapters really contain the meat of the book.

00:03:02.462 --> 00:03:10.453
They explain the two mindsets, give examples of each in action and spell out how each one affects a person’s outlook on learning and growth.

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:21.183
After the third chapter or so, the book just goes into examples of the mindsets in different contexts: sports, business, relationships, parenting.

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:26.158
A good deal of these chapters feels really redundant and a little boring, honestly.

00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:33.690
I guess they’re useful in reinforcing the ideas, but not completely necessary if you actually read the first three chapters.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.346
The last chapter is a workshop of sorts for changing your own mindset.

00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:40.923
I’d say it’s worth a read as well.

00:03:41.923 --> 00:03:48.156
Overall, I think the book is an interesting read and the concepts it introduces have a lot of potential.

00:03:48.656 --> 00:03:57.207
I wouldn’t label the book as self-help; it’s more of a psychology book that you can actually apply in your own life (sort of like Stumbling on Happiness ).

00:03:57.707 --> 00:04:03.461
At the very least, it’s made me more perceptive of how I react to situations as well as how others around me react.
