MapsKrieg in a Mashup Contest – Vote For Me!

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.860
Published on May 04, 2008.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.100
I keep forgetting to mention this.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.400
A while back there was this cryptic ad on Facebook about mashups and it led to a Dice.com sponsored contest.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.100
I figured I would enter MapsKrieg and I sort of forgot about it.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.560
Checking the visitor stats, I noticed some people were coming from a contest poll page.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.500
So MapsKrieg was chosen as a finalist in this contest!

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.780
The prize is $4000, which is pretty neat.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.640
So please check out the finalists and vote (preferably for me)!

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.700
Mine is #2, “Home & Apartments.”

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.400
I wonder why they just didn’t label it “MapsKrieg?”
