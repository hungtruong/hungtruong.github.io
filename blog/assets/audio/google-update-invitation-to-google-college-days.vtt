Google Update: Invitation to Google College Days

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.660
Published on February 19, 2007.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.100
So I got an email back from Google the Monday after my interview, but I hadn’t posted anything about it.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.920
They invited me to their Google College Days, which I’ve actually never heard of before.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.860
It seems pretty cool.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.440
Here’s part of the email they sent:

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:32.280
Congratulations, your on-campus interviews went well and we would like to invite you to Google’s Headquarters in Mountain View, CA for a College Day!

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.100
Google College Days are fun!

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.120
We’ll fly you out before the interviews, provide lodging and transport you to Google on Friday morning for a full day visit and then fly you back home.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.260
You’ll be on site from 8:45 AM - 3:15 PM on Friday.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.400

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.800
This is way too cool.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.820
I think it’s the dream of every nerd to visit the Googleplex , and to be flown out there (for free) for a tour, food, and interviews is just plain awesome.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.120
The fact that they’re interviewing me for a position is like icing on the cake for a nerd like myself.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.020
I wonder if I’ll be allowed to take pictures… It’d make an awesome blog post.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.980
I’ll be attending their March 23rd one, since it’s the date with the least conflict for me.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.520
Hopefully everything will go well and I’ll be able to visit the Googleplex on a more regular basis.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.300
Like every weekday or so…
