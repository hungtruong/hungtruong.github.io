Man, has my blog become the T-Shirt Blog or what?

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.720
Anyway, Thinkgeek.com is having a clearance of sorts on their shirts.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.740
You just pick how many shirts you want and they send you random ones.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.700
I like most of their shirts, so this is sort of a no brainer for me. I ordered 3.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.720
Hopefully they’ll all be unique, and not 3 STFU shirts.
