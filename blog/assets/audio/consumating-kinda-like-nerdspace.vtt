So I was perusing digg.com, and I came across a post about consumating.com.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.600
It’s sort of this social networking thing for people who are nerds.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.820
Okay, maybe a better word to use would be geeks.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.280
Not geeks in the carnival chicken head-biter sense, but in the geek chic kinda sense.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.740
I joined, because it seemed ‘aight.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.080
I know most of my readers are not nerds, but I have a feeling that this site will probably take over myspace and facebook as my personal #1 time waster.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.100
Check out my profile , and tag me as hot or something, will ya!?
