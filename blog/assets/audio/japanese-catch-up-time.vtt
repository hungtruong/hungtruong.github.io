Japanese Catch Up Time!

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.500
Published on March 23, 2006.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.500
So during my basketball band absence, I missed a lot of class.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.080
In fact, I almost forgot which room one of my classes was in when I came back.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.580
Seriously. Anyway, I’ve got tons of Japanese homework to make up, so here I am, writing a blog about it!

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.700
Actually, I’ve already done 2 of 6 required homeworks, and my brain is pretty much dead.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.440
Learning languages takes quantity studying, not quality.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.020
That is, it’s better to study Japanese 3 times for 20 minutes than once for 60 minutes.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.680
So I’m gonna slowly catch up.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.760
Also, I don’t think our teacher really cares if I turn stuff in somewhat late.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.580
She didn’t even realize I wasn’t there on Monday!

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.880
Of course, she also routinely mixes me up with another Asian that’s in the class, so whatever.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.580
You’d think she could tell our kind apart, what with her whole field of study being ASIANS!

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.340
Am I ranting now?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.520
That means it’s sleepy time!
