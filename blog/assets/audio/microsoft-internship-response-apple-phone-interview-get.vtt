Microsoft Internship Response + Apple Phone Interview Get!

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.060
Published on February 09, 2008.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.460
I heard back from the Microsoft person.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.400
Apparently they think I have “great potential,” yet they don’t want to continue with the interview process.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.820
Which is just the kind of corporate doublespeak I’d expect from a place like Microsoft.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.080
I think it’s unfair to judge a company as large as Microsoft by pigeonholing it into a “good” or “bad” category.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.460
But let’s just say things are not looking good for the company.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.800
First they seem to be losing the Yahoo takeover, then they reject me.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.260
Don’t worry, there’s some sarcasm in there! A little.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.460
In other news, I just got an email from Apple for an internship in their iPhone software group.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.600
Cool! I think that would be the best fit as any with me + Apple since I’m not too into the low level details of OS coding.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.500
But doing iPhone software would be really cool!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.400
The listing on the website didn’t mention any kind of internship in iPhone, so I’m glad I took a chance and talked to the Apple booth when I went to the engineering career fair last week.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.880
I still haven’t heard back from Zazzle but it’s still early in the internship game.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.420
Actually, I haven’t heard back from many companies.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.320
I’m not really sweating it or anything though.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.740
I’ll find something to do during the Summer, even if it’s not with a company.
