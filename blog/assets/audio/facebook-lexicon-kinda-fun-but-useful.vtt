Facebook Lexicon: Kinda Fun, But Useful?

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.260
Published on April 21, 2008.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.420
Facebook just recently released a fun new thingy called Lexicon.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.160
It shows you a graph of the occurrences of certain words or phrases over time on all Facebook walls.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.660
Since I do quite a lot of research using Facebook , I thought I’d take a look at it.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.620
Facebook has some suggested phrase pairs that you can use such as “party tonight” and “hungover.”

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.880
And as expected, the phrases are cyclical and you tend to see a spike in “hungover” the day after “party tonight.”

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.140
But it’s worth noting that you can’t prove causation by just correlation.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.460
What’s a little strange is that there doesn’t seem to be any growth going on in Facebook.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.440
Maybe they’ve normalized the data so you can spot trends, but you’d kind of assume that word counts would trend towards going up since Facebook is still supposedly growing.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.100
Or is Lexicon telling us something Facebook doesn’t want us to know about their growth?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.100
Anyway, at least one question of the ages has been put to rest.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.040
According to Lexicon, shampoo really is better than conditioner.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.460
STOP LOOKING AT ME, SWAN!

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700
Bonus Analysis:

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.180
It looks like the word “happy” is used more on holidays like New Year’s Day and Valentine’s Day.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.360
But the word “merry” is kind of exclusively used on Christmas.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.540
See that strangely unhappy day near the beginning of March?

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.040
Since it’s a leap year, Feb 29th was included in this graph.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.540
And since less people statistically have birthdays on that leap day, the word “happy” was recorded less.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.480
Pretty neat stuff, huh?

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.380
I’m sure there’s other fun stuff to dig out of Lexicon, if you were really inclined to.
