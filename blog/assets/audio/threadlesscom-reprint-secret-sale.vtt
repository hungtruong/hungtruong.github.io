Threadless.com Reprint! + Secret Sale!

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.820
Published on February 20, 2006.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.500
Hey! So “ Captain Awesome ” got reprinted at threadless.com .

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.200
But you know what?

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.140
I didn’t buy it.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.280
For some reason, once it was available, I realized that I wouldn’t really ever wear that shirt in public.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.460
In this case, the wanting was more desirable than the having.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.960
Just like T’Pring in Amok Time!

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.340
(If you got that reference, huge nerd props to you!)

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.380
I like the design, for sure, but it’s just not a shirt.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.440
It would be a cool poster or something though.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.840
I did, however buy some shirts.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.140
3, in fact.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.520
Why 3? Because there’s a “secret” sale going on.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.820
I’ll fill you in.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.120
If you buy 3 shirts and type in one of the coupons, you’ll get $15 off your order.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.780
That’s like, 3 shirts for $30.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.480
Here’s the codes:

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.960
tenbucks20, tenbucks45, tenbucks87, tenbucks34, tenbucks85

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:18.440
Anyway, here’s the shirts I got (so don’t get em, or there could be a chance that we’d wear the same shirt on the same day, and that would be embarassing. Unless you don’t live near me or ever come in contact with me. Then it’s ok):

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.800
Nerd Berd

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.260
Nerd Berd has a nerdy bird and a cool pattern on it.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.040
I’m a nerd, so naturally I like Nerd Berd.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.820
It’s also pretty cute.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.200
My favorite color is green, so it’s also a plus that the shirt’s main color is green.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.640
The only nerdier shirt I can think of would be one that had binary on it.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.700
Oh wait, I already have shirts with binary on them…

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.820
What else can I say?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.680
I like the Nerd Berd, and hopefully it will like me back.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.280
Human Concept

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.220
I’m not really sure I know what the meaning of Human Concept is.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.760
What I do know, however, is that elephant looks way cool!

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.780
And it’s crossing the street!

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.280
At an elephant crossing!

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.920
This elephant is majorly detailed.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.020
It reminds me of one of the animals that O’ Reilly (not Bill O’ Rielly!) uses for their books.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.960
It’s in Khaki, which means it will go great with my… blue jeans!

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.080
Predicament

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.780
Predicament is a shirt with a guy fishing on a giant fish!

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.120
I guess his predicament is what he does after he catches the fish.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.860
It looks like the fish has already caught him!

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.680
This shirt must take place in Soviet Russia!

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.680
I picked this shirt because it looks cool.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.500
I mean, why else would I pick a shirt, right?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.360
I’d prefer it in a different color, but blue works.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.940
The sky is blue, and so is water.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.360
And there’s both sky and water in this shirt!

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.920
Looking at these purchases, it seems there’s pattern.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.820
Yep, all these shirts have animals on em.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.360
I don’t think I planned this when I bought em, it just happened that way.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.660
Or maybe I just prefer animals on my shirts rather than precocious artist trash!

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.800
Whoa, I think I need some sleep now. Good night.
