New Journal!

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.340
Published on October 14, 2005.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.100
So I have a livejournal now.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.920
After having a ujournal and a xanga, and cocurrently writing on myspace.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.780
I’ll try and see if I can import my old old posts into this journal.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.920
I’ll also see if I should mirror this on myspace.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.900
I’d really like a concrete blogspace, but different people read stuff in different places, so that’s probably not possible.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.480
Anyway, onto the posts!
