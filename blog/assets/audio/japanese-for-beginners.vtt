I was at thinkgeek.com for some random reason, and I saw this shirt called “ Japanese for Beginners .”

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.280
I figured it would be wacky rather than informative, and I was right!

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.260
I think this is a Jlist shirt that’s actually sold on thinkgeek, but whatever.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240
I want it for its sheer power of nerditude!
