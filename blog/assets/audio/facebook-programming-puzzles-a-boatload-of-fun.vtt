Facebook Programming Puzzles – A Boatload of Fun?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.340
Published on March 30, 2007.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.380
So I was browsing Facebook, my second favorite social network (my most favorite being Notecentric , of course).

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.920
Unbeknownst to most, Facebook has a bunch of random pages linked to from their footer.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.620
There’s a pretty cool developer blog, and other random junk.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.520
I was looking at the jobs section (I need something to do this Summer) and I came across a section called “ Puzzles .”

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.920
There’s just a bunch of programming puzzles.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.100
Some are harder than others.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.560
As in programming wise and computationally too.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.980
The Prime Bits problem seemed pretty easy (as in, doable in about an hour) so I did it.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.880
I guess I’ll just send it to Facebook and tell them that I’m looking for a Summer internship or something.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.000
The only thing is, it seems like the puzzle is too easy.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.980
What if they use this puzzle as some kind of red herring to capture lazy programmers in order to blacklist them?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.760
Or maybe there’s a way to be clever that I didn’t think of?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.940
I’ll probably send it anyway.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.280
It only took me like an hour.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.660
It’s probably mostly just to see what peoples’ programming styles are like (OOP, functional, etc.).

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.580
What’s the point of my post?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.720
I dunno, but Facebook seems like a pretty fun place to work for if they just randomly post programming puzzles for people to solve.
