My weight loss is still going pretty well with Wii Fit though the numbers seem to fit better to a power law than a linear function.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.120
But luckily the alpha is still pretty forgiving, so I’m still losing weight.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:29.680
Today I reached a sort of achievement (personal, not xbox live style) by doing the 10 reps of push-ups and side plank without collapsing or “dropping my hips” as my trainer likes to say.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.100
Although she asked even though I didn’t.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.240
Oh well. At least I know I accomplished this task.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.480
Also, the lunges are freakin’ hard.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.220
I wonder if I’m doing them correctly.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:51.720
They make the leg that I step back with feel like they’re going to explode around the 9th or so rep. Lunges are probably the only exercise that hasn’t gotten easier since starting Wii Fit.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.500
I wonder why…
