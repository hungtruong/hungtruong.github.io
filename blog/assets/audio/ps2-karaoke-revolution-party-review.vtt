PS2 – Karaoke Revolution Party Review

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.140
Published on February 19, 2007.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.020
I got Karaoke Revolution Party in December for around $10 at Toys R Us.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.280
It was a pretty sweet deal.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.020
I already had a microphone from Socom, so I figured I wouldn’t need an extra mic.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.320
Luckily it worked.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.760
So the basic premise of Karaoke Revolution is that you sing songs, and you get more points if you sing in tune with the correct vocals.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.580
There are note “tubes” that show up indicating whether you’re singing too low or high.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.960
It’s not quite like reading music or anything, but I guess it’s pretty good for public use.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.560
I really like the idea of playing a game with only your voice.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.900
It’s a pretty interesting idea and I’m kind of mad that I waited so long to finally buy a Karaoke Revolution game.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.400
I sort of secretly wanted to buy it ever since seeing these guys playing it.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.240
The gameplay isn’t perfect, though.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:07.180
It seems like the game has an easier time recognizing pitch in higher octaves, so if you’re a guy, you already have a disadvantage to the girls.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280
Also, the game is really strict in telling you exactly how to sing a song.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.340
So when I add some “soul” it ends up costing me points.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.240
Boo! It’d be pretty sweet if the game could detect freestyling and reward players for doing it well.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980
I guess that would be pretty hard though.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.300
The song selection is varied.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.000
There’s a lot of songs from the 80s up to current popular songs.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.540
They even have Neil Diamond, which my brother was happy about.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.960
I think most people will find at least one song they’d be interesting in singing, if they’re interested in singing a song to begin with.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.960
Overall, Karaoke Revolution Party is a pretty cool party game.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.020
I wish I had bought two mics so I could test out the versus and duet modes.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.920
I think there’s some duets… Maybe I’ll buy the new American Idol version .
