Google Reader and Skating to Where The Puck Used To Be

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:06.934
Published on March 15, 2013.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:11.770
I just wrote a couple of tweets about this, but maybe this is a better blog post subject.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:19.642
Google Reader is shutting down, apparently because its user base is shrinking and Google wants to focus on fewer products.

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:25.496
Because of the huge void this will leave, many startups are rushing to fill the space that Google Reader took up.

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:33.189
So far I’ve heard of plans from Digg, Flipboard, Zite (whatever that is), Feedly, and maybe some others.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:39.543
While this might be a good opportunity for those startups, it strikes me as odd.

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:46.436
There’s a concept called being a “fast follower” where you copy some innovative company’s product immediately after they release it.

00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:49.812
Think of Facebook’s clone of that Snapchat app.

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:53.589
What we’re seeing now is sort of the “slow(est) follow.”

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:03.539
I suppose it makes sense to go into a space that you know is going to swell up with demand, but honestly, how much longer does the classic Google Reader style app have left?

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.635
How much of the original Google Reader market are you going to get?

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:12.211
Will you be able to re-create the community that the sharebros loved so much?

00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:17.266
On top of that, do any of these new products have a solid plan on monetization?

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:28.495
To put it another way, what is the opportunity cost of rebuilding Google Reader (even if it’s a “reimagined” version) versus putting time into another product that might actually be new and useful?

00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:33.550
At this point, it’s probably not worth it considering how many others are eager to clone Reader.
