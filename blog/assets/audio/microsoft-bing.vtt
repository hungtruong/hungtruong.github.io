00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.518
Microsoft Bing

00:00:03.018 --> 00:00:05.575
Published on June 01, 2009.

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:10.811
So today, Microsoft unleashed its new search engine, Bing .

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:15.146
Apparently it was gonna be called “Kumo” before that (which I liked more).

00:00:15.646 --> 00:00:19.242
Live.com just redirects to Bing now.

00:00:19.742 --> 00:00:23.338
First thought: Thanks for wasting the four letter URL namespace, Microsoft!

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:29.692
Second thought: Bing.com basically looks like a re-named Live Search.

00:00:30.192 --> 00:00:34.348
People were talking about the mouse-over video search results starting automagically.

00:00:34.848 --> 00:00:39.642
I thought I saw that feature at the Microsoft booth at SXSW a few months ago.

00:00:40.142 --> 00:00:47.734
While I’m not totally familiar with the original features of Live Search, it really seems like this is just an incremental update, if not just a renaming.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:52.410
Giving the search engine a fair chance, I guess it’s okay.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.308
The search results for my name are good!

00:00:55.808 --> 00:00:59.324
First one is my blog and the second one is my portfolio.

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:07.176
Microsoft also recognizes my Facebook profile as the real Hung Truong instead of that other car Hung Truong that Google links to.

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:13.429
Another thing that’s kind of nice is that Bing actually links to the website directly in the search results.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.964
Try right click copying a search result link in Google and you get something like this:

00:01:19.964 --> 00:02:01.756
http://www.google.com/url? sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hung-truong.com%2F&ei=1ZMkSv3gDonUNNfQvYYF&rct=j&q=hung+truong&usg=AFQjCNGifmoNxXdlqaiytpE2QMgHxLkl6A&sig2=Uj7WesESTLWJEXHkfqK2Fw

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.833
The same thing in Bing is just:

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:09.429
http://hung-truong.com/

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.144
One more funny thing is that Bing is soooooo biased towards Microsoft, and you can tell already.

00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:20.199
Type the letter ‘w’ into Bing and the 7th auto-suggestion is “Windows Vista.”

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.816
Google comes up with nothing MS related.

00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:27.672
The now famous example is that if you type “linux” you’ll get

00:02:28.672 --> 00:02:29.631
linux windows

00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.989
linux microsoft

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:33.948
linux vista

00:02:34.948 --> 00:02:39.743
WTF!? Despite the wonkiness, I hope Bing does well.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:43.359
Because someone ’s gotta kick Google’s ass for the sake of competition.

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.453
While I’d rather see it from an independent player, someone’s really gotta step up search and make it better.

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:53.949
Actually, Yahoo is doing some neat stuff with semantic web thingies.

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.645
Maybe MS and Yahoo can double-team Google or something.
