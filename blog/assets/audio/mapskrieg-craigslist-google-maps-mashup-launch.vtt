MapsKrieg – Craigslist + Google Maps Mashup Launch!

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.740
Published on May 06, 2007.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:16.500
I did a bit more work on MapsKrieg (the official name of my craigslist and google maps mashup) in the past few days, and I think it’s ready for initial launch now.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:26.540
If you haven’t read my previous posts on MapsKrieg, it’s a mashup that scrapes craigslist apartment listings and displays them using the Google Maps API.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.320
I’ve been on the hunt for an apartment in Ann Arbor, MI where I’m going to go to grad school.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.740
I had seen the coolness of HousingMaps , but I noticed that it only supported a very small number of cities.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.160
I figured I’d build a similar app that listed more cities, since craigslist has expanded quite a bit since that HousingMaps was created.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.520
If you’re wondering about the name, here’s my thought process: I was originally calling the project “Craigsmaps” since that sort of made sense.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.220
But the domain name for that name is already taken.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.640
So I came up with a bunch of other stupid Web 2.0 names that didn’t really click (Abodr, apartment.icio.us (okay, just kidding)).

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.540
So I switched the “craig” and the “maps” and it became “mapscraig” which reminded me of “blitzkrieg” which became “mapskrieg.”

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.240
And there you have it.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.880
Currently MapsKrieg supports 286 different craigslist locations.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.180
I haven’t added any areas outside the United States, though if I get requests, I’ll add them.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.480
And I’ll probably add new cities as their added to craigslist if people request them, too.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:43.000
As far as technical stuff goes, I built the site on the CakePHP framework, which was a new experience for me since I had been doing stuff in Ruby on Rails for the past year.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.180
The app uses Google Maps’ API for displaying the data that’s pulled directly from craigslist listings.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.120
Of course, all the data is cached in a MySQL database, so the site is decently fast.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.720
MapsKrieg took about two “man weeks” worth of time to complete.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.340
It was developed over about a month, though I didn’t work on it every day, and I didn’t work all day on the days I did work on it.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.200
I’d say that’s pretty good, considering I hadn’t really done much programming in PHP/Javascript before, and I had to learn the Google Maps API (which was surprisingly easy).

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.640
Anyway, go ahead and try out MapsKrieg and let me know what you think.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.100
The interface could probably use some tweaking, but I think the app “works” fairly well.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.000
But I’m open to any questions or comments.
