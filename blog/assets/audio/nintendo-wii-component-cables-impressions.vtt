Nintendo Wii Component Cables: Impressions

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.140
Published on February 01, 2007.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.380
After getting my Wii, I immediately noticed that the cables that came with it were only the normal RCA crap ones.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.480
I have an HD capable TV, so I was pretty peeved.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.220
I went to Play-Asia.com and ordered the cheapest component cables .

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.280
I ordered ‘em on the 23rd and they came on the 31st, so it took about a week.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.200
So far, I’m fairly impressed.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.620
After switching the Wii from 480i to 480p, the difference is pretty noticeable.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.400
Before, I could see the picture getting blurry where the cursor was moving.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.180
It was kinda weird.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.560
With the component cables, that doesn’t happen anymore.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.120
I tried playing Zelda: Twilight Princess.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.020
There’s a huge difference with the cables.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.720
Before it was super blurry, and now it’s somewhat jaggy.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.220
Sure, the antialiasing could use work, but it still looks 100% better.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.540
If you have a Wii and a TV that takes component input, you MUST get cables.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.480
These ones were like $13, shipping included.
