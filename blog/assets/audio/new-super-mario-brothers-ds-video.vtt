New Super Mario Brothers DS Video!

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.740
Published on February 11, 2006.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.260
I found this on Boing Boing.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.520
It’s a “leaked” video of the New Super Mario Brothers game for the DS.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.960
Looks like the level is a combination of the desert level from Mario 2 (complete with quicksand) and has those platforms from the original Mario Bros.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.740
Too bad Mario gets hit right after he gets the flower.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.800
I wanted to see him spit fire!

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.340
Damn that annoying Lakitu bastard!

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.660
Another thing: When Mario gets turned into little Mario and picks up the fire flower for the first time, guess what happens?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.520
Nope, he doesn’t turn into big Mario (that’s what would’ve happened in the original Super Mario Bros.), he turns into fire Mario!

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.620
Yes, the greatest wish of my 9 year old self has come true!

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.640
Damn, I’m a nerd!
