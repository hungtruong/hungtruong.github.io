The Accidental Asian: Notes of a Native Speaker – Book Review

00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:08.292
Published on February 07, 2010.

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:17.923
As a first (or second, however you may define it) Asian American, I have often pondered about race, heritage and what it means to be an Asian Born in America.

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:19.462
I’m an ABC.

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:27.954
Eric Liu’s The Accidental Asian: Notes of a Native Speaker is a collection of essays about the Asian American condition on a number of subjects and contexts.

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.830
Eric Liu and I share a few things in common.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.045
We’re “Asians” living in America who have been well-assimilated into society.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:46.256
I found Eric’s experiences as he describes them to be very similar to my own: his parents learned English well enough so that he could learn it as his primary language.

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:51.391
His parents encouraged him to be studious but didn’t push in any particular direction.

00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:56.685
He had to learn how to fit into American society, but it seems he had a head start.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:03.419
He feels that he has lost a lot of his ancestral culture, and possibly made up for it by absorbing the local culture.

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:06.476
In many ways, I feel like I can relate with him.

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:16.586
Liu’s essays range from the state of the Asian American as the “new Jews” to the idea of Chinatown as a place/symbol to how he himself assimilated into American culture.

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:25.957
While some are very relevant today, I felt as though he used a few too many dated references, especially to the Clinton Administration “ Chinagate ” scandal.

00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:29.334
I was 13 at the time, for crying out loud!

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:37.026
The interesting ideas were about old Asian ways versus Asian American ways and the American perception of Asian Americans.

00:01:37.526 --> 00:01:41.282
Since Asians were good at math, Liu studied English.

00:01:41.782 --> 00:01:48.574
Liu seemed to do things to fight the stereotype, but in doing so he reinforced that the stereotypes actually mattered.

00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:53.010
I personally feel as though I am an American, first and foremost.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.785
I am obviously Chinese (though my name is Vietnamese), but that doesn’t define everything I am.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:03.200
This is especially true because I was born in the United States.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.333
While I have Asian friends, I also have many White friends, and those are the people who I had identified with when I was a kid.

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:15.068
I don’t think I even had a grasp of what being Asian versus White was as a young kid.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:23.480
In high school I remember seeing cliques of Asian kids, the ones who were either ESL or less proficient in English than in their parent’s language.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:35.009
On one hand I felt that it was nice that they had their groups to feel a part of (better than being alone), yet on the other hand I felt bad that they were pretty much segregated from the rest of the school and the other students.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.904
I guess on some level, though, all cliques had the same properties.

00:02:40.404 --> 00:02:44.000
I sometimes felt strange walking past the Asian kid cliques.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.178
“Do they feel like I’m a traitor?”

00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:47.717
I used to think.

00:02:48.217 --> 00:02:51.093
So goes the life of an assimilated Asian.

00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:58.646
In one essay, Liu points out that while Asian Americans are thought of as the “model minority” today, it wasn’t always so.

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:04.980
There’s the whole Chinese being kicked out of Seattle thing, and the Japanese being forced into internment camps.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.555
He pondered something that I also pondered directly after 9/11.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:15.250
If an Asian country were to go to war with the United States, what would it mean to Asian Americans living here?

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.342
I would like to think that everything would be fine, but Liu points out that we’re still not quite as assimilated in American culture as, say, Jewish people.

00:03:23.842 --> 00:03:33.272
Liu calls Asian Americans the “new Jew” because apparently we are described in the same way as Jewish people were 50 years ago: studious, unimaginative, etc.

00:03:33.772 --> 00:03:36.569
Maybe that explains why I have so many Jewish friends.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:47.298
Even so, I tend to disagree with Liu a bit on this point since another of his main points brings this link down: Asian Americans are really an amalgamation of a demographic.

00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:57.089
Within Asian Americans you have Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, Taiwanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans etc.

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.385
Are we all expected to act as one sub-minority?

00:04:00.885 --> 00:04:02.723
Does that really make sense?

00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:07.059
Isn’t it bad enough that most White people can’t tell us apart?

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:17.629
One of more interesting points that Liu brings up is that is is yet to be seen how the “Asian American” will organize and identify as a national group, or if it even will.

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:24.942
I think I started reading The Accidental Asian because I wanted to gain a little more perspective on the Asian American condition.

00:04:25.442 --> 00:04:27.759
It’s something that I usually just ignore.

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:34.412
Of course I acknowledge that I’m Asian, but I also realize that among being an Asian American, I am many things.

00:04:34.912 --> 00:04:36.431
I am a Computer Scientist.

00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.168
I am a Information Scientist.

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:40.467
I am an engineer.

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:42.086
I am a tinkerer.

00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:45.782
Maybe I’m too young to really concern myself with race issues.

00:04:46.282 --> 00:04:51.157
Or maybe it’s the fact that being Asian American has never gotten in my way when I wanted to achieve something.

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:53.095
Perhaps it’s even helped.

00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:57.990
Without conflict, I think people tend to focus on other aspects of their lives.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.326
This may be why Eric Liu’s observations all seem a bit trivial.

00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:07.621
He grew up fairly privileged, attended school at Yale and then went on to be a speechwriter for Clinton.

00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:11.637
There was no real mention of adversity in his essays.

00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:17.571
Out of the book, I think the worst thing to happen to him was his Asian hair (I can relate).

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:24.005
Overall, I think The Accidental Asian is a good read for anyone interested in Asian American issues.

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:30.099
Though it is a bit dated, I feel there are enough universal themes for it to still be relevant.

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:41.388
I would have preferred a bit more analysis on things like gender issues (Asian male stereotypes and Asian female stereotypes) and how they play into how we see our roles as Asian Americans.

00:05:41.888 --> 00:05:49.560
As a final note, Eric Liu married a White woman, but his book actually contains less tips on dating white women than this book .

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.455
Unfortunately, I will need to seek another guide to get more information on the topic.
