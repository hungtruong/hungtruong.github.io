Craigslist and Google Maps Mashup Thingy: Day 12+13 – Dot Com and Cities

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.180
Published on May 01, 2007.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.500
So I worked on the mashup quite a bit yesterday.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.320
So much that when I was done, I was too tired to write a blog entry about it.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.620
I mostly spent yesterday buying the domain name, upgrading my server, and getting the project to work on my “production” server.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.680
It wasn’t too difficult; I just needed to move the database, change some names, and make sure there weren’t any old names being used.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.180
I also started adding all of the cities on CraigsList to the database.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.280
At least, the US ones.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.440
This took a lot of time to do manually.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.260
I had to figure out if the area was an actual city, or a bunch of cities, then figure out the geo coordinates, and stuff it into the database.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.680
I thought it might be faster to do it by hand than write a script. Nope.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:02.320
Today I wrote a script that would make the entry faster by automagically getting the coordinates from Google Maps’ http request service.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.740
It still took a while, but today I finished inserting almost all of the US cities (excluding the combination ones, since Google can’t do those).

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:22.140
Now all that’s left is for me to make the pop up windows a little prettier, and maybe add a list of the CraigsList listings to the side for easy browsing by price, # of bedrooms, etc.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.320
That shouldn’t take too long.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.260
Then I can launch the site!
