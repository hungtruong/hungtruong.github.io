Whoa! I just read about this from Google Blogoscoped .

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.560
Apparently Gmail is sponsoring a Threadless t-shirt contest .

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.780
Threadless usually has cool entities like bands sponsor their contests.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.040
This is the first time I’ve heard of a web company, let alone Google do one!

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.700
I should try and enter a submission.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.160
I think the geek points for winning the Gmail Loves Threadless might be somewhere in the infinite range…
