So why am I writing anything? Because there’s songs along with the shirts! Yeah, that’s right! Every new shirt (but one) has a short song composed about that shirt on the shirt’s page. Pretty weird and cool at the same time.</p>

<p>I like “Why Did The Chicken Cross Abbey Road…?” and that’s about it. It’s a cute shirt, but I won’t buy it for $15. Perhaps if <a href="http://threadless.com/mp3s/whydidthechicken.mp3">the song</a> was more catchy… Maybe next week they’ll have better shirts (and songs)… <br clear="left" /></p>

        <p><p>It’s the 1st Annual Soundpack Syrup Chugging Contest! Inspired by the Hollywood blockbuster hit, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/B00005JKMN&amp;tag=hungtruong-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Super Troopers</a>“, this year’s event pitted Eric Oliver (on the left) versus Jordan Sayre (on the right).</p>

<p>The competition seemed to be evenly matched at first. Both men had finished about 10% of their bottles, respectively. Then something incredible happened. Jordan Sayre pulled ahead with a strategy known as “squeezing the bottle.” He won by quite a large margin.</p>

<p>As a finishing taunt, Jordan said to Eric, “finish up!” Eric reluctantly finished his bottle as the loser of the competition.</p>

<p>The second annual Soundpack Syrup Chugging Contest is currently being planned for the Spring of 2007 in sunny Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>

<p>Note: Do not try this at home. All parties involved in the chugging contest eventually barfed all the syrup (and their dinner) after the competition was over. It was gross.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2006/04/06/my-american-idol-audition-experience/">My American Idol Audition Experience!</a></h3>
        <p><center>

</center>

<p>So I had this weird dream last night that I was auditioning for American Idol. I haven’t been watching the show this season, but I guess that it somehow seeped its way into my subconscious mind (actually, I think it’s probably because my friend Mark asked me if I was watching it).</p>

<p>I was in a group of about 30 or so people auditioning. First, we took a tour of the American Idol facilities (which I don’t really think exist). They mainly consisted of empty rooms and hallways. It was sort of like a cross between Costco and a warehouse.</p>

<p>After the tour, they split up the guys and the girls (just like in the show!) and the girls auditioned first. They all went into the audition room together. Whenever a girl would walk out of the room, you could hear music (it was sort of like a rock concert in there). The guys’ turn came up, but unlike the girls, we had to go one by one.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I realized I was auditioning for American Idol, and should probably figure out what I was going to sing. I wasn’t really thinking about it before. As my turn grew nearer and nearer, the only song I could think to sing was “Isn’t She Lovely?” by Stevie Wonder, but I didn’t want to do that because everyone sings that! Plus I only know the first 6 words… I was also thinking of singing a weird Of Montreal song that would totally confuse the judges.</p>

<p>My friends started calling me on my cell phone, and I was like, “not now, I have figure out what I’m gonna sing for my American Idol audition!” They were excited, but I think they still just wanted to talk about their own stuff.</p>

<p>Next thing I know, I’m at home reading my email, and my friend sends me a message saying that he saw my audition on American Idol. This is in the strange chronology of my narrative dream. I don’t remember actually auditioning, but I guess I did… Anyway, there’s a link in the email to the video clip! Before I got a chance to click on it to watch myself audition (for the first time), I woke up. I guess I’ll never know whether I made it or not…</p>

        <p><p>Yep, I found one in my Japanese listening homework today. The lady says:</p>

<p>自分にしか責任を負ってこなかったの (eh? Jibun ni shika kattekonakatta no?)</p>

<p>Which I think means: “Eh? You only bought it for yourself?” (the subject was gifts)</p>

<p>Not only is this hard to say, but the Japanese person saying it just blazes through it! And I had to figure it out from listening, not from reading it! Listen for yourself:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/jibunnishikakattekonakattano.mp3">jibunnishikakattekonakattano.mp3</a>{#p232}</p>

<p>I guess it’s harder to understand if you’re doing listening homework, and you don’t know the Japanese that she’s saying. I’m going to go ahead and say it’s my new favorite Japanese tounge twister! Next to basugasubakuhatsu, of course…</p>

<p>MIT Nerds are developing a device that can sense the emotions of those around you and detect whether or not you’re annoying them/being boring. Via the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025456.500-device-warns-you-if-youre-boring-or-irritating.html">news link</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It will alert its autistic user if the person they are talking to starts showing signs of getting bored or annoyed…</p>

  <p>If the wearer seems to be failing to engage the person listening, the computer vibrates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, it’s for autistic people, but I wouldn’t mind having one. I could set it onto ‘reverse.’ If anyone around me was boring or annoying, it would instantly administer a Danza Slap to the offending noob.</p>

<p>For situations where slapping people myself would be inappropriate (mostly anywhere), this would be a godsend. I’d probably have to change the batteries pretty often, though…</p>
