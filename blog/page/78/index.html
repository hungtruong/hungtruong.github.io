<p>I’ve never bought anything using Wii Points before since I don’t really like the idea of micro payments. I mean, Nintendo should give us free NES games just for having a Wii, right? Anyway, when I was on the Wii Store channel today, I noticed that Punch Out was on the VC!</p>

<p>Punch Out is one of those games that I can still enjoy playing, even after like 20 years! I can’t believe it’s that old! I can’t believe I’m that old! Anyway, I used my credit card to buy some Wii Points and downloaded Punch Out! This is the version with Mr Dream, not Mike Tyson… Speaking of changes, I was on Wikipedia like last week looking at Punch Out stuff (totally unrelated). Apparently “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Punch-Out%21%21_boxers#Soda_Popinski">Soda Popinski</a>” used to be called “Vodka Drunkenski” in the arcade version. How awesome is that!?</p>

<p>I got to Bald Bull before I actually lost. That dude is a bitch. I remembered how to defeat his bull charge, but let’s just say I was a little rusty. I finally beat him, but then I couldn’t beat Piston Honda in the next league or whatever. I’ll try again later. I remember that when I was a kid, that was also the part I gave up. I guess some things don’t change…</p>

<p>Also, the new Wiimote isn’t the best controller to play Punch Out on, but it sure as hell beats the original NES controller. I like to call that old controller “The Blister Machine!” Seriously, it hurt.</p>

<p>I hope they release Super Punch Out for the SNES for the virtual console soon. That game was really awesome, too. Back in the days where all SNES games were prefixed with the word “Super!”</p>

<p>I have a Myspace account, mainly to keep in touch with people who don’t have Facebook accounts. It’s sort of like making a deal with the devil, but hey, people use it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was reading some stupid “bulletin” that one of my “friends” posted. It was just some lame spam. Then I noticed that Myspace actually does keep the user in mind in some cases. See the above screencap? Whoa, there’s a “Delete From Friends” button! Genius. It saved me like 10 clicks to do it the hard way. Sorry Slevin, it’s time we went our separate ways.</p>

<p>Maybe this means that Myspace really isn’t all about the $$$. Okay, probably not.</p>

        <p><p>Today I did a bunch of CSS, making the mashup thing actually look kind of nice. Later, I may add some more “Web 2.0” features such as drop shadows and gradients. I was having a hard time getting the map to show up in the div with a few of the css layouts I downloaded, so I just decided to code it by hand. I think it looks pretty neat; the map stretches across the whole screen and then the other content is shown in absolutely positioned divs.</p>

<p>I also did some stuff with the CakePHP helpers. CakePHP’s inferiority to Rails is really starting to show to me. I think it’s all a product of PHP having not been created for this kind of MVC design. CakePHP tries to follow the conventions of Rails, but it does so in a sort of copycat manner. As such, the result does not meet or exceed the original.</p>

<p>In the case of Helpers, Rails automagically links the named helper to the controller. In CakePHP, you must specify that a certain controller uses a certain helper. It’s kind of annoying. There also isn’t any support for the Rails convention of “partials,” which is why I’m using their helpers to begin with… It’s annoying.</p>

<p>Also, I find it annoying that CakePHP finds an objects associated objects by default when using “find()” or “findAll().” It’s useful when I want it, but when I don’t, it wastes a lot of memory! Now that I think of it, I’m not sure if Rails does this by default or not. The only reason I mention it is because I kept getting out of memory errors (or more accurately, memory limit errors) with my application. It’s a big waste when all I want is the name of the area and CakePHP fetches ALL of the associated listings for that area…</p>

<p>I must sound really whiny right now. I guess it’s just from some frustration in learning a new language/framework instead of using one that I’m used to. It’s good for me, I won’t argue against that. It’s just a bit disappointing to see all of these flaws when a framework is purported to be things like “stable” and “good.”</p>

<p>Oh, and also, I should say that I think my actual mashup is coming along pretty nicely. It should be ready in a few more “days,” where a “day” is one I am actively working on the mashup. I could probably “release” it pretty soon, but usually when I release something, it means I won’t work on it much anymore, moving to something else I find interesting. So I should probably actually have it done before I release it…</p>

<p>For some reason or other, today I was inspired to check out <a href="http://www.areasofmyexpertise.com/">The Areas of My Expertise</a> again, and I remembered that besides John Hodgman, there’s another John on that CD: Jonathan Coulton. He’s the musical guy behind the theme song for the audiobook, which I wish was available in a higher quality recording.</p>

<p>Previously, I had heard him do a cover of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509140853/http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songdetails/Baby%20Got%20Back">Baby Got Back</a> in acoustic guitar, but I didn’t realize it was him. Only when I went to his website, which has a bunch of MP3s, did I make the connection. He also has a bunch of other really neat songs, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070228130226/http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songdetails/SkyMall">Skymall</a>, which is about those catalogs you find in the airplane seats that feature <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/09/26">gigantic crossword puzzles</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070302095230/http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songdetails/Ikea">Ikea</a>, which is about the bitchin’ furniture store that my entire family loves. I read somewhere that Sweden trusts Ikea more than their own government. Which means that either Ikea is awesome, or the Swedish government is horrible.</p>

<p>The coolest song I found so far (I haven’t listened to all of the MP3s yet) is a mashup of “25 or 6 to 4”, and “When I’m 64.” The vocals of the latter spliced with the background of the former makes for a really cool, melancholy sound. I like it a lot. Check it out:</p>

        <p><p>I spent a whole lotta time today trying to get caching working with CakePHP. Apparently, CakePHP doesn’t do caching quite as gracefully as Rails when it comes to custom routing, especially in the application root. Yeah, there’s a bug. I thought I was doing something wrong though, so it took me forever to find out it was actually a bug (or is it a “feature?”).</p>

<p>Besides that, I got the interface to what it was previously, except with AJAX so that the Craigslist images are only downloaded when you click on a map marker. I also found that it takes a long time to put a week’s worth of listings (from Ann Arbor, at least) onto the map at once. I’m guessing there were at least 400 on there. I made a hard limit to the number of listings that show up, and it loads a lot faster now.</p>

<p>I’m sort of back into the mood for working on this project again. I finally beat the Scrin campaign (it was really short) in Command and Conquer 3, so I’ll definitely be more focused now. I think.</p>
