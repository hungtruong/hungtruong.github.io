        <p><figure id="attachment_2624" style="max-width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mashe.jpeg" rel="lightbox[2623]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mashe.jpeg?resize=500%2C332" alt="" title="masher" width="500" height="332" class="size-medium wp-image-2624" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mashe.jpeg?resize=500%2C332 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mashe.jpeg?resize=451%2C300 451w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mashe.jpeg?w=640 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Some rights reserved by Adam Mulligan</figcaption></figure>

<p>I checked SXSW today and noticed that the deadline for panel proposals is tonight. I originally wasn’t going to post anything, but I sat and thought for a bit about things I know enough about to propose/speak about at a conference. I remembered the whole craigslist incident and thought it would be interesting to propose a panel discussion about the state of mashups today.<figure id="attachment_2626" style="max-width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"></figure></p>

<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/potato.jpeg" rel="lightbox[2623]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/potato.jpeg?resize=500%2C334" alt="" title="potato" width="500" height="334" class="size-medium wp-image-2626" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/potato.jpeg?resize=500%2C334 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/potato.jpeg?resize=448%2C300 448w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/potato.jpeg?w=575 575w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some rights reserved by elana’s pantry&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p>In the past, mashups were held to a pretty high opinion. The proper mashup might be able to take two things and simplify a process to critical acclaim. I think in those days, mashups weren’t thought of as startups or businesses, just small tools that people could use. Flash forward to today and sites like Mapskrieg and Padmapper (and others like AirBnB) are being C&amp;Ded for their terms of use violations. Something happened in the startup world that made mashups into a viable threat, which the bigger players did not approve of.</p>

<p>While the term “mashup” seems a bit archaic now, I think it would be interesting to revisit that term and see what it means today. Take some pioneers of mashing up and some new startups and get them talking about stuff.<figure id="attachment_2627" style="max-width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"></figure></p>

<p>In other news, it looks like the Panel Picker requires some kind of “visual resource” like a video or slideshow or something. I don’t see how my proposal could be improved by that (it’s pretty cut and dry) so I’ll probably just link to this blog post and insert a lot of unrelated pictures of things being mashed up. CC licensed, of course.</p>

        <p><p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/logo.png" rel="lightbox[2600]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/logo.png?resize=287%2C59" alt="" title="MapsKrieg" width="287" height="59" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-554" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>As I mentioned on Twitter a while back, I got a cease and desist request from craigslist a couple of weeks ago for <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2007/05/06/mapskrieg-craigslist-google-maps-mashup-launch/">Mapskrieg</a> (my craigslist + Google Maps mashup for web and iOS). This request came at a pretty bad time (right before I was to move from Chicago to Ann Arbor). I quickly agreed to it and removed the app (I didn’t really have time or money to fight a lawsuit). I also added a passive-aggressive note on <a href="http://www.mapskrieg.com/">mapskrieg.com</a> that you can still read if you’d like. I contacted a reporter at PandoDaily since I had seen a few other tweets about C&amp;Ds from craigslist. He proceeded to write a pretty badly researched article (he originally was going to post that I made housingmaps.com) that got very little attention.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2012/06/21/pharma-hacked/">Pharma Hacked!</a></h3>
        <p><p>I noticed that the Google results for my blog have been showing ads for pharmaceuticals. I am not actively trying to sell drugs, so I figured this was a hack.</p>

<p>I ended up nuking the wp directory for this blog and re-installing plugins/images. I think the site’s clean now but it’s hard to tell since the “fetch as Googlebot” feature in Google Webmaster tools seems to show stale data. I’m not sure whether to blame Cloudflare, Google or myself.</p>

<p>Hopefully my Google results for this blog clear up in a few days or so. The weird part of the hack is that normal visitors are not affected. So the malware writers are apparently trying to sell stuff to Google. Of course, they’re just trying to raise their Google rank by inserting links and not being caught by being too obvious. But it’s interesting that the hack is transparent to normal people unless you check the Google cache.</p>

<p>Oh and sorry if you came here looking for the pharmaceuticals. You’ll just have to get them somewhere else.</p>

<p>I wrote in my <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2012/01/03/2011-a-hung-truong-year-in-review/">New Year’s Retrospective</a> that my greatest fear for 2012 was that I would not get as much done as in previous years due to working a regular job for the first time in years.</p>

<p>That concern turned out to be quite prescient as within a couple of months, things quickly changed. While I enjoyed increasing my proficiency in Django and hanging out with cool co-workers, I found that I couldn’t break into areas that I was really interested in, specifically mobile. I decided to look for a new opportunity where I could grow as a mobile developer.</p>

<p>I’m happy to announce that I’ve accepted a new gig with Canopy (whose name is going to change soon), a spinoff of a company called LanguageMate. Canopy is based in Ann Arbor and specializes in language applications for medical professionals. I’m working on a neat tool that helps nurses and doctors communicate with patients who might not speak the same language. I think it’s an interesting space and presents a lot of interesting challenges in interface design, marketing, end user support, and other aspects that revolve around mobile development.</p>

<p>I believe this will be a better fit as I’m now able to work on a startup that is investing heavily in mobile. On top of that, I think it’s great that the app actually does something meaningful. Sure, a photo sharing app might sell for a billion dollars, but has it ever saved a person’s life?</p>

<p>Right now I’m in the middle of another move. If all goes according to plan, I’ll be back in Ann Arbor (for the 4th time) on Friday. I’m looking forward to hanging out there again, spending more time with Emily, and eating at BTB every day.</p>

<p>I am really thankful for all the friends I made at Threadless, and I feel bad leaving them so soon. Having said that, I am really looking forward to making a big impact at a small startup that really needs my skills. Here’s to an interesting second half of 2012!</p>

<p>When Betsy left to work at Razorfish, I decided to commandeer her desk. It’s really nice. It has lots of natural sunlight and a good view (minus Atkins’ head). One thing I noticed right away is that a lot of people walk their dogs along the street in front of said window. Maybe it’s just the unseasonal crazy nice weather. Anyway, I decided to start a Tumblr of pictures of people walking their dogs. Why? Why not?</p>

<p>Mostly this is a way to practice my camera phone slinging skills. I’m not used to swiping up to get to the camera (it’s a new iOS 5.1 gesture)! Also, I have a theory that once something becomes sufficiently easy to do, there’s really no reason not to do it. So, while it lasts, please enjoy my photos of <a href="http://dogwalkin.tumblr.com/">people walking their dogs outside my office window</a>. Hopefully I will get a book deal soon.</p>
