        <p><p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/logo.png" rel="lightbox[2600]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/logo.png?resize=287%2C59" alt="" title="MapsKrieg" width="287" height="59" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-554" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>As I mentioned on Twitter a while back, I got a cease and desist request from craigslist a couple of weeks ago for <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2007/05/06/mapskrieg-craigslist-google-maps-mashup-launch/">Mapskrieg</a> (my craigslist + Google Maps mashup for web and iOS). This request came at a pretty bad time (right before I was to move from Chicago to Ann Arbor). I quickly agreed to it and removed the app (I didn’t really have time or money to fight a lawsuit). I also added a passive-aggressive note on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605092145/http://www.mapskrieg.com/">mapskrieg.com</a> that you can still read if you’d like. I contacted a reporter at PandoDaily since I had seen a few other tweets about C&amp;Ds from craigslist. He proceeded to write a pretty badly researched article (he originally was going to post that I made housingmaps.com) that got very little attention.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2012/06/21/pharma-hacked/">Pharma Hacked!</a></h3>
        <p><p>I noticed that the Google results for my blog have been showing ads for pharmaceuticals. I am not actively trying to sell drugs, so I figured this was a hack.</p>

<p>I ended up nuking the wp directory for this blog and re-installing plugins/images. I think the site’s clean now but it’s hard to tell since the “fetch as Googlebot” feature in Google Webmaster tools seems to show stale data. I’m not sure whether to blame Cloudflare, Google or myself.</p>

<p>Hopefully my Google results for this blog clear up in a few days or so. The weird part of the hack is that normal visitors are not affected. So the malware writers are apparently trying to sell stuff to Google. Of course, they’re just trying to raise their Google rank by inserting links and not being caught by being too obvious. But it’s interesting that the hack is transparent to normal people unless you check the Google cache.</p>

<p>Oh and sorry if you came here looking for the pharmaceuticals. You’ll just have to get them somewhere else.</p>

<p>I wrote in my <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2012/01/03/2011-a-hung-truong-year-in-review/">New Year’s Retrospective</a> that my greatest fear for 2012 was that I would not get as much done as in previous years due to working a regular job for the first time in years.</p>

<p>That concern turned out to be quite prescient as within a couple of months, things quickly changed. While I enjoyed increasing my proficiency in Django and hanging out with cool co-workers, I found that I couldn’t break into areas that I was really interested in, specifically mobile. I decided to look for a new opportunity where I could grow as a mobile developer.</p>

<p>I’m happy to announce that I’ve accepted a new gig with Canopy (whose name is going to change soon), a spinoff of a company called LanguageMate. Canopy is based in Ann Arbor and specializes in language applications for medical professionals. I’m working on a neat tool that helps nurses and doctors communicate with patients who might not speak the same language. I think it’s an interesting space and presents a lot of interesting challenges in interface design, marketing, end user support, and other aspects that revolve around mobile development.</p>

<p>I believe this will be a better fit as I’m now able to work on a startup that is investing heavily in mobile. On top of that, I think it’s great that the app actually does something meaningful. Sure, a photo sharing app might sell for a billion dollars, but has it ever saved a person’s life?</p>

<p>Right now I’m in the middle of another move. If all goes according to plan, I’ll be back in Ann Arbor (for the 4th time) on Friday. I’m looking forward to hanging out there again, spending more time with Emily, and eating at BTB every day.</p>

<p>I am really thankful for all the friends I made at Threadless, and I feel bad leaving them so soon. Having said that, I am really looking forward to making a big impact at a small startup that really needs my skills. Here’s to an interesting second half of 2012!</p>

<p>When Betsy left to work at Razorfish, I decided to commandeer her desk. It’s really nice. It has lots of natural sunlight and a good view (minus Atkins’ head). One thing I noticed right away is that a lot of people walk their dogs along the street in front of said window. Maybe it’s just the unseasonal crazy nice weather. Anyway, I decided to start a Tumblr of pictures of people walking their dogs. Why? Why not?</p>

<p>Mostly this is a way to practice my camera phone slinging skills. I’m not used to swiping up to get to the camera (it’s a new iOS 5.1 gesture)! Also, I have a theory that once something becomes sufficiently easy to do, there’s really no reason not to do it. So, while it lasts, please enjoy my photos of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130423150444/http://dogwalkin.tumblr.com/">people walking their dogs outside my office window</a>. Hopefully I will get a book deal soon.</p>

        <p><p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-13-at-6.59.28-PM.png" rel="lightbox[2559]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-13-at-6.59.28-PM.png?resize=290%2C69" alt="" title="Google Play" width="290" height="69" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2560" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>I signed up for the Google Music beta a while ago and promptly forgot about it. I was either too busy to check it out or unimpressed with the feature set. I recently took another look at it after it was renamed to “Google Play.” It’s suddenly making a bit more sense now that I’m trying it out again.</p>

<p>Google Play (I’m really just talking about the music part) lets you upload all of your music to Google’s servers. This step seems kind of dumb but I guess for legal reasons they can’t just recognize your music and use their own copies of songs. I’m sure they’ve got the technology to do it. Anyway, once your music is uploaded you can play it from “the cloud.” While this seems like something so simple that Dropbox could do it, it’s the details that matter. In this case, Google offers a pretty neat interface to listen to your music (and buy more, if desired).</p>

<p>I haven’t used iTunes Match personally, but from what I’ve read, it seems to do something similar. iTunes Match will scan your music library and “match” them up with songs in their database. If a song isn’t on your iPhone but is in your library, you can download and listen to it from your device. So far, it doesn’t seem like there’s a desktop component of iTunes Match besides iTunes (meaning you can’t listen from a website). Also, iTunes Match costs money.</p>

<p>What I like about Google Play is that there is a web interface, so I can listen to all of my music at work without having to download iTunes. I complained earlier on Twitter about how there isn’t a native app for iOS that lets you listen to your Google Play stuff, but there does happen to be a web based player that seems okay. iTunes integrates more easily with your library (no need to actually upload stuff) but seems more rigid about re-downloading music.</p>

<p>Overall, it seems like Google Play is the better service. If it had a native app for iOS it would be the clear winner. Eventually I would like to lower the amount of space on my phone that I’m using for music, which would allow me to have more apps, photos and videos. Hopefully the two services continue to develop and compete with each other to the point where they’re both improving.</p>
