        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2009/11/11/they-might-be-giants-at-sodo-showbox-seattle-wa-11102009/">They Might Be Giants at SoDo Showbox, Seattle WA 11/10/2009</a></h3>
        <p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1610" title="flood" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/flood.jpg?resize=500%2C509" alt="flood" width="500" height="509" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>So I saw They Might Be Giants in concert last night. This was a super special show where they played all of the songs from their album Flood plus some other songs as filler.</p>

<p>There was actually an opener called “Guggenheim Grotto.” Their music wasn’t too bad. But it seemed really inappropriate as an opener to TMBG. Like their songs were about love and pretty serious without any funny lyrics at all. You could kind of tell the crowd was not into them. I felt they should’ve had a more appropriate opener, but oh well. I guess there aren’t really a bunch of bands that are like TMBG and could open for them.</p>

<p>They didn’t actually go on stage til around 10pm, opening with some kind of song about elements. I haven’t listened to their kid’s albums, so this one was new to me. Then they did some other songs before launching into Flood. Along the way they also did some weird puppet show, but it seemed like they had less random stage stuff than <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2007/11/14/they-might-be-giants-concert-review/">the last concert I saw</a>, where they channeled a dead person or something.</p>

<p>For the most part they played songs from Flood in sequence, though for some reason they rearranged Racist Friend and maybe also Particle Man. I think some of the fans were like “WTF” because of that. Personally I’ve listened through Flood so many times that it seems like one giant song. So any break in the sequence is pretty noticeable.</p>

<p>While I like the concept of playing a whole album for a concert (plus other songs), in practice it seems kind of absurd. Some songs just don’t make sense live, like Hearing Aid or Minimum Wage. But in the spirit of experimentation and randomness I can accept it. While Flood is a really good album, I would’ve liked to hear more songs from other albums, too. They did play She’s An Angel, which was cool. And Famous Polka, The Mesopotamians (which I guess they use a lot as a pseudo closer), Shoehorn With Teeth and Why Does The Sun Shine? But what about Ana Ng and Don’t Let’s Start? I guess you can’t fit all their songs into one concert…</p>

<p>As with the last time I saw them (almost exactly two years ago to the date!), TMBG is really good live. Some of the Flood songs seemed a bit under-rehearsed, but besides that they were good. Linnell sang a wrong lyric in Letterbox and I think everyone noticed. Also, random thought of the concert: “Is it weird that there is a giant room of people all singing along to a song about buying prosthetic foreheads to wear on their real heads? I guess not.”</p>

<p>Also similar to last time, the band left, then came back for two or three songs, then left again. At this point I was really tired and started walking off. But then they did a second encore! That’s how you know they’re professionals. I just hope they don’t push it so much that each song requires an additional encore, starting from the first song played. That would get tiring. The last song they did was Fingertips from Apollo 18, which I think they also did the previous concert I saw. It’s a crowd-pleaser.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will get to see They Might Be Giants again some time. They really are fantastic live (especially Linnell’s piercing voice) and really fun, too.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2009/11/08/how-to-date-a-white-woman-a-practical-guide-for-asian-men/">How To Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide For Asian Men</a></h3>
        <p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0919637264?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hungtruong-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0919637264"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/How-to-date-a-white-woman.jpg?resize=297%2C475" alt="How to date a white woman" title="How to date a white woman" width="297" height="475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Every once in a while a book comes along that seems like it was written specifically for me. Actually, that never happens. But then I heard about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0919637264?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hungtruong-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0919637264">How to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide For Asian Men</a>. And that, my friends, is a book with “Hung Truong” written all over it! I first heard about it from my internet pals JP Meyer and Maria via their Google Reader shared feeds. After seeing the cover and reading the title, I knew I had to get this book. I promptly ordered the thing from a third party Amazon seller for whatever crazy high price it was. It was completely worth it.</p>

<p>I didn’t get the book to improve my white woman dating skills, but rather to try and get into the mind of an Asian guy who would write such a book (I am already dating a white woman, fairly successfully). The book is written by Adam Quan, who is apparently “an International Business Consultant” who has “successfully dated women of many nationalities.” The book has a little bit of everything, from a theory on why white guys have more luck with Asian girls versus Asian guys and white girls, to detailed statistics on divorce rates and even score sheets for keeping track of your white woman dating progress. I am not making any of this up!</p>

<p>One of the best parts of the book is the inclusion of Asian grammars. There are countless grammar and spelling mistakes sprinkled here and there. It helps to read the book in the voice of a grumpy old Asian male. Here’s an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The image you projected to the white woman is the very core of your dating strategy. To date successfully, often you must become knowledgeable about the white woman in question. Find out what ticks her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately (for anyone reading the book seriously), the advice doesn’t really seem all that helpful. The author suggests that to compensate for being tiny, Asian men should work out to increase their physical size. Another section heading is titled “Avoid Losers.” Yet the book sorta forgets to include some common knowledge about dating, like calling the girl the day after a date, etc. The process that the book suggests seems a bit too structured and analytical. I guess it could help to keep a journal, but should Asian men really be keeping track of their current “points,” gain/loss velocity and possible competition after each date!? It’s pretty apparent that a businessman wrote this.</p>

<p>Another distressing thing about the book is its fairly misogynistic tone. For one thing, it treats women as objects, often referring to them as “targets” and the reader as a “hunter.” It portrays the submissive Asian woman stereotype and flips that around to conclude that white women are focused on being headstrong individuals. This is not to say that I didn’t find the book to be extremely entertaining. But there were quite a few parts that had me scratching my head and wondering about those who would take it seriously. I kind of feel bad for the Asian guys who need this book and end up taking its advice.</p>

<p>Overall, the book is quite useless for its intended purpose. For unintentional humor, this book rates very high. If I weren’t already dating a white woman and wanted to bag one, I think it’d also be great as a prop. Just take this to the nearest Starbucks (or wherever white women gather in your area) and pretend to be studying it closely. It’ll definitely be more useful as a conversation starter than a reference book.</p>

<p>My advice: be yourself. Be genuine. Really listen. Oh, and really do work out to compensate for your wimpy Asian physique. <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/tag/wii-fit/">Wii Fit</a> seems to work well for me.</p>

        <p><p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1595" title="ingridband" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ingridband.jpg?resize=500%2C304" alt="ingridband" width="500" height="304" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ingridband.jpg?resize=500%2C304 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ingridband.jpg?resize=1024%2C623 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ingridband.jpg?w=1536 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ingridband.jpg?w=1208 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>I got to see Ingrid Michaelson in concert at <a href="http://neumos.com/">Neumos</a> in Seattle last night. I previously saw her for the first time in <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2007/12/14/ingrid-michaelson-in-ann-arbor-121207/">Ann Arbor, 2007</a>. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to see her in Ann Arbor last year because she sold out pretty quickly.</p>

<p>From what I remember of the last time I saw her (I haven’t re-read my other concert post yet), she seemed really modest and was excited that people in the audience knew the words to some of her songs. After two years of success, it seems like she’s a lot more confident, but also kind of diva-ish. Not that she’s a bitch or anything, but she’s sort of less charming in the way she was before. She still mentioned lots of random stuff like crying a bunch after watching The Family Stone on the tour bus and how much they like all like Mexican food.</p>

<p>Before Ingrid and the band came on, there was an opening act guy named Matthew Perryman Jones. I wonder if it’s his real name or a fake stage name! He was pretty good, but his songs were kind of yawn-inducing. He was nice though, and he said that all proceeds of the music and shirts and stuff would go to a child in need. Then he revealed the child in need is his child! What a joker.</p>

<p>Ingrid and the gang came on kind of late, and started with Soldier, which is the opener of her new album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M302NS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002M302NS">Everybody</a>, which I haven’t written about yet. Then she played a mix of songs from her past three albums. The first time I saw her, she only brought her friend Allie, but this time she had a full band, which is kind of necessary for playing a lot of the arrangements in the new album. The older songs felt a little weird with a full band though. To be fair, some of the arrangements were refreshing, like Far Away turned into a much richer song and I think Giving Up almost turned into a country song, which had an awesome effect. This is exactly why live performances are worthwhile to plunk down change for.</p>

<p>Ingrid said she was tired because she had taken a nap. I can relate. It’s hard to get back on track after taking an hour nap. She sounded fine, though. Her voice was as nice as I remember it. There were times that she used a little too much vibrato though. But she’s totally still got it talent-wise.</p>

<p>I think her songwriting has gotten better as well. I really like Die Alone, don’t get me wrong. But it’s just a little too repetitive. Her new songs are much better in that sense.</p>

<p>Oh, also, when she sang Can’t Help Falling in Love, some girl fainted. And she said it happened the previous night, too! Maybe it’s an epidemic. Or maybe people just know they can get Ingrid to come to their rescue and get close to her by pretending to faint during that song…</p>

<p>Overall, I think Ingrid Michaelson has improved quite a lot. The lacking maturity factor that I wrote about in my previous posts seems to have resolved itself. Maybe is a really good album. And Ingrid is a really good performer (and so are her bandmates, especially Allie). Oh, and her other girl guitar player is kind of cute. So go see her live if she hasn’t already sold out in your town! Apparently she has sold out everywhere she’s gone so far. Hopefully I will get to see Ingrid again some time soon without a skip year like before!</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2009/10/05/grocery-shopping-in-seattle/">Grocery Shopping in Seattle</a></h3>
        <p><p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pcclogo-pc-color-small.jpg?resize=192%2C144" alt="PCC Logo" title="PCC Logo" width="192" height="144" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1590" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>As some of you may know, grocery shopping is very important to me. It’s one of my favorite adult activities to partake in. Which is to say that grocery shopping is one of those things that you do after making the transition from kid to adult. Or at least that’s what I like tricking myself into believing.</p>

<p>In Michigan, I went to <a href="http://www.meijer.com/">Meijer</a>, because it pretty much had everything I needed. I’d also make a side trip to <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/">Trader Joe’s</a> maybe once a month for hippie supplies. Now, in a new city, I must figure out where to get my foods and stuffs. Meijer is strictly a Midwest chain, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Now, the obvious choice would be to pick the closest grocery. It’s pretty easy to calculate the distance to the closest grocery because I live above the <a href="http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com/locations/fr.html">PCC Food co-op thingy</a>. Literally. I am on the fifth floor and they take up the first floor in my building. I could literally jump down to the store entrance. Actually, a firefighter pole setup might be safer and cooler, but I’ll have to ask my landlord about it. The PCC is pretty high quality; it makes Trader Joe’s look like Wal-mart. But things there also cost an arm and a leg (good thing I upped my accidental death and dismemberment insurance (AD&amp;D)). So I go there for quick and inexpensive things, like bananas or other produce, or when I really need something bad (like tofu). Also, PCC doesn’t sell anything that’s not “natural,” so I can’t get goldfish crackers or Drain-o there.</p>

<p>There is a Trader Joe’s in Ballard that’s pretty nearby that I’m hitting often. I also just discovered a <a href="http://www.fredmeyer.com/Pages/default.aspx">Fred Meyer</a> (I dunno if there’s a relation to Meijer) that has a Chase bank in it (bonus points, just like my old Meijer!). The Fred Meyer is gigantic and pretty close to Wal-mart vibe. I’ve also gone to <a href="http://www.safeway.com/ifl/grocery/home">Safeway</a> for my unnatural foods. When I shop at the University Village, I can hit up the <a href="http://www.qfc.com/Pages/default.aspx">QFC</a> (which is like Kroger/Smith’s) on the way. I haven’t been to <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a> yet, but I don’t see a reason to with the Whole Foods-ish PCC taking care of my overpriced grocery needs. There’s also apparently a place in Ballard called <a href="http://tc-markets.com/tcm/default.aspx">Ballard Market</a> (appropriately) that’s supposed to be pretty decent. I’ve also gone to the Asian market, Uwajimaya, in the International District, but that’s more of a specialty case. Also, I don’t eat enough food to shop at Costco (<a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/tag/oj/">orange juice</a> excluded from this statement).</p>

<p>As you can see, I am a bit obsessive about grocery shopping. I haven’t found a store that has all the stuff I need/want in one location at the price I’d like to pay. So for now I think I’ll forage around multiple stores, which is inconvenient but somewhat necessary. Ever since I read The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I feel like I should be a bit more careful in the purchasing and preparation of my food. I don’t feel too bad spending a chunk of change on something at PCC. Unless, of course, there’s a random markup and I can get the same thing somewhere else for 40% less. Oh, and I just got a hold for In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114964?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143114964">Defense of Food</a> at the library, so hopefully that will make me a bit less picky.</p>
