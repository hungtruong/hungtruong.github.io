        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2008/07/06/the-google-shirt-of-hostility/">The Google Shirt of Hostility</a></h3>
        <p><p>So a while back <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2006/10/26/google-information-session/">I scored a free Google shirt</a> (my first of many). This was while I was at the University of New Mexico, where the school colors are “Cherry” and “Silver.” The shirt itself was red with white text. Kind of like this cup (I couldn’t find a pic of the actual shirt, and I didn’t want to take a pic of it; it’s kind of faded now):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-787 aligncenter" title="google-cup" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/google-cup.jpg?resize=430%2C430" alt="" width="430" height="430" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/google-cup.jpg?w=430 430w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/google-cup.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>Just imagine that cup in shirt form. Anyway, the shirt colors fit the UNM colors. Pretty sweet!</p>

<p>Now fast forward to… now. I’m at the University of Michigan, and our colors are “Blue” and “Maize.” Our sworn enemy, Ohio State, has the colors of “Scarlet” and “Gray.” Which is basically the same as my old school’s colors. Kind of hard to disassociate with. Anyway, I’ve noticed that while walking around with my red Google shirt on, people seem to give me more dirty looks (than usual). Like I was at Meijer last week and I could’ve sworn I noticed some hostility.</p>

<p>I figured the Google shirt (remember, imagine the cup above as a shirt) reminds them of the Ohio State shirt:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-788 aligncenter" title="ohio-state-shirt" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ohio-state-shirt.jpg?resize=475%2C600" alt="" width="475" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>That might just be my crazy theory, but I think it works. I’m sure from a far enough distance, the red Google shirt could look like the Ohio State shirt. And I’ve given my fair share of dirty looks to people wearing Ohio State stuff in Ann Arbor. How dare they, right?</p>

<p>I think it’s time I get a blue and maize Google shirt. What say you, Google?</p>

</p>

<p>I’ve been watching Flight of The Conchords due to numerous people liking them. Also, I saw them live in Ann Arbor some time in May. They’re pretty funny.</p>

<p>Anyway, most of their songs are kind of the type that wouldn’t be that great, except that they have jokes in them. Honestly, if the songs weren’t funny as well, they wouldn’t have as much sticking power, I think.</p>

<p>There’s one song that shows up later in the first season called “Ladies of The World.” I think it’s the real deal. And it’s currently stuck in my head. The way the percussion lines up with the guitar and the crazy sexy bass line? Yeah, it’s the real deal. And I guess the lyrics are pretty funny, too. And the special music video… Okay, maybe it’s just because the song is funny. I don’t know anymore!</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2008/07/01/wii-fit-anomalies-easter-eggs/">Wii Fit Anomalies! (Easter Eggs?)</a></h3>
        <p><p>So I’ve been playing Wii Fit for a while, and I’ve noticed some weird stuff happen. For example, some days I’ll just get the male trainer (I typically like the female trainer) and he’ll say something like “Hey there, I’ll be your trainer for today” but he goes away after one exercise. Also, my normal trainer will just say random stuff sometimes, like she’ll act sleepy and talk about how she didn’t get enough sleep last night. Hey trainer, let’s try to keep it professional, huh? I don’t want to know about your personal life.</p>

<p>Another random thing I noticed was that my playing time would just randomly reset sometimes. I finally figured out what was going on last night. It turns out that Wii Fit just counts the minutes you work out per day. So since I was playing late last night, the time reset. I think it would make more sense to count minutes on a per session basis, but whatever. The whole midnight cutoff thing works too, I guess.</p>

<p>Finally, I noticed that my trainer’s hairstyle changed! It’s in a short ponytail now:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-trainer.jpg" />
</p>

<p>Before it was sort of a short hairstyle. Don’t ask me why I noticed this. Let’s just say it was only about last week that I noticed she didn’t actually move her lips. I’m not usually staring at her lips… Previously I thought it would be cool if you could “dress up” your trainer. I guess that’s kind of a uniquely Japanese thing that culturally people might want to do. I guess it’s cool if the trainer just has a mind of their own as well. I think that the outfit for the female trainer might’ve gotten a bit more conservative. It looks like in the old Wii Fit commercials she’s wearing a shorter top (and showing more tummy) as seen here:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-782 aligncenter" title="wii-fit-big" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-big.jpg?resize=500%2C501" alt="" width="500" height="501" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-big.jpg?resize=500%2C501 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-big.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-big.jpg?w=798 798w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>Anyway, I should probably be paying less attention to the actual trainer and more attention to working out. Which is working pretty well for me, actually.</p>

        <p><p>My friend <a href="http://patmce.blogspot.com/">Patrick</a> sent me a link in an email about a news story. Sweet! I love seeing news about me! But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032316/http://www.click2houston.com/news/16752610/detail.html">this Hung Truong</a> was definitely not me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The suspect, Hung Truong, 24, appeared in court Monday morning on a manslaughter charge. His bond was set at $50,000. Investigators said that the charge could be upgraded to intoxication manslaughter depending on the outcome of toxicology tests. Officers at the accident scene Sunday said Truong was nonchalant and at times laughing as if he were impaired by drugs or alcohol, or had a severe mental deficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>C’mon, other Hung Truong! You’re giving Hung Truongs like me a bad name! Also, I happen to be 25 now, so there shouldn’t be any confusion as to which Hung Truong is the “bad” one!</p>

<p>Perusing Google News, I also dug up this recent story about a <a href="http://www.vaughantoday.ca/story.php?id=842">Canadian Hung Truong</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hung Truong, 39, of Markham, faces charges of arson endangering life and production of a controlled substance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously now! Aren’t there any other good Hung Truongs (besides me, of course) around to spread the good name(s) of Hung Truong!? <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2007/05/29/wsj-article-about-social-computing-me/">I got us that WSJ article</a>, but how much more can one Hung Truong do!?</p>

<p>Also, this sorta reminds me of a time way back, when a Google search for Hung Truong brought up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080315162518/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2000/09/09-18-00tdc/09-18-00dnews-2.asp">this news article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last week, women from 13 different rooms told police a stranger entered their rooms while they were asleep early Sunday morning. Six women said the man climbed on them, pulled off their clothes or fondled them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Man, I’m glad I upped my <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hung+truong&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Google PageRank</a>!</p>

<p>Anyway, for anyone checking out my blog (like, for a job or something) and wondering, “is this the Hung Truong who was arrested for X?” No. I’m the good Hung Truong! Or perhaps I doth protest too much?</p>

        <p><p>So while I was checking out IMDB and getting lost in cross-references, I came across the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0667326/">Rob Paulsen</a> guy’s filmography. Rob Paulsen is the guy who does Yakko from Animaniacs and is pretty much in anything that requires voice acting.</p>

<p>Anyway, I saw one of his recent jobs was on The Land Before Time XIII: The Wisdom of Friends. Read that again.</p>

<p>Yes. There are 13 fucking Land Before Time movies!</p>

<p>I think all of them besides the first one were direct to video affairs, but still. Gosh damn! 12 sequels! I guess they must still be profitable if they can still churn them out as much as they are.</p>
