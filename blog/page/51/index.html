</p>

<p>So after a few false starts, I have an iPhone 3G that works.</p>

<p>The journey was a long one; at the end I grew weary and lost faith. But finally, I have a neat iPhone 3G that does cool stuff.</p>

<p>It started this morning at around 5:30. I woke up (though I only got like, 3 hours of sleep since I had taken a nap earlier and messed up my sleep cycle) and took a quick shower. No breakfast. Just took a vitamin water (these things are kinda good!) and a coffee granola bar for energy.</p>

<p>Gaurav (from <a href="http://www.troubadourmobile.com/">Troubadour Mobile</a>) picked Adam (also from <a href="http://www.troubadourmobile.com/">Troubadour Mobile</a>) and I up. We drove to the mall and saw a bunch of peeps. We also saw some officemates from <a href="http://campusroost.com/">CampusRoost</a> (yes, that’s a slick mention!). They told us that the AT&amp;T store on Liberty had like, zero people and we should go there.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-792 aligncenter" title="line" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/line.jpg?resize=450%2C600" alt="" width="450" height="600" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/line.jpg?resize=450%2C600 450w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/line.jpg?w=453 453w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>When we actually got to the AT&amp;T store, it was around 6:30ish. There were actually about 30 people in line. Apparently everyone showed up around 6:15 or so. There was a really cool line wrangler named Steve that kept everyone reasonably informed. We found out there were like, 40 phones. So we should be able to get one. Adam and Brent didn’t want to settle for white ones. Or 8GB ones. But I think eventually Adam got a black 8GB and I dunno what Brent did.</p>

<p>At 8am, the line started moving, and it was moving well. But then disaster struck! It seems either Apple or AT&amp;T didn’t have the resources to take a billion people in the US all wanting iPhones at the same time (and having to activate them in the store). The activations were apparently taking around 45-50 minutes each when they should’ve taken 15 or so.</p>

<p>Eventually, the AT&amp;T people let us just do most of the steps in store and then activate at home. By the time we were done, it was about 11am. I went home and tried to activate the thing for about 15 minutes. iTunes was just being bad. So I went to sleep. I woke up at around 2pm and tried to activate again. This time it worked after about 30 minutes of trying.</p>

<p>I’ve been loading up apps and trying them out. It’s pretty cool. My favorite so far is the PhoneSaber.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2008/07/10/mega-man-9-on-wiiware-awesome/">Mega Man 9 on WiiWare. AWESOME</a></h3>
        <p><flv href="/blog/video/mm9multidebu_flvlow.flv" width="480" height="360" autostart="true" />

<p>So I read that Mega Man 9 is coming out on WiiWare. Cool. But then I realized it was Mega Man 9 and not, say, Mega Man X or Mega Man Battle Network. It’s MEGA MAN! The old school one!</p>

<p>I remember getting Mega Man 1 (still have it) for the NES after getting 3. I think the second one is probably still the best, what with Wood Man, Heat Man and Bubble Man. Geez, Bubble Man was so awesome!</p>

<p>It’s amazing that Capcom is actually making a new Mega Man game with NES style graphics. I think the only reason this is possible is that digital distribution (Wii Shop channel, PS3 Store, Xbox Live) makes it extremely cheap to distribute. I imagine an 8-bit game costs less to develop than, say, Grand Theft Auto 4. So Capcom should be able to make its money back through nostalgic fans.</p>

<p>I, for one, will probably be getting it. Depending on my level of nostalgia vs. the price of the thing. I remember the NES Mega Man series kind of jumping the shark anyway, when they started running out of “Men” to use. Seriously, Pharaoh Man? CLOWN MAN!?</p>

<p>I hope the bosses are a bit more original and kickass this time around.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2008/07/06/the-google-shirt-of-hostility/">The Google Shirt of Hostility</a></h3>
        <p><p>So a while back <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2006/10/26/google-information-session/">I scored a free Google shirt</a> (my first of many). This was while I was at the University of New Mexico, where the school colors are “Cherry” and “Silver.” The shirt itself was red with white text. Kind of like this cup (I couldn’t find a pic of the actual shirt, and I didn’t want to take a pic of it; it’s kind of faded now):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-787 aligncenter" title="google-cup" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/google-cup.jpg?resize=430%2C430" alt="" width="430" height="430" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/google-cup.jpg?w=430 430w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/google-cup.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>Just imagine that cup in shirt form. Anyway, the shirt colors fit the UNM colors. Pretty sweet!</p>

<p>Now fast forward to… now. I’m at the University of Michigan, and our colors are “Blue” and “Maize.” Our sworn enemy, Ohio State, has the colors of “Scarlet” and “Gray.” Which is basically the same as my old school’s colors. Kind of hard to disassociate with. Anyway, I’ve noticed that while walking around with my red Google shirt on, people seem to give me more dirty looks (than usual). Like I was at Meijer last week and I could’ve sworn I noticed some hostility.</p>

<p>I figured the Google shirt (remember, imagine the cup above as a shirt) reminds them of the Ohio State shirt:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-788 aligncenter" title="ohio-state-shirt" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ohio-state-shirt.jpg?resize=475%2C600" alt="" width="475" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>That might just be my crazy theory, but I think it works. I’m sure from a far enough distance, the red Google shirt could look like the Ohio State shirt. And I’ve given my fair share of dirty looks to people wearing Ohio State stuff in Ann Arbor. How dare they, right?</p>

<p>I think it’s time I get a blue and maize Google shirt. What say you, Google?</p>

</p>

<p>I’ve been watching Flight of The Conchords due to numerous people liking them. Also, I saw them live in Ann Arbor some time in May. They’re pretty funny.</p>

<p>Anyway, most of their songs are kind of the type that wouldn’t be that great, except that they have jokes in them. Honestly, if the songs weren’t funny as well, they wouldn’t have as much sticking power, I think.</p>

<p>There’s one song that shows up later in the first season called “Ladies of The World.” I think it’s the real deal. And it’s currently stuck in my head. The way the percussion lines up with the guitar and the crazy sexy bass line? Yeah, it’s the real deal. And I guess the lyrics are pretty funny, too. And the special music video… Okay, maybe it’s just because the song is funny. I don’t know anymore!</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2008/07/01/wii-fit-anomalies-easter-eggs/">Wii Fit Anomalies! (Easter Eggs?)</a></h3>
        <p><p>So I’ve been playing Wii Fit for a while, and I’ve noticed some weird stuff happen. For example, some days I’ll just get the male trainer (I typically like the female trainer) and he’ll say something like “Hey there, I’ll be your trainer for today” but he goes away after one exercise. Also, my normal trainer will just say random stuff sometimes, like she’ll act sleepy and talk about how she didn’t get enough sleep last night. Hey trainer, let’s try to keep it professional, huh? I don’t want to know about your personal life.</p>

<p>Another random thing I noticed was that my playing time would just randomly reset sometimes. I finally figured out what was going on last night. It turns out that Wii Fit just counts the minutes you work out per day. So since I was playing late last night, the time reset. I think it would make more sense to count minutes on a per session basis, but whatever. The whole midnight cutoff thing works too, I guess.</p>

<p>Finally, I noticed that my trainer’s hairstyle changed! It’s in a short ponytail now:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-781 aligncenter" title="wii-fit-trainer" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-trainer.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-trainer.jpg?resize=500%2C375 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-trainer.jpg?w=1600 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads//home/.delta/hungtruong/hung-truong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-trainer.jpg?w=1208 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>Before it was sort of a short hairstyle. Don’t ask me why I noticed this. Let’s just say it was only about last week that I noticed she didn’t actually move her lips. I’m not usually staring at her lips… Previously I thought it would be cool if you could “dress up” your trainer. I guess that’s kind of a uniquely Japanese thing that culturally people might want to do. I guess it’s cool if the trainer just has a mind of their own as well. I think that the outfit for the female trainer might’ve gotten a bit more conservative. It looks like in the old Wii Fit commercials she’s wearing a shorter top (and showing more tummy) as seen here:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-782 aligncenter" title="wii-fit-big" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-big.jpg?resize=500%2C501" alt="" width="500" height="501" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-big.jpg?resize=500%2C501 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-big.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wii-fit-big.jpg?w=798 798w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>Anyway, I should probably be paying less attention to the actual trainer and more attention to working out. Which is working pretty well for me, actually.</p>
