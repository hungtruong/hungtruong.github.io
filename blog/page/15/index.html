        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2011/01/06/impressions-of-android-from-an-iphone-userdeveloper/">Impressions of Android From an iPhone User/Developer</a></h3>
        <p><p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/android-s1-box.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="" title="android-s1-box" width="500" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2221" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>I just got an Android phone, the HTC Hero, to play around with and perhaps develop on. It was only $55 on Ebay (including shipping) which seemed like a steal to me. I’m currently using it on WiFi without any phone service (the phone has a bad ESN, so that’s probably why the price was so low).</p>

<p>My first impression as an iPhone user is that the interface is really clunky. There just isn’t as much attention payed to detail. For example, there are often measurable delays between pressing a button and seeing something happen. This happens when I try to add a widget to the home screen or open an app that hasn’t been opened into memory. If I press a button and I don’t see something <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/responsetime.html">happen immediately</a>, I will assume I missed the button and press it again. This is extremely frustrating since the iPhone animates immediately upon user interaction. The iPhone may not be any faster than my Android phone, but it at least gives the illusion of it (which is probably just as good in terms of usability).</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed is the lack of “back” buttons in the Android apps. Even Twitter lacks the onscreen back button. I assume this is following some kind of standard Android paradigm of favoring physical buttons over onscreen ones. It took me a while to get used to hitting the physical back button (and home, menu and search for that matter) instead of looking for navigation on the screen. While this is a different paradigm, I’m not sure I’m in a position to say it’s worse, better or on par with the iPhone. My suspicion is that the lack of onscreen navigation requires the user to go through more context switches (screen to physical button back to screen) which is disorienting. This is made worse by the fact that there’s seven fuckin’ buttons on my particular phone! I’m sure people adapt and get used to it, but I’m personally used to having just one button that takes me to the home screen (oh, and the volume and lock buttons, but they don’t serve dynamic functions in applications (unless they want to break the App Store terms)).</p>

<p>About the only positive thing I can say about the Android platform is that Google is integrating the shit out of it with their own services. I only have to sign in once with my Google account and I get Voice, Talk, Maps, Search, Goggles, Places, Latitude, Market, Contacts, Gmail, YouTube and probably some other things I’m forgetting. The voice commands are incredibly cool, though I wonder how many times I’d actually use them instead of doing things the normal way. Oh, another positive is that Angry Birds is free on Android, though my device is way too slow to run it.</p>

<p>I’m currently using a ROM with 2.2 on my HTC Hero, so that might account for some performance issues (though I thought it was supposed to be faster). I’m still kind of unimpressed by Android as a whole though, especially in terms of end to end usability. I originally got this device so I could test code on hardware, but I’m not so sure I even want to develop for Android anymore. I’ll probably end up writing some simple code, at least.</p>

<p>Does anyone with a newer Android phone want to debunk or argue with anything I’ve written?</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2011/01/02/prediction-for-2011-death-of-the-phone/">Prediction for 2011: Death of the Phone</a></h3>
        <p><p>It’s January, which means it’s time for really misinformed predictions that will just look silly in hindsight! I’ve been <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2009/07/16/to-google-voice-or-not-to-google-voice/">reluctant in the past to use Google Voice</a> because of integration issues, but I think 2011 is the year that I’ll start relying on it more, especially if I end up changing my real phone number (I’ll just give out my Google Voice # and forward calls).</p>

<p>I recently bought an Android phone and was thinking of what I could use it for. With Google Voice and Skype, I could make “calls” and send text messages wherever I have an internet connection. If Google eventually enables making voice calls over wifi (like in Google Chat, and I predict they will some time this year), I think the big phone companies will start hurting, because people will want data-only plans so that they can call with Google.</p>

<p>This “cable cutting” has already happened with landlines (my Mom has a dedicated phone device that does VoIP) and cable tv. So it makes sense that wireless phone providers will soon feel the effects as well. I’d really love to set up the HTC Hero that I ordered as a dedicated “landline” phone that I use with my internet connection at home.</p>

<p>Of course, most people will still probably continue to use the standard bundled minutes + texts (+ data) phone plans, but I feel early adopters are just itching to pay one monthly data bill for all of their infrastructure needs. It’ll only be a matter of time before the mainstream begins to head in that direction. I think that the phone as we know it (how ridiculous is it to pay a phone plan based on the number of minutes in the plan?) will begin to die in 2011, with more emphasis on bandwidth as the infrastructure requirement.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2010/12/31/2010-a-hung-truong-year-in-review/">2010: A Hung Truong Year In Review</a></h3>
        <p><p>Looking back at 2010, this year has been one of change and growth for me. I’d like to take a post and look back at what I did this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/01/">January</a> and <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/02/">February</a> were kinda uneventful. I was pretty nose down trying to become a good PM at Microsoft. Oh, and I was busy making troll posts about how the iPad was gonna suck and I wrote a lot of book and music reviews.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/03/">March</a>, I attended SXSW and <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/03/20/sxsw-2010-my-panel-moderator-experience/">moderated a panel</a> that I had submitted the year before on Student Startups. I met many of my friends who I hadn’t seen in a while and <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/03/17/sxsw-2010-official-celebrity-sighting-namedropping-post/">met a lot of cool new people</a>. It was from that experience that I decided I needed to stop doing what I was currently doing and change course so that I could do what I was “meant” to do. Also in March, I was rejected from the one PhD program I had applied to. In hindsight, this was probably a good thing. I’m <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2009/03/04/managing-rejection-and-success/">used to rejection</a> anyway!</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/04/">April</a> I officially resigned from Microsoft as a PM after only about 7 months (and 5 managers!) on the job. I knew this was a serious decision. In hindsight, I’m glad I did it. Quitting let me focus on other cool stuff that I was meaning to get into, like iPhone (now iOS) development. In the same month I finally <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/04/26/anime-nano-iphone-app-for-sale-free/">released an app to the iTunes App Store</a>, something I had wanted to do for years.</p>

<p>In May, I moved back to Ann Arbor to be near to my GF, which required me to pack all my crap into my Corolla and drive the whole way. I also flew to New Mexico for a wedding and got to hang out with my family. This probably explains why I have no blog posts for May 2010.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/06/">June</a> I mostly basked in the glory of my funemployment and took it easy (read: I marathoned Lost). I also tinkered with my existing iPhone app and enhanced it a bit, building up my Obj-C chops. I interviewed for some jobs here and there to test out the waters, but none ended up being fruitful. The incompetence of HR departments never ceases to amaze me, but I suppose that’s a topic for a different post.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/07/">July</a> I looked for some more opportunities to work with other companies. I didn’t end up teaming up with anyone, but a conversation I had during an “interview” led me to start development on Checkmate, my second app for the iPhone. I spent a fair amount of July developing and testing Checkmate. I also took a cool part-time gig with <a href="http://twitter.com/porcellinilibri">the coolest boss in history</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/08/">August</a> saw the release of <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/08/25/checkmate-for-foursquare-for-iphone-release/">Checkmate</a>, which was <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/25/checkmate-for-foursquare/">featured in a story on Mashable</a>! Thanks, Pete Cashmore! While Checkmate wasn’t (and it still isn’t) the perfect app, I learned a ton from developing it and gained a lot of confidence as well. I also discovered the <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/08/13/hung-truong-on-the-radio/">NPR news story of that time I went on a chocolate factory tour in Seattle</a>!</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/09/">September</a> was mostly spent improving Checkmate and learning about <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/09/09/what-i-learned-from-checkmate/">how to handle a paid app</a> in the App Store. Doing a paid app is a quite a bit different than a free one. I also spent some time looking for an old printing press and finally <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/09/27/new-addition-to-the-home-mortimer-the-letterpress/">scored one on craigslist</a>!</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/10/">October</a>, I started working on another app that eventually became ♥s Threadless. This was the biggest undertaking I’ve done so far on iOS, and it also required me to do more complicated work in App Engine than I had done before. I also spent October tracking down supplies for my Letterpress machine, and ended up doing my first prints ever: <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/10/14/letterpress-coasters-giraffe/">Giraffe Coasters</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/10/14/letterpress-coasters-giraffe/giraffe-coaster/" rel="attachment wp-att-2056"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Giraffe-Coaster.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="" title="Giraffe Coaster" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-2056" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Giraffe-Coaster.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Giraffe-Coaster.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Giraffe-Coaster.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150 450w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/11/12/letterpress-business-cards/business-card-detail-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-2082"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Business-Card-Detail1.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="" title="Business Card Detail" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-2082" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Business-Card-Detail1.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Business-Card-Detail1.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Business-Card-Detail1.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150 450w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/11/28/loves-threadless-iphone-app-launch/threadless-shirt-view/" rel="attachment wp-att-2102"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Threadless-Shirt-View.png?resize=150%2C150" alt="" title="Threadless Shirt View" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-2102" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Threadless-Shirt-View.png?resize=150%2C150 150w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Threadless-Shirt-View.png?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>I split my <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/11/">November</a> into days where I’d work on getting better at printmaking (and coming up with stuff like these <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/11/">letterpress business cards</a>) and days where I’d work on the Threadless app. I finally ended up <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/11/28/loves-threadless-iphone-app-launch/">releasing the Threadless app</a> at the end of November. The reception of the app has been great! So far the app has 6 perfect reviews and one 4-star review. That makes me incredibly happy.</p>

<p>This brings us to the current month, <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/12/">December</a>. I started another app engine project that’s not quite ready for public beta yet (though I feel it will be really soon). Because of the app, Threadless was super cool and invited me to their Chicago headquarters. I finally realized one of my lifelong dreams of <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/12/27/hung-truong-threadless-model/">becoming a Threadless t-shirt model</a>! I’ve also been hanging out in Albuquerque and spoiling my nephew rotten for a few weeks.</p>

<p>And that is my 2010 year in review. One surprising thing is that many times during 2010, I was really down on myself. But looking back, I actually accomplished some neat stuff! I think it boils down to the fact that there’s still a lot of uncertainty in my life, and that’s hard to manage. But I think I’m getting better at managing it every day. In retrospect, 2010 was a great year, maybe even the best (so far).</p>

<p>Looking at 2011, I see a lot of opportunity. I’m going to continue to remind myself that minor setbacks are just that. I’ll push through them and accomplish even more than I did in 2010! My role model for 2011 is this guy:</p>

<p>Hopefully I’ll have some good stuff to report in a year or so!</p>

        <p><p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Threadless-Exterior.jpg" rel="lightbox[2165]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Threadless-Exterior-500x375.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="" title="Threadless Exterior" width="500" height="375" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2166" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Threadless-Exterior.jpg?resize=500%2C375 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Threadless-Exterior.jpg?w=640 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Last week I took a train out to visit Chicago for a meeting with my favorite company, Threadless! Since I wrote <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/11/28/loves-threadless-iphone-app-launch/">that app</a> I’ve been in contact with the founder et al, and they thought it would be cool for me to check out their offices. I won’t talk about what discussions went on (I’m being held by a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_disclosure_agreement">frieNd-DA</a>“), but I can say that the Threadless office is mega sweet!</p>

<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Funkalicious-and-friends.jpg" rel="lightbox[2165]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Funkalicious-and-friends.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="" title="Funkalicious and friends" width="500" height="375" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2167" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Funkalicious-and-friends.jpg?resize=500%2C375 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Funkalicious-and-friends.jpg?w=640 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>I got to hang out with some of the developers on Threadless and talked about the site and other random stuff (like t-shirt quality through the ages). I pointed out something that actually ended up being a bug that one of the dudes fixed almost immediately! Talk about transparency. At some point we were talking about how the Threadless t-shirt models are picked. Ivan (super nice guy) mentioned that the photographer might be looking for someone to model a shirt. He ended up replying and I got to model a brand new Threadless shirt in the cold, cold December Chicago air. The shirt’s called <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/2628/To_The_Birds?streetteam=notoupee">…To The Birds</a>. Buy it today!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/2628/To_The_Birds?streetteam=notoupee"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/HungThreadlessModel2.jpg?resize=308%2C460" alt="" title="HungThreadlessModel2" width="308" height="460" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2179" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The Threadless office itself is pretty nice. They moved in relatively recently so it still looks a little bare. Apparently they have big plans for decorating. I was, once again, super star struck by seeing people who I feel I know very well through their pictures on the Threadless site. I met the beard guy, Red the dog (I think it’s a Shiba Inu) and other assorted celebrities. One of the developers I met was the guy in the <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/2328/Mr_Tee?streetteam=notoupee">Mr Tee</a> photo and another was Mario in another shirt (I couldn’t figure out which one). Oh, and I said hi to Colleen and Kristen, who I first <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/03/17/sxsw-2010-official-celebrity-sighting-namedropping-post/">met at SXSW</a>!</p>

<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Shirt-stock.jpg" rel="lightbox[2165]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Shirt-stock.jpg?resize=450%2C600" alt="" title="Shirt stock" width="450" height="600" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2169" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Shirt-stock.jpg?resize=450%2C600 450w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Shirt-stock.jpg?w=480 480w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>They let me go down to the warehouse and pick out some shirts to take home. It kind of took all the willpower in my being not to clean them out (they probably would not have let me). I got <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/106/Upso?streetteam=notoupee">Upso</a>, <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/1354/Mister_Mittens_Big_Adventure?streetteam=notoupee">Mister Mittens</a> and <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/2598/Hound_s_Tooth?streetteam=notoupee">Houndstooth</a>. I also got a cool <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/668/I_Heart_Threadless?streetteam=notoupee">I â™¥ Threadless shirt</a> that they don’t really sell anymore. Limited edition!</p>

<p>This is probably already obvious, but Threadless is an awesome place with some awesome people making awesome things (mostly shirts). I had a blast meeting the people behind it and I hope I can come back again really soon!</p>

<p>Yesterday I printed out some fun cactus holiday cards and today I put them on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/63760636/letterpress-cactus-holiday-card">Etsy</a>. This is my first time making cards using a decent quality paper (Arturo Stationery from <a href="http://www.hollanders.com/">Hollander’s</a>). I got the cactus print block from Ebay and hand-set the type that says “Happy Holidays!”</p>

<p>I’m pretty happy with the result. I may end up buying the supplies to use photopolymer plates (a metal base) because this is way, way fun!</p>
