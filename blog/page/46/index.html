<p>A few days ago I had some lunch with a colleague of mine in Albuquerque at El Patio. It was pretty good except for the fact that I ordered a blue corn spinach enchilada and I got a normal enchilada, but I only realized it after I ate about 90% of it because I was hungry for green chile.</p>

<p>Anyway, after the lunch we went to scope out the area. The “Brick Light District,” as it’s called, is fairly new. It wasn’t there when I went to UNM. I saw this store that had a sign: “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090803155240/http://tokyohardcorelove.com/">Tokyo Hardcore Pop Culture Shoppe</a>.” We went in.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was a Domo-kun plushie. Pretty cool. Then I noticed some other random Japanese culture stuff. Hello Kitty stuff, birthday candles that spelled out “omedetou,” vinyl toys, etc. It kind of reminded me of <a href="http://www.basugasubakuhatsu.com/blog/2007/03/28/wizzywig-anime-store-review/">Wizzywig</a>, except with less emphasis on video game and anime pop culture and more on fashion and toy culture.</p>

<p>I talked to the store clerk girl for a little bit about the store. Apparently there are less people that come in who are “our age” and more really young people and fairly old people. Interesting. She said they opened maybe a few months ago and that they’re getting cool new items in regularly.</p>

<p>I’m pretty happy that a store like this exists in my (former) town. I think it adds a lot to the vibe that Albuquerque is one of those culturally interesting cities. I think I read somewhere that we’re somewhere up there with Austin and Seattle, etc. So I hope the store does well. Also, the girl at the counter was really cute, in that Suicide Girls kind of way.</p>

</p>

<p>So… IBM is making a ThinkPad with a screen, AND ANOTHER SCREEN INSIDE OF IT!</p>

<p>While the extra resolution might be kinda handy, I think it’s a bit much to put this on a notebook. Plus check out the thickness of the border between the screens. Definitely not very pretty. If they were designing the extra screen specifically for this device, couldn’t they have integrated it a bit better?</p>

<p>Also, I think this is a hoax, even if it shows up on the IBM website. I won’t believe it until I see it in person!</p>

</p>

<p>Today, December 18th (it might be the 19th by the time I finish this post), is my good friend Wolfie’s birthday. His name is John, but his nickname is Wolfie. It might seem weird for me to write a post about my pal’s birthday. I guess the reason I’m writing it is because Wolfie passed away this Summer while on a trip in Barcelona, Spain. He would’ve been 25 today.</p>

<p>I could be sad and dwell on how unfair it was that Wolfie wasn’t able to even see his 25th birthday. But when I think about him, it’s really hard to be sad, or mad, or anything besides happy.</p>

<p>We had some really good times, and I’m really glad I was able to meet him. He was one of my best friends for a good portion of high school. And we had great antics. Like the times we (and Patrick) went to the state fair and annoyed people on the expo floor, or the time Wolfie sneaked into David Tod’s house to steal a picture of David Tod in a bunny suit on Easter, scanned it and replaced it while I stood lookout a la Hitchcock’s Rear Window, or the time we recorded a drum, guitar and trumpet track of a song with just the two of us, or all the random junk we did on band trips.</p>

<p>He didn’t have a lot of time here, but he sure packed a lot into what he had. I guess it sounds cliche, but it’s true. And in a way, Wolfie has really inspired me to make the most of my time. I really hope that I never end up sleepwalking through life, aimless, because that would be a waste of time that I have, that Wolfie never had.</p>

<p>While I’m writing about lessons, I also want to say that throughout everything that happened, Wolfie’s mother, Mera, has been nothing but positive. She sent an email (which I won’t reproduce without her permission) reminding us to celebrate his life, all the good times, etc. She’s really the sweetest person I’ve ever met. Much love to her (I hope I can catch up with her before I leave town this time). She’s an inspiration and I hope I can be more like her someday.</p>

<p>In conclusion: Happy Birthday, Wolfie! I miss you.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2008/12/13/the-semi-annual-post-finals-bad-dream/">The Semi-Annual Post-Finals Bad Dream!</a></h3>
        <p><p>So whenever I finish finals, I always seem to have the same bad dream. It’s not a nightmare or anything. Just a dream that’s sort of got a bad scenario in it. I just finished my final stuff yesterday, so the semi-annual dream came right on time, last night!</p>

<p>It always involves some random class I signed up for at the beginning of the semester that I stop showing up to. Then I realize, maybe on the bus or something, that I totally forgot to do any work for it!!! This semester it was some made up class on something analysis. The reason I didn’t go is because the teacher was really bad. For some reason the teacher was Jay Boyden, a grad student assistant from when I was in marching band in undergrad. No idea why he was in that role because he’s actually a good teacher!</p>

<p>My series of dreams last night also involved some interesting sub-plots. One was that I was using my computer to show my brother something, then the browser was being really slow switching from Youtube to whatever other tab I had open. So I blamed this on the OS and remembered I had a copy of Vista! So I formatted the hard drive out of frustration and was going to find the Vista disc. But then I realized I had left the disc in Michigan, and for some reason I was in New Mexico for the dream (I wonder what my computer was doing in NM while my stuff was in MI). So I just had a formatted computer.</p>

<p>Then another sub-plot was sorta in the world of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FBS20?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FBS20">I Am Legend</a>” and sorta in the world of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYUS4Y?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001EYUS4Y">Fallout 3</a>.” There was a town I was trying to get to but a zombie town was in-between it! I think the zombies couldn’t get out at night. But it WAS at night. Luckily some motorcycle gang was there to shoot flamethrowers at the zombie town so I could pass. Before this happened, though, there was huge pomp and circumstance. Like the motorcycles all came in formation and stuff. Then the zombies were kind of trash talking the gang. They said something like, “you guys are done for when you eventually run out of gasoline!” Then the gang torched the zombies and I was on my way.</p>

<p>So yeah, I’m looking forward to my final semi-annual post-final bad dream some time in May when I graduate!</p>
