<p>I’ve had my eye on this handsome panflute flowchart t-shirt from <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/">Toothpaste For Dinner</a> for a while. I just didn’t feel like spending $21 on it. The sheer awesomeness of it won out in the end, however. I’m happy to say that Panflute Flowchart will be arriving any day now.</p>

<p>And no, you don’t need a panflute.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2007/01/30/ruby-on-rails-on-media-temples-dv-on-plesk-on/">Ruby on Rails on Media Temple&#8217;s (dv) on Plesk on&#8230;</a></h3>
        <p><p style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/rails.png?w=604" alt="rails.png" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>So I’ve been fiddling around with trying to get my rails applications installed on Media Temple’s (dv) 3 server. It’s a pretty nice setup; basically a dedicated server (though virtual) that you can play around with to your heart’s content.</p>

<p>While they “support” Plesk 8.1 which in turn supports ruby on rails, they do not offer support for ruby on rails installation. Since I’m a pretty hardcore CS guy, I don’t mind learning stuff. It is easier when there’s support people to help you though.</p>

<p>At first I had tried using rails with fastcgi, but that’s apparently a bad idea. The dv supports fcgid anyway. Media Temple’s support told me it was already installed, but guess what? It wasn’t. I had to go into plesk and get the updater to install it.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to get my apps to run for more than a week now. I’ve been working on it in my free time, and I finally got one of them to actually start doing something. There were a bunch of hurdles I had to jump over just to get it to work.</p>

<p>Here’s the last thing I needed to do:</p>

<p>I was getting some “Application error: Rails application failed to start properly” errors. The rails log wasn’t too helpful. The httpd one wasn’t either. I looked in the /var/log/httpd/suexec_log file and it said stuff like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[2007-01-30 15:36:58]: file is writable by others: (/var/www/…/public/dispatch.fcgi)</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">
  I thought, &#8220;well okay, it's just a warning.&#8221; Who cares if it's group writable? After doing some other random stuff, and changing the permissions accidentally, I got this:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">
  [2007-01-30 15:32:30]: file has no execute permission: (/var/www/&#8230;/public/dispatch.fcgi)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so now it’s complaining that it has no execute permission. Whoops. I chmodded it to something like 775 and I get the “file is writable by others” thing again, along with the application error. So I thought, “what the heck” and chmodded the file to a safer 755. It seems that did the job, so now I can execute the app!</p>

<p>I never knew that apache (or suexec or fcgid or whatever the heck is running dispatch.fcgi) really cared so much about permissions. I’ll have to be more thoughtful of logfiles from now on…</p>

</p>

<p>So I was playing with my new Wii. The sports game that comes with it is really fun. One game that I suck at in real life, but can do okay in with Wii sports is Baseball. Unfortunately, I just lost my first game. I think the game gets harder as your skill level progresses.</p>

<p>The first game, I got like, 11 runs or something. And there’s only 3 innings! I’d say that Wii Baseball is probably the most physically challenging, since you’re either flinging the remote as fast as possible when pitching, or doing an actual bat swing when batting. Eventually I got tired of doing the whole “hey batter batter” thing and just used one hand. I still use two when I’m not sore, though.</p>

<p>During my first loss, I found out that there’s a mercy rule. Yep, when you have 0 runs and the opponent has 5, it’s time to just give up. This is pretty much crap, since on my first game, I won by like, 10 runs or so. I totally would’ve made a sick comeback, too. Stupid Wii baseball…</p>

<p>Back in High School, my friend Jennae wrote a song entitled “Hung Truong Is The Sexiest Man Alive.” While cleaning up my room, I found the original manuscript, so I decided to put it up on my blog for your reading pleasure. I think it started out as a one verse joke that got a little carried away. The song is pretty long, a veritable five page opus, so here are the main points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I, Hung Truong, am the sexiest man alive</li>
  <li>Women want me, and men want to be like me</li>
  <li>The singer wishes she was my girlfriend, but she can’t be because I’m too good for her because I am the sexiest man alive</li>
  <li>It is a fact that I am alive, and not dead</li>
  <li>I can beat up superheroes and look better in their clothing</li>
  <li>I am courageous and I recite poetry eloquently</li>
  <li>A large statue of myself erected in the city center would be desirable to the singer</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I can get Jennae to record it and release the thing as an MP3! If you want the long version, look no further. Since I’m narcissistic and bored, I’ve typed out the whole thing:</p>

  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VXBAQ?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=b00003ph0-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325&#038;creativeASIN=B0009VXBAQ"><img id="image448" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/Wii%20Box.jpg?w=604" alt="Wii Box.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</center>

<p>That’s right! Two months after the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VXBAQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0009VXBAQ">Wii</a> was released in America, I finally got it! Yesterday was some kind of national Wii holiday. Apparently 1/21/06 was the day for all retailers to hold the Wii. This is probably why I couldn’t find one in stock for the past two weeks since my last attempt.</p>

<p>I decided to head over to Circuit City around 9am. That’s an hour before they open. I was surprised to see two guys standing there. They told me that the Circuit City guys only had 2 Wiis to sell to the general public, and that the others would go to their pre-order customers. False Advertsising!!! I’m probably going to file a compaint.</p>

<p>Next I got to Best Buy around 9:30. I was under the impression that the store would open at 11am, since that’s what the online store checker thing said. The opening time was actually 10am. So I got there only 30 minutes early. I saw a pretty long line and counted around 38 people in front of me. Still, I figured they might have a ton; they’re Best Buy.</p>

<p>So once 10am rolls along, they start herding us in there like cattle. One person remarked that it was a good sign that they didn’t hand out tickets. There must be enough for everyone in line. We snaked around the store until we got to the video game section. There we waited for each person to pick up a Wii and move along. It was kind of like the Soup Nazi thing from Seinfeld. When I finally get to the Wiis, there are about 3 left after mine. My linemates and I all share some high tens.</p>

<p>In my daze of my accomplishment, I decided to also pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQBPCQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000FQBPCQ">Legend of Zelda: Twighlight Princess</a> at full price. This is even though I know I can get it cheaper. I’m a tool like that. I didn’t even use a gamer’s gift card…</p>

<p>As far as the Wii goes, it’s pretty darn cool. The remote control is neat because it can give you some vibration feedback when you’re going over buttons. The IR sensor is still kind of inaccurate, but maybe I need to do some more calibration.</p>

<p>Wii Sports is insanely fun. I could probably play the bowling game for hours at a time. That is, if my arm wasn’t so sore right now. My mom even played it, and did really well in bowling. My dad couldn’t quite get the hang of releasing the button before throwing the ball.</p>

<p>Zelda is pretty cool, but the graphics seem kind of lacking. I’m gonna go get a component cable and see if that doesn’t help things. I think the Wii graphics are only slightly better than the Gamecube, which was actually the strongest console of the last generation…</p>

<p>Another cool thing is that the Wii has full backwards compatibility for the Gamecube. You just flip open the top and find some memory card slots and controller ports. I really wish there was an option to save to internal memory, though. It kind of blows that I need to keep using the very small Gamecube memory card.</p>

<p>All in all, I think the Wii is very cool. Hopefully the good games will keep rolling in. I might have to pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPW2QO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000GPW2QO">Trauma Center</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQ9YB0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000FQ9YB0">Wario Ware</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KRXAGE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000KRXAGE">Wii Play</a> is coming out soon, too.</p>
