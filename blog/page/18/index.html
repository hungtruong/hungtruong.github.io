<p>I finally heard about <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> enough times (I suppose I reached my contagion threshold) to make a profile for it a week or so ago, and I ended up exploring it in depth today.</p>

<p>Quora is basically a site that lets you ask questions and answer other people’s questions. Facebook also just recently released a feature called Questions that seems sort of similar. While Quora hasn’t put limits on what kinds of questions you can ask, the bulk seem to be about technology and startups, probably because of the types of early adopters who are using the site.</p>

<p>Quora is interesting to me because it’s basically enabling people to share knowledge. In a way, it’s like Wikipedia, but with a seemingly smaller barrier to entry. While Wikipedia has some harsh rules on how to edit an article, Quora is centered around questions and answers on various topics. You can literally sign up and answer questions within a few minutes.</p>

<p>As with any great piece of social software, Quora seems to work because it makes the right things visible, which gives incentives for people to keep contributing. Personally, I see it as a way to build up my online reputation as an expert on a number of subjects. It’s interesting because the incentives to use the site are baked into the site itself. It’s easy to see who has answered many questions, who has a lot of followers, who has been “endorsed” by others, etc. With this system, pretty much everyone wins. The question askers have their questions answered, the answerers get the glory of answering a question well, and even users who do neither can still benefit from reading good answers to good questions.</p>

<p>Another neat aspect of the site is that there are many users who could be considered “internet celebrities” or important in some other right. There are many founders of companies and other execs who go to the trouble of answering questions about the companies they founded. This is cool because users are all sort of on the same level (or at least have the potential to be). Think of the opportunities if you were one of the first 1000 people on Twitter and could have great conversations with the other early adopters.</p>

<p>From playing around with it a bit today, I’m very impressed and excited about Quora. By comparison, I just goofed off on Facebook Questions and unlocked the Rickroll Easter Egg (ask “How is babby formed?”). Quora still has a few things it could do better (like make it easier to find really great answers to really great questions, perhaps older ones) but even now it seems like a great tool. With the right attention to detail and community, I feel like it could be the next Wikipedia in terms of social computing success stories.</p>

<p>Oh, and here’s an example of a really good answer to a question: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-is-Facebook-creating-a-Q-A-product-to-compete-against-Quora">Why is Facebook creating a Q&amp;A product to compete against Quora?</a></p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2010/09/09/what-i-learned-from-checkmate/">What I Learned From Checkmate</a></h3>
        <p><p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CheckMate-Foursquare-Logo.png?resize=220%2C120" alt="" title="CheckMate-Foursquare-Logo" width="220" height="120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>Just about two weeks ago, I <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/08/25/checkmate-for-foursquare-for-iphone-release/">released my first paid iPhone app</a>, <a href="http://www.checkinmate.com/">Checkmate</a>. The experience has been priceless, plus I made a few bucks as well. I thought I’d share the stuff I learned, both technical and otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="technical">Technical:</h3>

<p><strong>Core Location.</strong> Being the first iPhone app I’ve done that uses Core Location, I learned a lot about the process of starting up the location manager, filtering location updates and getting them to work in the background. The background stuff is pretty new, just released in iOS 4.</p>

<p><strong>Design takes thought.</strong> One of the most difficult things in designing an app is balancing between user expectations (“it should work like magic”) and real-world constraints (battery, accuracy tradeoffs). I’ve taken the approach of leaving the details under the hood (another app that does something similar gives users full control) for simplicity. This is a deliberate design decision. I’ve found that many users are happy with the app, and some are unhappy. I assume there is a minority that is unhappy, but that they seem to be more vocal (more on that later).</p>

<p><strong>Core Data.</strong> I also learned about Core Data, since I use that for storing venue data persistently. There’s a bit of a learning curve with Core Data, but I have a pretty good idea of how it works. I guess it helps that I’ve designed a bunch of database schema in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Get to good enough.</strong> I definitely feel like I have accomplished something by releasing the app. I have wrestled in the past between releasing something when it’s “good enough” but not getting stuck in perfectionist limbo. In the case of Checkmate, I got to a point where I was happy enough with its performance (it works) and did not want to delay any further, lest I lose steam and give up on ever releasing it. Now that I’ve gotten a feedback loop going, it’ll be easier to improve and update the app anyway. As far as interface design goes, the app is a bit clunky for my taste. Having admitted that, I think I could go back and make some things more obvious (like the login screen) and polish up the user experience.</p>

<h3 id="business-ey">Business-ey</h3>

<p><strong>Ask for reviews.</strong> Ask satisfied customers for reviews. Because if you don’t, only the unhappy users will post them. And you’ll end up getting a pretty bad average rating. Even if your app makes crap into gold, there will be users who don’t see the value in it, or think that $2 is too much to pay. Encourage users to post reviews in-app and you’ll see a well-rounded view of what people think about your app.</p>

<p><strong>It’s okay to have a competitor.</strong> While developing my app, I found that another similar app had launched and gotten some press from Techcrunch. This was a bit depressing as I wanted to have that exposure. I ended up using it as a motivator since the blog post and app validated my own idea. There’s always room for competition, especially if you can outdo them.</p>

<p><strong>Popular takes all on the App Store.</strong> There have been blog posts on the subject of iTunes ranking and how valuable it is to make a top 100 list. Apps seem to be ranked in search based on their sales volume, which means that popular apps will become more popular. Having been featured on <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/25/checkmate-for-foursquare/">Mashable</a> at launch, my app got to #2 for a “foursquare” search. This helped a lot for residual sales. I’m assuming that most apps are sold directly from app store searches. There are other ways to discover apps.</p>

<p><strong>Have fun!</strong> It was really exhilarating to see my app get into the app store and into the hands of users. I set up a <a href="https://twitter.com/checkmateapp">twitter account</a> to communicate with users, monitored twitter searches for my app and answered emails sent through a contact form on my website. It was really fun having people react to work that I did. It’s probably one of the strongest motivators for me to keep doing what I’m doing.</p>

<p>I have learned a great deal from my first commercial app launch. I’m really glad that I had an idea and stuck with it to completion. I’m still learning a great deal from Checkmate. I know that this experience will make the launch of my next product/app (whatever it might be) more smooth, both for me and users!</p>

<p>My second iPhone app, <a href="http://www.checkinmate.com/">Checkmate</a>, just got approved in the Apple App Store last night. It’s an auto-check-in app that runs in the background. You select your favorite venues, and Checkmate will check you into them when you get close enough, even when the phone is still in your pocket! I wrote this app because I got annoyed at forgetting to check into places on foursquare while there.</p>

<p>Like a good data nerd, I downloaded the list of <a href="http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/?p=887">publicly available Facebook names</a>, dumped into text files. I was trying to figure out a neat way to use them. It’s always weird when people have the same first and last names, so I wrote a quick regex to find people with names like “John John” and “Laura Laura.” I used <em>/^([a-z]+) \1$/</em>, but maybe there’s a better one. I think mine left out the middle names.</p>

<p>Apparently there are a lot of people with the same first and last name. 14,495 in my list, to be exact. But that’s out of a 100 million or so (I only did unique names). <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/stupid.txt">Here’s the list</a> for anyone who might care. I’m trying to figure out a more useful application for this dataset. Any ideas?</p>

        <p><p><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/iAD_marketing.png?resize=191%2C221" alt="" title="iAD_marketing" width="191" height="221" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1985" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>I recently read an essay by Paul Graham on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html">what happened to Yahoo</a>. In it, he describes how Yahoo acted like a media company when it was really technology company, and how funky management made it into what it is today. One quote struck me as relevant today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme. Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo’s revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in. When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of “Eureka!” I was shouting “Sell!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/08/11/anime-nano-iphone-app-update/">just integrated iAd</a> into one of my iPhone apps I’ve noticed that pretty much all of the ads are for other apps. Most of these apps are “free,” and I assume that they could potentially be using iAd for revenue as well. This is a result of low fill rates for iAd and Apple wanting to offer developers a way to advertise their apps. It makes sense, but one has to wonder exactly where all the money is eventually going (Apple gets a 40% cut of iAd revenue), and who has the incentive to keep that system running.</p>

<p>A while ago I wrote my <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/07/02/thoughts-and-predictions-on-apples-iad-platform/">predictions for iAd</a>. I didn’t foresee Apple opening iAds up to developers who wanted to advertise their apps. That’ll help the fill rate, but I can’t see it helping CPMs when developers have something like a $0.25 CPC and it was reported that the larger media campaigns like Dove were closer to $2 CPC. Seems like another race to the bottom, just like paid app prices.</p>
