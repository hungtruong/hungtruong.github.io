<p>I met a recruiter from this company called <a href="https://imo.im/">imo.im</a> last week at the Mpowered career fair on North Campus. Basically, the event was a career fair for startup companies. For some reason, some really big companies were there as well. I think I saw NEC…</p>

<p>Anyway, imo.im is some sort of web-based IM client, kind of like Meebo. I even asked the recruiter something like, “I’m sure you get asked this a lot, but this company is like Meebo, right?” Anyway, it seems the claim to fame for imo.im is that they’re financed almost exclusively by one of the first 10 employees of Google. This post isn’t really about their company though. It’s about their HR!</p>

<p>There were a bunch of t-shirts on the table. I, being a t-shirt connoisseur, especially of the company shwag type, asked if I could have one. “But they’re reserved for interviewees,” the HR person Marissa Huang told me. She also said she could mail me one when she gets back to their headquarters, since they have a lot. I gave her my contact info and figured I’d never get the shirt. Here’s a story!</p>

<p>When I went to interview at Google, they said I’d get some kind of awesome bag with Google related goodies in it. Like shirts and lava lamps and whatnot. Maybe not lava lamps. Anyway, it was supposed to be in my hotel room but I never got it. After the HR person at Google asked for my address for them to mail it, I felt that I’d get the stuff for sure, but I never did. It was like adding insult to the injury of not hiring me. By the way, I’ve fully recovered and hold no ill will towards the big G. Just throwing out this story to prove a point: why would imo.im go to the trouble of sending me a shirt when I didn’t even interview with them?</p>

<p>But they did. And it came today. Which is why I award imo.im the official “Hung Truong Company Shwag Award Seal of Approval!” I don’t know if something can be both an award AND a seal of approval at the same time, but whatever. There was also a nice hand-written note in the package, which is unheard of as far as corporate HR goes. But imo.im is a startup, so I guess that makes them different.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks, <a href="https://imo.im/">imo.im</a>, for the t-shirt. As a bonus, I’m even not adding a rel=”nofollow” to my links to you! Rock on!</p>

<p>Well, it didn’t take long for Rick Astley to get out of my head. While on shuffle, my iTunes played the Bob Mintzer version of “My Foolish Heart” sung by Kurt Elling. It’s really a nice ballad. And the arrangement by Mintzer is nice and slightly weird as is his style.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a line between love and fascination,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s hard to see on an evening such as this,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For they give the very same sensation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you are lost in the passion of a kiss.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this time it isn’t fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s love, this time it’s love, my foolish heart!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, as usual when I get a standard stuck in my head, it’s really friggin’ stuck in my head!</p>

It all started as a joke. A RickRoll. Following a link like "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY3QLJsf6I0">Starcraft 2 leaked trailer!</a>" and instead being presented with a video of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up."

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2008/03/09/2003-the-missing-blog-year/">2003: The Missing Blog Year</a></h3>
        <p><p>So for some reason I was looking at the archives of my blog today. I noticed that there was a gap between the years of 2004 and 2003. I obviously didn’t stop blogging completely in 2003, so I figured something was up.</p>

<p>I’ve been blogging for a number of years now. The earliest protoblog I had was probably on ujournal.org. After that I switched around a lot, to places like Xanga, livejournal, Myspace (ugh, yeah, I know) and finally to my own domain where my blog resides today. I’ve made it a point to export all my old blog entries though, so I was kind of pissed to see that 2003 was nowhere to be found. Sure enough, I checked out my old livejournal (which still exists!) and exported all the posts from 2003 into my blog this afternoon.</p>

<p>A few notes on my blogging style of 2003:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I used exclamation points in my titles a lot.</li>
  <li>I mostly blogged about news events. Unfortunately, Yahoo News links die fairly fast.</li>
  <li>All links referencing my UNM webspace are seriously borked</li>
  <li>For some reason I wrote about Ebay a lot!</li>
  <li>In 2003, my blog really sucked.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few noteworthy posts from that year, including the <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2003/11/10/self-imaging/">self imaging post</a> (which links to a broken site now…), the <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2003/07/10/and-do-it-eeeebay/">Ebay commercial post</a> (which links to a working video!!!) and my rant about <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2003/02/12/all-the-kings-horses/">Humpty Dumpty</a>.</p>

<p>You can see all the missing posts <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2003/">here</a>. If you really wanted to. Which you probably don’t.</p>
