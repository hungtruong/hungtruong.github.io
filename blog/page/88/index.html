        <p><center>
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VXBAQ?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=b00003ph0-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325&#038;creativeASIN=B0009VXBAQ"><img id="image448" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/Wii%20Box.jpg?w=604" alt="Wii Box.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</center>

<p>That’s right! Two months after the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VXBAQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0009VXBAQ">Wii</a> was released in America, I finally got it! Yesterday was some kind of national Wii holiday. Apparently 1/21/06 was the day for all retailers to hold the Wii. This is probably why I couldn’t find one in stock for the past two weeks since my last attempt.</p>

<p>I decided to head over to Circuit City around 9am. That’s an hour before they open. I was surprised to see two guys standing there. They told me that the Circuit City guys only had 2 Wiis to sell to the general public, and that the others would go to their pre-order customers. False Advertsising!!! I’m probably going to file a compaint.</p>

<p>Next I got to Best Buy around 9:30. I was under the impression that the store would open at 11am, since that’s what the online store checker thing said. The opening time was actually 10am. So I got there only 30 minutes early. I saw a pretty long line and counted around 38 people in front of me. Still, I figured they might have a ton; they’re Best Buy.</p>

<p>So once 10am rolls along, they start herding us in there like cattle. One person remarked that it was a good sign that they didn’t hand out tickets. There must be enough for everyone in line. We snaked around the store until we got to the video game section. There we waited for each person to pick up a Wii and move along. It was kind of like the Soup Nazi thing from Seinfeld. When I finally get to the Wiis, there are about 3 left after mine. My linemates and I all share some high tens.</p>

<p>In my daze of my accomplishment, I decided to also pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQBPCQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000FQBPCQ">Legend of Zelda: Twighlight Princess</a> at full price. This is even though I know I can get it cheaper. I’m a tool like that. I didn’t even use a gamer’s gift card…</p>

<p>As far as the Wii goes, it’s pretty darn cool. The remote control is neat because it can give you some vibration feedback when you’re going over buttons. The IR sensor is still kind of inaccurate, but maybe I need to do some more calibration.</p>

<p>Wii Sports is insanely fun. I could probably play the bowling game for hours at a time. That is, if my arm wasn’t so sore right now. My mom even played it, and did really well in bowling. My dad couldn’t quite get the hang of releasing the button before throwing the ball.</p>

<p>Zelda is pretty cool, but the graphics seem kind of lacking. I’m gonna go get a component cable and see if that doesn’t help things. I think the Wii graphics are only slightly better than the Gamecube, which was actually the strongest console of the last generation…</p>

<p>Another cool thing is that the Wii has full backwards compatibility for the Gamecube. You just flip open the top and find some memory card slots and controller ports. I really wish there was an option to save to internal memory, though. It kind of blows that I need to keep using the very small Gamecube memory card.</p>

<p>All in all, I think the Wii is very cool. Hopefully the good games will keep rolling in. I might have to pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPW2QO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000GPW2QO">Trauma Center</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQ9YB0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000FQ9YB0">Wario Ware</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KRXAGE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000KRXAGE">Wii Play</a> is coming out soon, too.</p>

</center>

<p>I saw this offer on <a href="http://www.slickdeals.net/?permadeal=8852#direct_deal_8852">Slickdeals</a> for a 12-month subscription to Nintendo Power for like, <a href="http://www.bestdealmagazines.com/title.asp?title=NINTENDO+POWER">$5</a>. It got me to thinking about how cool Nintendo Power used to be. That’s right, used to be…</p>

<p>I remember getting a subscription to Nintendo Power when they had an awesome promotion where you got Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest in Japan) with a year’s subscription. That’s right, you got a video game for subscribing to Nintendo Power! The deal was too sweet to pass up, so I finally convinced my mom to get me the magazine. I ended up getting addicted to RPGs because of Dragon Warrior, too.</p>

<p>I pretty much learned how to read on Nintendo Power. It was so awesome. Nintendo Power would usually have entire maps of games laid out on two pages. I’d sit there and plan out how the game would actually play, even though I never ended up playing the actual games.</p>

<p>I also recall there being some pretty cool comic strips like the Metroid one and Zelda one. There was also a comic about the origins of Wario, which was really weird in retrospect.</p>

<p>I remember always trying to win prizes in the survey contests in each issue. They would be ridiculous prizes, like “win every single SNES game ever!” Too bad I never won…</p>

<p>I guess my love affair with Nintendo Power ended with the whole Playstation generation thing. Like the Playstation got FFVII, and the Nintendo 64 graphics were horrible. I didn’t even get a Nintendo 64 (though my cousin did, and we had a blast with Goldeneye). Plus I realized that Nintendo Power was probably the most biased publication ever. I don’t think I ever saw a score below 7.0. And there were definitely Nintendo games that were seriously bad.</p>

<p>I did end up getting a Gamecube, and I really want to get a Wii. Maybe it’s time I resubscribed to Nintendo Power… Then again, do I really want to pay $5 for a subscription to Nintendo ads?</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2007/01/16/giant-steps-reunion-ska-lives-maybe/">Giant Steps Reunion! Ska Lives! Maybe…</a></h3>
        <p><p>So last month, this band called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/giantstepska">Giant Steps</a> had some kind of reunion going on. I was a dummy and didn’t go. But The band played on anyway and Tom Siegel, trumpet player, sent me a link to some videos of the event. I didn’t wanna kill their bandwidth, so I’m putting up the clips on my own site.</p>

<p>Giant Steps was a local (Albuquerque) ska band that was pretty popular during the “third wave” of ska. I’d pin that era somewhere around 1996 to uh, 2000 or so. At least, that’s when the third wave was most popular. As far as I know, Reel Big Fish is still doing their thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, Giant Steps was fairly well known to me, because two of my high school teachers were in it! My high school band teacher, Paul Blakey, played baritone sax, and Mr. Siegel, I mean… Tom played trumpet. How cool is that? I actually didn’t end up going to many of their gigs, but I did hear them live a few times.</p>

<p>One thing that Tom told me is that you can now buy <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=210447300">Giant Step’s CDs on iTunes</a>! How cool is that? I’d still rather have the hard copy though, for nostalgia purposes and whatnot.</p>

<p>Ooh. Also, I remember hearing that “Feel the Thunder” was written about Paul Blakey’s snoring. I’m not if this is true, but why would anyone lie about that?</p>

<p>On to the videos:</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2007/01/09/4-reasons-why-the-apple-iphone-will-fail/">4 Reasons Why The Apple iPhone Will Fail</a></h3>
        <p><center>
  <img id="image442" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/iPhone.jpg?w=604" alt="iPhone.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</center>

<p>The focus of today’s Macworld 2007 was definitely the iPhone. While general consensus is that the iPhone is the next killer app, I still have my doubts. Here are 4 reasons why the Apple iPhone will fail:</p>

<p><strong>1. Public Acceptance:</strong></p>

<p>The average person doesn’t even use the WAP browser on their phone, let alone any full blown OSX apps! What people want in a mobile phone is a phone; they don’t need all of these extras. Extra software just makes it more difficult to perform the main function of the phone: to make phone calls.</p>

<p><strong>2. Price:</strong></p>

<p>The price of the iPhone was announced at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB with a 2 year contract. Right now, you can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM8REU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=basugasubakuhatsu-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000EM8REU">T-Mobile MDA smartphone</a> for $0 after rebate. The mass market is not willing to pay this much for a phone.</p>

<p><strong>3. Copyright and Regulations:</strong></p>

<p>There already is an iPhone out. It’s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JI5L02?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=basugasubakuhatsu-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000JI5L02">Linksys Wireless-G Skype iPhone</a>. I hope Apple has a lot of money or lawyers to acquire the rights to the name.</p>

<p>Pair this with the fact that the iPhone doesn’t have FCC approval and we might never see the iPhone get to market. How did Steve make all of those phone calls anyway?</p>

<p><strong>4. Battery Life:</strong></p>

<p>The iPhone runs OSX! This is great for a laptop or a desktop computer, but does a phone really need OSX? The battery life was announced as 5 hours of talk time, browsing, or video. Basically, 5 hours of active use. What happens after that? Your phone is dead and no one can call you.</p>

<p>People are not going to use the iPhone’s features for fear of losing their connectivity when the battery runs out.</p>

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/2007/01/08/presenting-unm-tactics-the-video-game/">Presenting UNM Tactics: The Video Game!</a></h3>
        <p><p><img id="image432" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/UNM%20Tactics.jpg?w=604" alt="UNM Tactics.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>Back in the Spring of 2005, I took an intro to video game design and programming class. While I had a pretty good background in programming, I hadn’t done the kind of stuff for video games before. The first assignment in the class was to come up with some kind of game concept that would end up being a project for the class.</p>

<p>I really love RPGs, and the more offbeat they are, the better. One of my favorites is Earthbound for the SNES. I also dig the SRPGs from Nippon Ichi like Disgaea. Originally I wanted to do a Strategy RPG in the setting of campus life. It was called “UNM Tactics!” The whole SRPG thing didn’t turn out so well, and in the end, we made a generic style university RPG instead.</p>

<p>We kept the name as UNM Tactics, even though it wasn’t really a tactics type game. We used RPG Maker XP, which is a really easy to use frontend system for, well, making RPGs. After pulling a few all nighters, we finished the final presentation, and as a pleasant surprise, I got an A+! After the class, I sorta forgot about the game, but I was reminded of it after watching that movie, College Saga.</p>

<p>From the readme:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UNM Tactics is an RPG set at the University of New Mexico. It was created by a team of programmers and artists for CS 491: Intro to Video Game Development. While a working demo was created, the game was never fully completed. This game is the demo that was used for the final class presentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/games/UNM Tactics.exe">download the game here</a> if you don’t want the story to be spoiled. The game comes in a self extracting executable. You just need to run it and point it to an output directory. Then run the “Game.exe” file and you’re good to go! The game should run on any Windows system, though I’ve only tested it on Windows XP. Use the <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/about/">contact form</a> if you need some support.</p>

<p>Now it’s time for screencaps and commentary!</p>
