    <p>Looking back at 2010, this year has been one of change and growth for me. I’d like to take a post and look back at what I did this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/01/">January</a> and <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/02/">February</a> were kinda uneventful. I was pretty nose down trying to become a good PM at Microsoft. Oh, and I was busy making troll posts about how the iPad was gonna suck and I wrote a lot of book and music reviews.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/03/">March</a>, I attended SXSW and <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/03/20/sxsw-2010-my-panel-moderator-experience/">moderated a panel</a> that I had submitted the year before on Student Startups. I met many of my friends who I hadn’t seen in a while and <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/03/17/sxsw-2010-official-celebrity-sighting-namedropping-post/">met a lot of cool new people</a>. It was from that experience that I decided I needed to stop doing what I was currently doing and change course so that I could do what I was “meant” to do. Also in March, I was rejected from the one PhD program I had applied to. In hindsight, this was probably a good thing. I’m <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2009/03/04/managing-rejection-and-success/">used to rejection</a> anyway!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/03/20/sxsw-2010-my-panel-moderator-experience/img_0119/" rel="attachment wp-att-1779"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_0119.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="SXSW Panel" title="SXSW Panel" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1779" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_0119.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_0119.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IMG_0119.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150 450w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/03/17/sxsw-2010-official-celebrity-sighting-namedropping-post/pete-cashmore/" rel="attachment wp-att-1768"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Pete-Cashmore.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="" title="Me + Pete Cashmore" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1768" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Pete-Cashmore.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Pete-Cashmore.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Pete-Cashmore.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150 450w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/04/26/anime-nano-iphone-app-for-sale-free/animenanoiphone/" rel="attachment wp-att-1845"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/AnimeNanoiPhone.png?resize=150%2C150" alt="" title="Anime Nano for iPhone" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1845" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/AnimeNanoiPhone.png?resize=150%2C150 150w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/AnimeNanoiPhone.png?resize=500%2C500 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/AnimeNanoiPhone.png?resize=50%2C50 50w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/AnimeNanoiPhone.png?w=512 512w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/04/">April</a> I officially resigned from Microsoft as a PM after only about 7 months (and 5 managers!) on the job. I knew this was a serious decision. In hindsight, I’m glad I did it. Quitting let me focus on other cool stuff that I was meaning to get into, like iPhone (now iOS) development. In the same month I finally <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/04/26/anime-nano-iphone-app-for-sale-free/">released an app to the iTunes App Store</a>, something I had wanted to do for years.</p>

<p>In May, I moved back to Ann Arbor to be near to my GF, which required me to pack all my crap into my Corolla and drive the whole way. I also flew to New Mexico for a wedding and got to hang out with my family. This probably explains why I have no blog posts for May 2010.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/06/">June</a> I mostly basked in the glory of my funemployment and took it easy (read: I marathoned Lost). I also tinkered with my existing iPhone app and enhanced it a bit, building up my Obj-C chops. I interviewed for some jobs here and there to test out the waters, but none ended up being fruitful. The incompetence of HR departments never ceases to amaze me, but I suppose that’s a topic for a different post.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/07/">July</a> I looked for some more opportunities to work with other companies. I didn’t end up teaming up with anyone, but a conversation I had during an “interview” led me to start development on Checkmate, my second app for the iPhone. I spent a fair amount of July developing and testing Checkmate. I also took a cool part-time gig with <a href="http://twitter.com/porcellinilibri">the coolest boss in history</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/08/">August</a> saw the release of <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/08/25/checkmate-for-foursquare-for-iphone-release/">Checkmate</a>, which was <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/25/checkmate-for-foursquare/">featured in a story on Mashable</a>! Thanks, Pete Cashmore! While Checkmate wasn’t (and it still isn’t) the perfect app, I learned a ton from developing it and gained a lot of confidence as well. I also discovered the <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/08/13/hung-truong-on-the-radio/">NPR news story of that time I went on a chocolate factory tour in Seattle</a>!</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/09/">September</a> was mostly spent improving Checkmate and learning about <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/09/09/what-i-learned-from-checkmate/">how to handle a paid app</a> in the App Store. Doing a paid app is a quite a bit different than a free one. I also spent some time looking for an old printing press and finally <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/09/27/new-addition-to-the-home-mortimer-the-letterpress/">scored one on craigslist</a>!</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/10/">October</a>, I started working on another app that eventually became ♥s Threadless. This was the biggest undertaking I’ve done so far on iOS, and it also required me to do more complicated work in App Engine than I had done before. I also spent October tracking down supplies for my Letterpress machine, and ended up doing my first prints ever: <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/10/14/letterpress-coasters-giraffe/">Giraffe Coasters</a>!</p>

<p>I split my <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/11/">November</a> into days where I’d work on getting better at printmaking (and coming up with stuff like these <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/11/">letterpress business cards</a>) and days where I’d work on the Threadless app. I finally ended up <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/11/28/loves-threadless-iphone-app-launch/">releasing the Threadless app</a> at the end of November. The reception of the app has been great! So far the app has 6 perfect reviews and one 4-star review. That makes me incredibly happy.</p>

<p>This brings us to the current month, <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/12/">December</a>. I started another app engine project that’s not quite ready for public beta yet (though I feel it will be really soon). Because of the app, Threadless was super cool and invited me to their Chicago headquarters. I finally realized one of my lifelong dreams of <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2010/12/27/hung-truong-threadless-model/">becoming a Threadless t-shirt model</a>! I’ve also been hanging out in Albuquerque and spoiling my nephew rotten for a few weeks.</p>

<p>And that is my 2010 year in review. One surprising thing is that many times during 2010, I was really down on myself. But looking back, I actually accomplished some neat stuff! I think it boils down to the fact that there’s still a lot of uncertainty in my life, and that’s hard to manage. But I think I’m getting better at managing it every day. In retrospect, 2010 was a great year, maybe even the best (so far).</p>

<p>Looking at 2011, I see a lot of opportunity. I’m going to continue to remind myself that minor setbacks are just that. I’ll push through them and accomplish even more than I did in 2010! My role model for 2011 is this guy:</p>

<p>Hopefully I’ll have some good stuff to report in a year or so!</p>
