    <p class="meta">February 07, 2011 | <span class="time">3</span> Minute Read</p>
  </header>

  <p>About two weeks ago I updated one of my apps to use AdMob mobile ads when iAd fails to deliver (pretty damn often). Instead of swapping out iAd for AdMob, I use the iAd “didFailToReceiveAdWithError” delegate method to request an AdMob ad when iAd fails. This means that AdMob shouldn’t take any income away from iAd, but only supplement it. I thought I’d take a look at the stats and compare the performance of the two ad networks on my app.</p>

<p>(The following numbers I’m referring to are from the time period from 1/25 to 2/7)</p>

<p>For an idea of scale, my app, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/anime-nano/id385697452?mt=8">Anime Nano</a>, gets about 600 iAd requests per day. My app analytics software (Flurry) is saying I’m getting about 600 sessions per day. The thing is that about 1/5 of those sessions are on the iPad (and I haven’t enabled iAd on the iPad yet), so I think that on average, the iPhone apps are making a little more than one iAd request per session.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/iadstats.png" rel="lightbox[2350]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/iadstats.png?resize=500%2C47" alt="" title="iAd Stats" width="500" height="47" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2352" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/iadstats.png?resize=500%2C47 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/iadstats.png?w=890 890w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Despite the fairly healthy rate of requests that I’m getting, iAds are only getting sent about 15% of the time. This percentage is what’s known as the “fill rate.” This is also what most developers complain about being too low. The clickthrough rate is actually pretty good at 0.81%.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/admobstats.png" rel="lightbox[2350]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/admobstats.png?resize=500%2C42" alt="" title="AdMob Stats" width="500" height="42" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2354" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/admobstats.png?resize=500%2C42 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/admobstats.png?w=948 948w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>When iAd fails to deliver (85% of the time), I fall back to AdMob. The fill rate for AdMob is a high 88%, though the past few days it’s been closer to 99%. The CTR, however, is a fairly low 0.25%, which is less than half of iAd. This is partly due to the fact that AdMob ads refresh more often, so the number of impressions is higher.</p>

<p>I’m going to describe my revenue in terms of percentages here since ad platforms typically don’t like it when publishers publish their income. Not sure if that’s changed lately, but whatever! In the time period from 1/25/2011 to 2/7/2011, I made 2.3x more with iAd than AdMob, even with the super low fill rate (and impressions) of iAd. This is pretty interesting since iAd only shows up 15% of the time. There were actually a few days where AdMob beat iAd, but there were a couple of days where iAd made a killing (relatively), probably from those super awesome interactive ads which I still haven’t experienced firsthand yet.</p>

<p>For now, I’m content with the fill rate of AdMob, though it sort of pains me to see such a low click rate and revenue per click. Something tells me that if AdMob worked harder at increasing ad quality (like iAd), they’d be able to charge more and their advertisers would probably see a better return on investment. Most of the advertisers don’t even bother to use an image ad, which I assume would increase the clickthrough rate.</p>

<p>I noticed something really strange when looking at ads on my app. There’s no way for advertisers to disable ads on devices that already have the app installed. I keep seeing Amazon Kindle ads on both my iPad and my iPhone that already have the application installed. As a developer, I know there’s a way to prevent those ads from showing by detecting whether the app is installed at runtime. I think this strange behavior happens on both iAd and AdMob. If anyone from either organization is reading this, <a href="http://www.hung-truong.com/blog/about/">contact me</a>!</p>

<p>As far as the future of ads in mobile apps goes, I hope Apple will continue working on increasing the fill rate, and that AdMob tries to increase relevancy and ad quality. Right now it’s really frustrating to see my “inventory” not live up to its revenue potential.</p>

    <p>I never only had AdMob only. Just iAd only, so I can’t say what the increase would be. I am pretty confident that there would be an increase moving from just AdMob to iAd-&gt;AdMob, though.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the comparison. Let me share some of my mobile ad network experience as well.
I have published 3 different games on the iOS platform. I recently stopped using AdMob alone as I was seeing eCPMs as low as $0.10 and I am now using a combination of MobFox, iAds and AdMob with the following fallback structure:
1st: MobFox (fills about 60-70% of my EU/US requests with a damn high eCPM)
2nd: iAds (nice eCPM but low fillrate)
3rd: AdMob (will be switching to MobClix for the last fallback option because I heard they have slightly higher eCPCs)
Hope I could help as well!
Best,
Raph</p>

    <p>I am a noob trying to get the best return from my apps. It cost too much to create or even have apps built by others to see such slow return by Admob. I was considering implementing i-Ad into my apps since Apple has been promoting it on their developer’s site. My developer says it’s my choice and did not elaborate. Although, he did mention most people that he builds for use i-Ads because it is promoted so often by Apple. He would not say I would get better financial results.
The ads been generating a small income between $2.5 and $8.00 using Admob advertising. Usually the middle of the week, Friday and Saturday, are the highest amounts received. The app is a free app, Rapid Note (for iPad only). It is my first trial app. I am currently having it updated by adding more functions.
In exactly three weeks of the app being available to users, I have accumulated 75,173 requests, eCPM of $1.75, held a Fill Rate of approx 95.13%, and an RPM of $1.67 (whatever that is).
I just want to say thanks for this information about using the “didFailToReceiveAdWithError” delegate method to request an AdMob ad when iAd fails instead of swapping one for the other. I will forward this on to my developer.</p>

    <p>I have recently switched to AdWril to manage the iAds and AdMob so that if one fails other can take over. In last 15 days I had 11510 request for iAds but 0 impression and 0% fill rate. Out of this 3,191 are from US. 
I will also try out MobFox</p>

    <p>Eric,
It really does depend on what free app you write. The key is user retention once they download your free app. If they don’t use it often and for longer periods of time, they won’t even see the advertisements. iAd has a 3 minute cycle, meaning the user has to be using your free app for longer than 3 minutes in order to see more than 1 impression. So gimmicks are useless. As for revenue trade secrets, it depends on what the advertisers pay you to show it and click it. But I can say from experience, you need a huge following in order to make a bit of daily change. 100,000 retained users may get you between $20 to $60 per day. These are what I have heard around but I cannot confirm. My experience has been slow, it’s been 3 days with iAd only (to be changed in the next version) and I have seen a nice increase in user base and it certainly isn’t 100,000 users yet for GeoTasker Lite (http://alturl.com/e3xxb) but I am happy with any uptick in revenue for now.</p>

    <p>Here are my stats so far for my free ad supported app as of 6 Sept. 2011 (1 month of usage for ads and I only use iAd and AdMob via Adwhirl):
9,500 downloads so far.
Median session length – 6.1 minutes
Average Fill Rate for iAd 79%
Average Fill Rate for AdMob 72.6%
Average eCPM:
  AdMob – .08
  iAd   – 1.19
As you can see, there is a HUGE difference in the eCPM!
Based on my results, I now only use AdMob as a fallback when I fail to receive an iAd because a few pennies is better than no pennies.
Translating clicks to cash:
 AdMob –
    Highest – .051 per click
    Lowest  – .023 per click
 iAd
    Highest – .617 per click
    Lowest  – .255 per click
In the last week my average income for iAds has been $12 a day and AdMob 50 cents a day.
I have been getting an average 100 new downloads a day.</p>

    <p>Just a small update.
iAd is now averaging between $15-$20 a day and AdMob is down to 15-25 cents a day.
I think I might just go iAd all the way and not have AdMob at all.
I’ll lose very little money and user’s won’t have to see as many ads, which (I hope) will make them happier and click the iAds even more!</p>

    <p>Hello
I am starting in this world of mobile network applications and I have many doubts:
MobFox claims to have the highest cCPM.  What is your experience?
How could one appl use MobFox and in case there is no fill, fallback to AdWhirl?
Which ad network do you recommend?  why?
Thanks for sharing your experience.
