  <p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Facebook-Troll-Poll.png" rel="lightbox[2242]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Facebook-Troll-Poll.png?resize=500%2C201" alt="" title="Facebook Troll Poll" width="500" height="201" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2243" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Facebook-Troll-Poll.png?resize=500%2C201 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Facebook-Troll-Poll.png?w=741 741w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>I saw a Facebook Poll late last night that a friend had voted on. The question was something like “Which pair of shoes should I get?” The poll had twitpic.com links as answers, so the idea was that people look at the pics and let the guy decide which pair of shoes was better.</p>

<p>Apparently in Facebook Polls, you click on the answer to vote. And there’s no unvote (you can vote for another choice, but you can’t abstain after clicking). So people ended up clicking on the twitpic link thinking they’d see the image, and ended up accidentally voting on the poll. I fell for this, too. There were something like a couple thousand answers on that poll. I believe it’s been removed now.</p>

<p>I figured I could do better with a more salient question, so I made one up myself. “Which pair of glasses look better on me?” I made the question have two twitpic links, which you can view <a href="http://twitpic.com/3thlqp">here</a> and <a href="http://twitpic.com/3thlp4">here</a> if you actually copy and paste them in. I figured people are naturally judgers, and something like helping someone choose glasses to wear is an easy task (plus you theoretically get to see pictures of faces, which people just love, consciously or subconsciously).</p>

<p>I started the poll late last night, which probably didn’t help, but a few friends took the bait. I hope they forgive me as I did this for <del datetime="2011-01-27T00:03:04+00:00">science</del> the lulz! When I woke up this morning, there were currently 51 votes, from people I know, friends of friends, and even people two degrees out of my social network! I think it would be really interesting to see how this poll spreads through Facebook (assuming they don’t shut it down first).</p>

<p>I guess now that this post is published, any scientific value is gone (since you could be reading from anywhere and vote for my poll non-virally). The main point is that when you design systems very rigidly (in Facebook’s case, not letting people abstain from a poll, which believe it or not is a valid bit of information), interesting consequences pop up.</p>

<p>I’ll keep checking the status of the poll and see if it actually blows up, whimpers and dies or gets taken down quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I think another reason that this poll is so effective is that it makes it seem that the person who voted is the originator of the poll. Check out the newsfeed formatting:</p>

<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Troll-Poll-Newsfeed.png" rel="lightbox[2242]"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Troll-Poll-Newsfeed.png?resize=500%2C136" alt="" title="Troll-Poll-Newsfeed" width="500" height="136" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2253" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Troll-Poll-Newsfeed.png?resize=500%2C136 500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Troll-Poll-Newsfeed.png?w=511 511w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The voter’s name is prominently displayed (though I blurred it) and the person who asked the question is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: The time is now about 12:40PM and the total number of voters has doubled to 99!</p>

<p><strong>Edit #2</strong>: It’s about 1:10PM and the number has doubled again to 201!</p>

<p><strong>Edit #3</strong>: The time is around 1:24PM and there’s 304 answers.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #4</strong>: Alright, it’s 1:35PM and there’s 406 votes.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #5</strong>: Wow. It’s 1:41PM and there’s 502 votes.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #5</strong>: It’s 1:48 and there are 621 votes.</p>

    <p>mad facebooker, why are you so mad? Did you fall for it too? This is a simple analysis of an interface. If no such analyses were done, the internet would be a chaotic place full of terrible interfaces. Intelligent people find this sort of thing interesting. I know that you yourself are probably just trolling, but profanity makes you appear quite dim.</p>

    <p>As someone who actually does research on phenomena occurring in networked data sets, I have to tell you you’re wrong.
This really is an interesting phenomenon:  It’s basically an infectious disease sweeping through a contact network where not everyone is susceptible.
While it would be extremely useful to see facebook’s logs of how this actually propagated, even looking at the growth rate is fairly interesting.</p>

    <p>This isn’t an analysis. Nor is it science. There was no thesis, no goal, no outcome-dependent statement. This action could have been called “baking” or “mountain climbing” and have just as accurate a title as “conducting science.” The proper title for this is “quality assurance.” You’ve tested a website and let the programmers know about a particular shortcoming. Don’t go seeking out the Nobel prize, dude.</p>

    <p>I don’t see the awesomeness for me or most other people. I understand how it’s awesome for you — you created something simple and it spread around virally. Pat yourself on the back. That’s great. For you. For the rest of us it’s really just “meh.”
I wasn’t “butthurt” over the word science. I was just saddened that a grown man—a college graduate—had no clue what science is and was able to confuse it for quality assurance of a web product.</p>

    <p>you can simply go to your own profile after either clicking knowingly or falling for this to remove the “update” from your own page – and thereby preventing yourself from propagating the spam. 
Personally, I wish facebook prompted to ask if you wanted this added to your feed, but there are a lot of things I wish they would do differently as well…</p>

    <p>Their frontend is pretty, but their backend stuff has never worked correctly.  Their photo app doesn’t display about 5-10% of the time, searching messages has seemingly never worked, their chat app is terrible, just to name a few.  There are plenty of somewhat annoying UI features, for example that one seemingly cannot set it to the “real-time” newsfeed permanently instead of using some algorithm they’ve decided is the best way to display your newsfeed.</p>

If clicking actually casted your vote, most people would click #1 first…who decided to check out #2 first!?</p>

    <p>So I didn’t fall for it and here’s why: when it appeared in my news feed that several of my friends had taken it, I got suspicious because the friends it listed definitely do not know each other and it would be a crazy coincidence if they had a mutual friend asking the question.  There were a few from my high school, a girl I went to college with, and someone I know from grad school in a completely different part of the country.  I can see, however, how this could work for people with a more limited friends list or for whom that thought wouldn’t have immediately occured to them.  My boyfriend specializes in UI, so he’ll be very interested to hear about this experiment.  I generally hate fb spam, but I support this for the sake of science. bravo!</p>

    <p>um, no it’s not “science” since science does not force people to engage in something unwittingly. Further, since you don’t allow people to remove or opt out of the situation, you’re not actually allowing them autonomy and spamming facebook. Nice work, asshole.</p>

    <p>misanthropicanthropologist: Define “force”. I do not think anyone had you at gunpoint and made you click on a link to see someone in glasses. You fell for a terrible FB interface. No force needed.
Science is exploring new things and trying to find new phenomenon.
Also, Hung is not the one how doesn’t allow you to opt out, facebook doesn’t allow you to. This is an experiment illustrating poor UI. I am also a User Interface Engineer (as are all those who seem to “get” this!).</p>

    <p>Actually, there are plenty of decent usability tools out there. There’s a whole segment of research called anthropology + design — something that most UI people are too egocentric to explore. 
You’re correct I was not “forced” to click, but I was trying to see something my friend posted. As Hung, who apparently does not yet know that the word you has three letters and not one, has gloated, the application tricks you into thinking that your friend (a person whom I’ve selected as a person I trust and want to be part of my social network) posted the link. This is untrue and disingenuous.
You’re correct that FB has shitty UI. We can completely agree with it — and certainly this is just a small example of FB’s complete disregard to user-centered controls. I spend time actually deleting things from my wall, not clicking most inane shit that’s thrown up on FB, and using adblocker to avoid seeing incoherent ads. But that doesn’t mean that Hung’s “experiment” was terribly experimental. There is actually a difference between deceit and scientific experiment.
What I’m mad about is not a stupid little link that I “fell for,” but rather Hung’s seeming pride in his ability to program. Nice work, hot shot. Being a programmer is not a fucking ninja skill — at least not on this base level. 
Science + social sciences do explore “new phenomena” but there are plenty of ways to do that in more sophisticated and thoughtful ways. Plenty of experiments (Tuskgee, etc.) were done on people who had no say, and most scientific ethics boards would discredit such methods.
So, dear “UI who gets it,” please do a little reading and think a little harder about all the embedded tools to “track” users’ behaviors, etc. Most market research informs its users/participants that they are participating in an experiment. Whether they know exactly what element is the experimental one is less crucial than providing them information with what they’re participating in.
On these terms, Hung fails.</p>

    <p>I noticed that, too. I think it probably has to do with the fact that for each person, you’re not exposing it to that many new people. A lot of people are those who were already “exposed” to it. So it’s not exponential outright, but it is growing, probably as people become more susceptible to it when more of their friends vote.</p>

Turns out Facebook did it wrong. Good science, it’s like finding a hole in the fabric of society or something where all these ppl expect everything on FB to work as they expect and then when it doesn’t they get mad.

    <p>Can I say something though? You can delete this after you read it, I just had to say it to someone.Totally unrelated but not. You/me/yr friends are well versed in the verbage that’s associated with a certain site that begins with a number and ends with an an, yes? Up until a few weeks ago I was a bemused viewer of content on that site, particularly the sub-section that begins with a letter that is not a or any of the letters including or after c. So, last time I was there someone posted a whole thread of pics that can only be described as horrible criminal abuse footage involving BABIES, like under a year old and very small children, not teens but toddlers, being abused. It’s caused me no end of anguish and  sadness to know that it is real and such sick people have done such sick things and it’s not a funny joke like CP CP Mods are asleep. It’s so so sad. Don’t know why I am posting this here except to say that that site is ruined for me now and I don’t think I can ever look there again. And I am not very sensitized uptight person. At all.  Too bad because it is funny to read someone making comments like U MAD? and know where it comes from.</p>

    <p>Even for science it does not make sense to cheat and make people do something they do not intend to do. Also, it does not make sense for you to not allow them to undo their option. I feel somebody stole my right to decide about it, I do not understand how you could even create something similar if you somebody did this to you too. I guess you have a different way of reasoning. It worries me that you have this logic. If somebody do something bad to you, you do not want to do this to other people you have to try to stop it. Am I right?

    <p>I won’t try to convince you you’re wrong. You are entitled to a different opinion. I just wanted to see if I could replicate what I saw, and perhaps make it more viral. If anything else it proves a point that Facebook’s current way of doing polls is kinda wacky.
Do you think it would have been more effective for me to email Facebook about it? Do you think they know about it now? Do you think they’re working on a fix for it now?
I only mentioned the science thing to be tongue in cheek, really. This was more of an experiment to see what happened. I think it’s also good that I made the thing pretty inert (no spam, no spyware or anything, just a little time wasted).</p>

    <p>fyi I know for a fact its being circulated through actual fb employees as the friend I clicked on it from works there. I also will say that they probably don’t care about your experiment at all..
also, your site is just as stuipd as it puts unchecked links tagged to anonymous usernames.. :rolleyes:</p>

    <p>I think that if the only point was to try to prove Facebook polls are wacky you did not need to involve all these people. We are all wasting time and having different reactions (mostly negative ones) to an unexpected result. The fact that the poll way did not allow to undo an action is not a problem for us (at least if the options were clear we decided to vote and could have asked FB if we still wanted to undo the action) There is a problem now when somebody post in our wall or if FB tell our friends that we did something we did not intended to do. We feel that somebody cheated on us and it is a not a good feeling. I do not like to create that feeling in other people because I know how it feels. Thanks god I met people in my life that made me understand that I can not have fun at the cost of other people sadness/embarrassment. I just want to make sure people are getting this message. It might not be understood right now but at least I want to try to get the message to them. It worth a lot if at least one prank is avoided because of it. Thanks.</p>

    <p>Augh… Johanna, he’s not trying to trick people just because he thinks it’s funny – he’s illustrating how a design flaw can be unintentionally self-perpetuating.
This is a FB poll that you accidentally voted on. It doesn’t matter. In the general scope of things, literally every other thing you’ve done today should be more important than that.</p>

    <p>Honestly, Johanna, People who get made about “time wasting things’ while on facebook, irritate the hell out of me. Your’re on facebook, scrolling through your news feed, and looking at pictures. you are already wasting time. As for voting, Its a click. 3 seconds to read the question, and a half second more to move the mouse and vote. it wasnt that big of a time waster now, was it?</p>

    <p>So yeah, I saw this poll on my feed just now. I was perplexed at how the friends that voted appeared to be completely unrelated, but nevertheless I assumed that a friend of mine made the poll.
The reason I didn’t get trolled was I tried to right click and open the links in a new tab, and I couldn’t do that. So that made me go to the polling page and copypaste from the “<strong>__ voted for __</strong>” headlines.
But yes, very scientific indeed. I applaud you.</p>

    <p>You know, Facebook actually might not think all this “trolling” is bad.  If anything, it’s brought attention and engagement to a feature that was previously not as well publicized.  I certainly didn’t know you could create a clickable poll that would show up in my friends’ newsfeeds.</p>

    <p>Also part of the misleading UI is intentional on FB’s part, highlighting the part where “yourFriend voted on…” and leaving out the original author is a way of increasing engagement and is used in most of the responsive ads on FB(and some of the more spam-y aps: “yourFriend answered a question about you…” “yourFriend liked X, click Like to see X”)
If nothing else, FB can point this out to advertisers, “Look how easy it is to get 50,000 page views, sre you sure you don’t want to upgrade from a sidebar ad?”</p>

Extra credit science/lulz: graph of how many people swore at you vs. congratulated you over the course of the experiment.

    <p>Another UX/HCI fail for FB. They have a few. Check this minor one out: http://blog.hectorparra.com/post/1369653700/a-simple-ux-fail-facebook-can-fix-right-away
I, like many here, fell for this and truly LOL’d when I actually visited the URLs. Like your edit mentioned, I initially thought a friend created this poll. If anyone is creating spam, it’s Facebook, by making me think such a thing.
In terms of human subjects, you participated in deceit. I doubt you’re going to publish this result, but I think you can spin it anyway using FBs own TOS. We sign all are rights away the second we login. We might as well volunteer for experimental surgery. HGP</p>

    <p>Hahaha, great job! I saw all my friends voting on it. I was going to click the links, but decided it looked suspicious (because in clicking would i be voting?) so I went to your fb page instead. And was like what? I don’t know this guy OR have any friends in common with him. Then I saw the link and had to see what was going on (plus I was curious to see which pair of glasses looked better on you… hahaha). I suppose all this could have been avoided had people been smart facebook users and looked at who asked the question/poll first?</p>

    <p>This is just fun!
I love that you found a way to exploit Facebook’s relentless efforts at information gathering! It’s also an interesting social commentary that so many people are taking the bait.

    <p>Someone mentioned that it’s immoral or whatever to not tell someone that they are part of a research experiment. 
I’m not sure of the morality of it, but every person who uses virtually any commercial website—Apple.com, ebay, Amazon, as well as hundreds of thousands of marketing-minded sites—participates in unwitting, über-scientfic, marketing and usage research CONSTANTLY. 
This stuff is not a game, it’s a science. Contemplate what Google ALONE knows about what we do online, given that Google Analytics is the de facto (free) software installed on millions of websites around the world, and that they track by IP address. The data gathered is invaluable to anyone who does business online.
I say, no harm no foul. Very interesting trends, regardless of the accuracy of your data. 
Makes me wonder if FB wasn’t just testing a new UI in the same way I would split-test advertising placement on a web page, or split-test an email subject line for open and click-through rates. 
You have found a very interesting behavior pattern and a significant impetus to repeat this experiment. This time, with more scientific principles involved.</p>
