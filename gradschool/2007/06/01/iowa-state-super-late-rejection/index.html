On behalf of Jim Oliver, HCI graduate program chair, thank you very much for your application to our graduate program. We are very pleased to be able to consider students such as you. However, we only accept students for whom we can provide research assistantships. Unfortunately, we receive applications from many more highly qualified students than we are able to support." />

<p>On behalf of Jim Oliver, HCI graduate program chair, thank you very much for your application to our graduate program. We are very pleased to be able to consider students such as you. However, we only accept students for whom we can provide research assistantships. Unfortunately, we receive applications from many more highly qualified students than we are able to support. We, therefore, cannot offer you admission.</p>
<p>I trust that you will be admitted elsewhere and wish you the best of luck in your graduate studies. Thank you again for considering Iowa State University.</p>

<p>I already accepted over at Michigan, so this is kind of pointless to post. Except that it’s way funny seeing this email in June. Ah well.</p>
