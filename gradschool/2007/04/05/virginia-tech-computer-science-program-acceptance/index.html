<meta name="description" content="I got a letter in the mail today from Virginia Tech. Surprisingly, it was an acceptance letter! I got into their CS program! Pretty cool. The letter came fairly late, though, and without any mention of scholarships, so I’m assuming I’m one of their second or third tier choices.
I’ve already accepted to go to Michigan (with a nice funding package), but it’s nice to see that I made it into another program at least." />

        <p>I got a letter in the mail today from Virginia Tech. Surprisingly, it was an acceptance letter! I got into their CS program! Pretty cool. The letter came fairly late, though, and without any mention of scholarships, so I’m assuming I’m one of their second or third tier choices.</p>
<p>I’ve already accepted to go to Michigan (with a nice funding package), but it’s nice to see that I made it into another program at least. I think the program at Virginia Tech is actually pretty competitive, so it makes me feel better about being rejected from <a href="https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2007/03/05/university-of-california-berkeley-ischool-rejection/">Berkeley</a> and <a href="https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2007/03/28/georgia-tech-hci-program-rejection/">Georgia Tech</a>.</p>
<p>My record is now 2 of 6, with 2 being rejections and 2 not yet known. Like I said though, it doesn’t really matter since I got into my top school, but pride-wise, this makes me happy.</p>
