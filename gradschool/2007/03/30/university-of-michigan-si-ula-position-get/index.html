<meta name="description" content="I just got a call from Lisa Gray-Lion regarding the status of my University Library Associates application. I think I said “yes” before she even officially asked me to accept!
I’ll still have to fill out some paperwork, but I think it’s safe to announce this. The associates position pretty much relieves all the worries I had about getting financial support to go to grad school. I was looking at the University of Michigan entry on Wikipedia last night, and I learned that it’s the most expensive public school in the country for out of state students!" />

        <p>I just got a call from Lisa Gray-Lion regarding the status of my <a href="https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2007/03/11/university-of-michigan-library-associate-phone-interview/">University Library Associates application</a>. I think I said “yes” before she even officially asked me to accept!</p>
<p>I’ll still have to fill out some paperwork, but I think it’s safe to announce this. The associates position pretty much relieves all the worries I had about getting financial support to go to grad school. I was looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan entry</a> on Wikipedia last night, and I learned that it’s the most expensive public school in the country for out of state students!</p>
<p>Because I don’t have to worry about finances anymore, I can safely say that I’ll be going to the University of Michigan in the Fall. I guess I should send in that letter, just to make it super official.</p>
<p>I’m seriously excited about this. Because I’m not a typical librarian student, my job description will be more experimental and fun. Hopefully I can come up with a lot of good ideas on how to enhance the library with emerging technologies and the paradigms behind them.</p>
<p>PS: I just ordered <a href="https://www.nike.com/index.jhtml#l=nikestore,grid,_pdp,cid-1/gid-114990/pid-114990,_grid,f-10002+12002+4294967258&amp;re=US&amp;co=US&amp;la=EN">this</a>.</p>
