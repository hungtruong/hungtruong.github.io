<p>The visiting days include an optional tour of the campus, housing, or libraries, and then a few activities with some of the student groups. It seems like fun, and I’d really like to be able to visit a school before committing to going there.</p>
<p>Hopefully everything will work out and I’ll be able to visit on the scheduled day. I’m actually going to be out of town on the day before, so I’d have to fly directly to Michigan. I can probably make it work, though.</p>
