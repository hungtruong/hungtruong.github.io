I finally got a response! A rejection! Yeah, that’s right, Georgia Tech only takes the time to respond to a candidate when they’re rejecting them. How nice. Here’s the letter:
Dear Hung:
I’m sorry to inform you that your application to Georgia Tech’s MS program in Human-Computer Interaction has been declined." />

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Hung:</p>
<p>I’m sorry to inform you that your application to Georgia Tech’s MS program in Human-Computer Interaction has been declined.</p>
<p>There are many applicants we are not able to admit. The applicant pool was significantly larger than in recent years, and the overall quality of applicants even higher than usual.</p>
<p>If you would like advice on strengthening your application and trying again next year, I’ll be happy to help.</p>
<p>You have our best wishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least they offered to give me advice on helping my application. I actually emailed them back immediately and got an “out of town” autoreply. So they wrote me this denial from out of town?</p>
<p>I’m not too upset about this. Georgia Tech showed that they didn’t care about their MS students even before sending me this rejection. I spoke with some other students at the University of Michigan visiting days and there was pretty much a consensus that Georgia Tech treats their MS students with dollar signs in their eyes.</p>
