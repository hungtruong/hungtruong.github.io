        <p>Today I received a letter of acceptance from the University of Michigan School of Information. It was one of my top choices, so I’m happy to be accepted for admission. Actually, right now it’s a “conditional” admission, since they said they’re having issues with my official transcript, but I’m sure that won’t be a problem.</p>
<p>I still haven’t heard anything about possible financial aid or scholarships yet. Hopefully I’ll be offered something. I think it would be very hard for me to go to school for more than $14,000 a semester without any assistance. Maybe I’ll receive that information at a later date. Edit: I got an email saying that the financial aid offers will be given in March.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m very happy about getting the email. I hope the other schools will send their Acceptance/Rejection (I hope not!) letters soon. One thing I found interesting was that Michigan sent me the acceptance letter by email. I think almost all schools will only send this information out by snail mail. Not that it’s bad or anything, I’d rather find out as soon as possible! It’s pretty cool that Michigan is hip enough with technology to use email though.</p>
