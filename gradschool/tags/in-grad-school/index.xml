      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, guess what? This version of WordPress is really old, I haven’t updated this blog in forever, and I graduated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep this thing around because I think many people have used it as a resource. Also, who knows if I might someday try for a PhD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, have a great summer, stay cool, K.I.T. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just hardly post on this blog anymore. But I do post on my personal blog. It just sorta makes more sense that way, since it usually has a higher readership on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hung-truong.com/blog/2008/01/06/internship-searching-season-2008/&#34;&gt;thoughts on the current internship hunt that I’m facing&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it might be useful for people who have already gotten into grad school, and who are looking for a good internship for the Summer. I don’t have a complete list of internships for social computing-minded people, but I have a start…&lt;/p&gt;
