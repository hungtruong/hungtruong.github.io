      <title>Official GRE Scores Breakdown!</title>
      <link>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2007/01/16/official-gre-scores-breakdown/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got my official GRE scores back. They were the same as the “unofficial” ones that I got right after I took the test. For the verbal, I got a 590 which was in the 83 percentile. I got a 710 for the quantitative which is in the 73 percentile. For my analytical writing score I got a 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty happy with the score that I got for the verbal part of the test. The “Interpreting Your GRE Scores” document that they sent along with the scores stated that the mean for this score in Engineering is 468. Even in the Humanities the mean is 545, so I guess I did pretty good for an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quantitative score I got, 710, is right about par with the Engineering mean of 719. I actually thought I had bombed this section since I basically ran out of time and guessed a whole bunch. I got really good scores in the practice tests, but I guess I was just really nervous for the test. Hopefully the 710 is good enough for the schools I’m applying to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analytical writing score of 4.5 is also fairly average. The mean for engineers is 4.2. They only give the scores in .5 increments, though. I thought I had done a better job of writing, myself. I tried putting good arguments and whatnot into my essays. Oh well, I guess 4.5 is really nothing to be upset about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I thought the GRE was one of the most stressful things I’ve had to endure. The score you earn in the GRE is definitely a quantitative indicator that schools look at. Having said that, I’m still really skeptical as to how useful it really is. It feels to me like something you need to take for the sake of taking it (and paying $130). I really do hope that I’ll never have to take another GRE in my life again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GRE Practice Test Roundup</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took the GRE a little more than a week ago. While I want to hold off on writing about it until I see my final scores, I will say that it’s really important to prepare for the GRE before taking it. The best way to do this is to take practice tests. The best ones are those that tell you not only which questions you got incorrect, but why you missed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through a lot of these practice tests before taking the real GRE. I really think they do make a difference, especially when it comes to feeling comfortable while taking the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d make a list of practice tests that you can use to study for the GRE, since I found them useful myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.princetonreview.com/grad/testprep/testprep.asp?TPRPAGE=80&amp;amp;TYPE=GRE-PRACTICE-TEST&#34;&gt;The Princeton Review&lt;/a&gt; – This is a simple web based practice GRE, and the first one I took. It’s free to take as long as you do a quick registration with the Princeton Review. This practice test tells you how long you took on each question and gives you feedback on each answer (and why each wrong answer is incorrect).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ntis01.ets.org/onyx/powerprepTestTakers.htm&#34;&gt;GRE Powerprep Software&lt;/a&gt; – This software is similar to the Princeton Review, and both are very similar to the actual GRE. This software is free with registration, and includes two tests and some focused practice sections. I found the focused sections to be very useful in preparing for the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/GRE/pdf/gre%20practice%20general%20test.pdf&#34;&gt;GRE Practice General Test&lt;/a&gt; -This isn’t a computer practice test, but a paper one. It’s a sample of the test you would take if you were to do the non computer one. What’s useful with this is it includes a few samples of the writing test, along with some critiques and suggestions on how to make the analytical section better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NR67I?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=b00003ph0-20&amp;amp;Code=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0009NR67I&#34;&gt;Kaplan GMAT/GRE/LSAT 2006 Platinum&lt;/a&gt; – While this software isn’t free, it really does help a lot. The Kaplan software includes practice tests and tutorials on how to answer questions, even if you don’t know the answer. While this is useful, it really makes the GRE feel like more of a test on how well you can take tests, and not on general knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any resources that I’ve missed? If so, please let me know in the comments and I’ll update the post if I find that they’re useful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Last GRE Practice Test</title>
      <link>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/12/26/last-gre-practice-test/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/12/26/last-gre-practice-test/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished the last (probably) GRE practice test before I take the real one on Wednesday. This was the second test of the Powerprep software test. I got a 540 on the verbal part and a 760 on the quantitative section. I’m pretty happy with the score of 760, which is up quite a bit from my first practice test of 630. I actually think it was lower the first time I took it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not too worried about the verbal, since I have a feeling I’ll do really well on the written part of the exam. My statement of purpose and personal statement should also prove that I have the verbal skills necessary for grad school work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully my scores will reach all of the universities in time. I’d hate to be taking the GRE for nothing…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GRE Delays and Drama</title>
      <link>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/12/20/gre-delays-and-drama/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/12/20/gre-delays-and-drama/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to take the general GRE test this morning. Since I would get most of the scores right after the test, and the site said that it would take 10-15 days to send the scores, I thought I would make it in time for all of my applications. It snowed really really hard (at least, for New Mexico) yesterday, so they canceled my test! I had to reschedule for December 27th… I’m not sure if the scores will even make it on time for a few of my schools, now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll go ahead and still apply to all of my schools anyway. I’ll be able to write the GRE scores on the applications. It’s just that the schools might not get the official scores until after the official deadline. I’m not sure how stingy some of these schools are, but I’d like to think they they wouldn’t throw an application outright only because the official GRE scores didn’t make it on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that I’ll have more time to study. I took the “Powerprep” practice GRE test, and I got a fairly high verbal (which I don’t remember, because I retook the verbal part again) and a 700 on the quantitative, which is decent. I was worried because the quantitative questions looked a lot different compared to the previous practice tests that I had taken. Apparently it didn’t make too much of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that my scores might reach their destination late. And the test was rescheduled for 8am, when my original was at 12 noon. I’m not a morning person, so hopefully I’ll get enough rest for the GRE when I take it in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More GRE Practice</title>
      <link>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/11/19/more-gre-practice/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2006 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/11/19/more-gre-practice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I took that same practice GRE test a few times yesterday. Unfortunately, it looks like I’m getting duplicate questions, so the accuracy of the scores is probably not as good. I got 690 on both verbal and quantitative this time. I wonder why I keep getting the same on both parts…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time through the math part, I actually ran out of time. This is because I took a more leisurely pace and suddenly the questions got more demanding. I suppose it’s because the test adapts itself to you. So if you answer a lot of questions wrong in the beginning, it’ll throw some easier ones at you. If you answer them correctly, the questions get harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually got a lot of new questions in the verbal part. It seems like I answered those correctly too, so hopefully it’ll be the same way in the real test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll try looking for another practice test with different questions so I can make sure that I don’t come into the test overconfident. I’d really like to not run out of time on the test. Also, I’ve haven’t really practiced the written part of the test, but I have been writing a lot in this (and other) blogs, which will probably help quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Random Application Tips</title>
      <link>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/11/15/random-application-tips/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2006 22:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/11/15/random-application-tips/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I talked to another past professor of mine today because I had heard he knows a lot about applying to grad school. He wouldn’t admit mastery of the subject, but he did say that he probably knows a hell of a lot more than I do about it right now. That fact is incontestable. Anyway, he gave me some tips that I hadn’t heard yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, he went through the process of how he looks at grad school applications at our own school. Apparently, some aid goes through and writes a summary of the entire application which goes in the front. Next he flips through the transcripts without much emphasis. He reminds me that there are hundreds of these things to read through. At a place like Stanford we’d be talking somewhere around 5,000…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next he looks at the statement of purpose. This is one of the more important parts, since it shows that the applicant has a clear goal, and that the applicant can write well. He tells me there should be a beginning, middle, and end, much like a story. He also told me that the statement of purpose should make people at the program say “hey, this guy is cool, we should get him in here!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he goes through the letters of recommendation. These are the closest thing to a third party that he has to make a decision on the applicant. They should really say things like “I worked with so and so on this and that, and he really impressed me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn’t take the time to build the kinds of relationships to warrant those kinds of letters. The software engineering professor that I’m working with right now will be able to write something closer to that, but not this professor. All he can really say is that I was a fairly good student and that I was more willing to go up to the chalkboard than others in the same class. Though it’s not a tier 1 type of letter, I’ll still ask him since I do recall doing well in the class, and the professor is honest when he tells me he can’t write a stellar letter. At the very least, it won’t hurt (like a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Man&#34;&gt;Dr. Bledsoe letter&lt;/a&gt; would).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we talked about the schools that I’m applying to. Apparently my undergraduate adviser went to Georgia Tech, so I should talk to him about faculty there. Apparently it helps to have a faculty at the school who would be familiar with me, so when my application pops up, they might push it harder. I’ll definitely try contacting some faculty, once I’ve turned in my applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing For The GRE With Practice Tests</title>
      <link>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/11/08/preparing-for-the-gre-with-practice-tests/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2006 21:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/11/08/preparing-for-the-gre-with-practice-tests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that will hopefully help in my grad school admissions are my standardized test scores. I remember getting a decent SAT score, and I never even took the ACT. Luckily, I still got into my school of choice, UNM. Well, it was my only choice, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard people say that the GRE really did a number on them. They went in unprepared and suffered the consequences. While a high GRE score probably won’t guarantee that I’ll get accepted into the more difficult universities, it definitely won’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went ahead and tried the practice test over at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://princetonreview.com/&#34;&gt;Princeton Review&lt;/a&gt;. The first time I tried it, I was fairly distracted and I was going fast to see how long it would take. I ended up taking about 2/3 of the time for both parts. I skipped the writing parts, since they wouldn’t get graded anyway unless I paid for it. I got a pretty bad score the first time. I don’t remember what I got though, since I deleted it and tried again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the test questions are somewhat randomized. I only got two or so duplicates. The second time through, I took more time and tried being more careful. I still missed a few questions. The cool thing about the practice tests is that you can see exactly what you missed and get an explanation of why you missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final scores on the second test run were 630 for both the verbal and quantitative sections. While that’s great for the verbal score, as an Engineering major, my quantitative score needs to be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the questions I missed, they were a mix of careless mistakes and lack of trigonometry/probability knowledge. I guess it’s not really a lack so much as a need to brush up. I haven’t done any math involving trig or probability in a really long time. Since I know what I need to work on, I should be able to raise my scores before I take the real test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t taken the GRE and haven’t done any preparation, I’d suggest at least trying out the practice test over at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://princetonreview.com/&#34;&gt;Princeton Review&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know how close it is to the real GRE, but at least I’m feeling more confident about my strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
