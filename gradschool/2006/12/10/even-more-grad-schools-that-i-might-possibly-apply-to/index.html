Carnegie Mellon üîóDegree: Master‚Äôs in HCI
Deadline: January 31st, 2007
Notes: Carnegie Mellon is one of the more highly ranked and prestigious schools out there. Their HCI program is different from many others because it only takes a year to finish. The program runs from Fall of a given year to the Summer of the next." />

        <p>Reader demaws commented on my <a href="https://www.hung-truong.com/gradschool/2006/11/14/my-application-list-for-computer-science-and-related-schools/">Application List</a> with a few other schools. I figured I should take a quick look at them to see if they‚Äôre application worthy:</p>
<h2 id="carnegie-mellon">Carnegie Mellon <a href="#carnegie-mellon" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Degree: <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Master‚Äôs in HCI</a></p>
<p>Deadline: January 31st, 2007</p>
<p>Notes: Carnegie Mellon is one of the more highly ranked and prestigious schools out there. Their HCI program is different from many others because it only takes a year to finish. The program runs from Fall of a given year to the Summer of the next. The website states that the program does not financially support its students, but occasionally a teaching assistantship will come up for students with a CS background.</p>
<p>It looks like there would really be no time to do research while taking so many courses in one semester, on top of doing a teaching assistantship! There is a part time option, so I could probably apply with that in mind.</p>
<h2 id="iowa-state-university">Iowa State University <a href="#iowa-state-university" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Degree: <a href="https://www.hci.iastate.edu/description.php">Master‚Äôs in Human Computer Interaction</a></p>
<p>Deadline: January 1st, 2007</p>
<p>Notes: Apparently, the HCI program at Iowa State is very highly ranked. I took a look at their website. It looks like they have some interesting courses. For example, ‚ÄúInteraction Methods for Emerging Technologies‚Äù and ‚ÄúOrganizational and Social Implications of Human Computer Interaction.‚Äù Also noteworthy is that that ‚ÄúAll students accepted into the HCI program will receive a half-time graduate assistantship.‚Äù I‚Äôm not really sure what that means. I guess that all students can go part time fully paid. I‚Äôll have to email and ask though.</p>
<p>Also, it seems that they have a pre-application before the actual application. Luckily, the pre application is free, so I‚Äôll probably be taking advantage of that fact.</p>
<h2 id="university-of-maryland">University of Maryland <a href="#university-of-maryland" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Degree: Master‚Äôs in Computer Science, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/">HCI Group</a><br>
Deadline: December 15th, 2006</p>
<p>Notes: Maryland has a Human Computer Interaction research group, but no actual department. Therefore, I‚Äôd have to apply to CS and then do research within the HCI group. Their group certainly looks like a lively bunch of people. Unfortunately, the deadline is in‚Ä¶ 5 days. So I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be applying due to time constraints.</p>
<h2 id="stanford">Stanford <a href="#stanford" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Degree: MS in Computer Science, <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/">HCI Group</a><br>
Deadline: December 12th, 2006</p>
<p>Notes: Stanford has a pretty rockin‚Äô HCI group too, it seems. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs Stanford, and I‚Äôm not a perfect robot. Also, the deadline is in two days, which is kind of cutting it close‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd apply if I thought I had a chance, and if I could turn back time (which would probably look good in my resume).</p>
