        <p>Last post, I mentioned that the University of Michigan had a nice <a href="https://mblog.lib.umich.edu/sitrenches1/">admissions blog</a> that included a contact email in case any prospective students had questions. I actually had a few questions, so I decided to send an email. I also figured that I should send emails to all of the institutions that I was thinking of applying to. I sent similar emails (though they each had specific questions about each program) to Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, UC Irvine, and Berkeley.</p>
<p>I received a very long and thoughtful response from Laura Elgas at Michigan. Her email really went above and beyond what I was expecting to receive. She answered all of my questions and even offered to set up a telephone appointment so I could speak with her directly! Suffice it to say, I have a very positive impression of the program at Michigan now. It really means a lot to me that a real human would reply and help me out with this difficult process.</p>
<p>I also got a personal reply from Virginia Tech. They simply stated that I seemed to be a good match with their program based on the info I told them (I also sent them the URL for <a href="https://www.notecentric.com/">Notecentric</a>). Most of my questions were answered, though they skipped a few. They politely asked that I keep in touch once I’ve actually submitted my application. This is about on par with what I would expect to receive. I understand that most schools don’t have much time to respond personally to emails, so the reply I got very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Both UC Irvine and Berkeley sent me automatic replies. The UC Irvine one had a lot of general grad school information. It said that I should send the message again if my questions weren’t answered. I did. The Berkeley email just stated that I should be receiving a reply shortly. This was five days ago. Hopefully I’ll get something from both of them soon.</p>
<p>Georgia Tech sent me nothing. Incidentally, I had sent a message to them a month or so ago that didn’t get a reply either. I don’t know who’s running the recruiting over at Georgia Tech, but they haven’t impressed me. I really don’t expect to get a reply from them at all.</p>
<p>So in summary, Michigan is really awesome at recruiting, VT is good. UC Irvine and Berkeley still haven’t sent me anything, but it’s only been 5 days. Still a long turnaround time, I think. Georgia Tech doesn’t seem to care about its prospective students.</p>
<p>Some schools have made me feel very excited to apply, others have given me the cold shoulder. While the academic strength of a program is really important, I think that the people skills of a department really reflect a lot as well.</p>
