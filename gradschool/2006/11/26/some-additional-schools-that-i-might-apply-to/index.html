        <p>I found a few more schools that have good looking programs that I‚Äôd be interested in applying to. With these two, my school count would go up to 7. I‚Äôm not too sure that‚Äôs playing it too safe, or not safe enough. Here are the additional schools and my reasoning for wanting to apply:</p>
<h2 id="cornell">Cornell <a href="#cornell" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Degree: <a href="https://www.infosci.cornell.edu/grad/">PhD in Information Science</a></p>
<p>Deadline: January 1, 2007</p>
<p>Notes: Cornell has a program similar to a few of the schools that I‚Äôm already planning on applying to. Right now, they only have a PhD program in Information Science, so I‚Äôd have to go that route.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not really too opposed to applying as a PhD student; I‚Äôm just not completely sure about studying for another 4-5 years as opposed to 2 years. The program at Cornell seems fairly multidisciplinary, with courses in communication, cognition, and social aspects of information. It seems like a nice program, if I can get into it.</p>
<h2 id="university-of-michigan">University of Michigan <a href="#university-of-michigan" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Degree: <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/msi/default.htm">Master of Science in Information</a></p>
<p>Deadline: February 5th, 2007.</p>
<p>Notes: The University of Michigan offers a Masters degree in Information. The program offers courses like ‚ÄúDesign of Complex Web Sites‚Äù and ‚ÄúComputer-Supported Cooperative Work.‚Äù</p>
<p>One interesting thing I found was that the website had <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/applying/subscribe.htm">links to school blogs</a>. There were a few from students, as well as an <a href="https://mblog.lib.umich.edu/sitrenches1/">Admissions Blog</a>. The admissions blog seems to have been set up specifically to help prospective students through the process. Very cool.</p>
